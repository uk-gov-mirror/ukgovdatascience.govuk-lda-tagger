/government/speeches/sarah-teather-in-nursery-world-on-graduate-funding-for-early-years-workforce,"A highly skilled early years workforce is critical if we are to combat inequality, help tackle poverty and improve the life chances of the most disadvantaged children. It’s simply not good enough that the highest early achievers from disadvantaged backgrounds are overtaken by more well-off, lower achieving children by the age of five. That’s why I’m delighted to announce in my column this week that we will continue to invest funding in graduate programmes in the financial year 2011 to 2012, and the Children’s Workforce Development Council (CWDC) will continue to deliver both the early years professional status (EYPS) and the new leaders in early years (New Leaders) programmes. There are now over 6,000 professionals with EYPS across the country and more than 4,000 currently in training. We know that graduate programmes are highly valued by those who have taken part, but also by the sector more widely. Indeed, a survey published this week by CWDC shows the EYPS programme helps to raise the status and confidence of graduate leaders who have achieved it. Both EYPs and qualified teachers working in the sector play a crucial role in not only improving the achievement of children, but also sharing knowledge and helping to improve the skills of other members of staff. In addition, New Leaders, a two-year programme to achieve EYPS and an early years master’s degree, will recruit graduates from outside the sector with the capability to be outstanding leaders in early years settings. Bringing different skills and a fresh way of looking at things, these graduates will help raise the profile and status of those working in the sector. Through these programmes, we’re committed to raising standards and improving the qualifications and skills of the workforce. But this shouldn’t be done through over-burdening or regulating the sector. This means moving away from the previous government’s target-driven approach and allowing local authorities to make decisions which reflect their communities’ needs. As I’ve said before in these pages, the Department for Education secured a good spending review settlement for early years services against a difficult economic backdrop. The Early Intervention Grant brings together funding for Sure Start, youth and family support for the most vulnerable children and will give local authorities greater freedom and flexibility in designing local services. This includes the recruitment and deployment of graduate leaders and investment in other qualifications to support the wider workforce. I do hope that local authorities will recognise the strong evidence for investing in a high-quality workforce when taking these decisions. The leading authorities are already planning how to target funding on areas and settings serving the children most likely to fall behind their peers at the age of 5. As well as supporting the development of a graduate-led workforce, we also need to help Sure Start children’s centre leaders to continue to develop their skills. Sure Start children’s centres are central to delivering high-quality early years care and support. We want centre leaders to understand how they can use their resources most effectively to target families most in need, with programmes that are proven to work. Graham Allen’s review on early intervention, published last week, will help to inform this approach. I’m really pleased that the National College will continue to support children’s centre leadership development - as set out in the Schools White Paper, ‘The Importance of Teaching’; including the highly successful National Professional Qualification in Integrated Centre Leadership (NPQICL) and Children’s Centre Leaders Network. I know there are some really powerful networks of children’s centre leaders being developed - providing a brilliant opportunity for leaders to hone their skills, share good practice and support each other. I am also looking forward to receiving Dame Clare Tickell’s review of the early years foundation stage (EYFS) in the spring - which is likely to contain recommendations that will impact on the early years workforce. CWDC will work closely with my department to ensure that future training programmes, including the EYPS and New Leaders, reflect any changes resulting from this review. There is a lot to feel confident about in the early years workforce. I hope the ongoing investment in graduate programmes, coupled with support for Sure Start centre leaders and local level investment, will help support a strong, graduate-led workforce into the future."
/guidance/emergencies-and-severe-weather-schools-and-early-years-settings,"Making an emergency plan The aim of an emergency plan is to help staff respond effectively to an emergency at school or on an educational visit. Your emergency plan should be generic enough to cover a range of potential incidents that could occur, including: serious injury to a pupil or member of staff (eg transport accident) significant damage to school property (eg fire) criminal activity (eg bomb threat) severe weather (eg flooding) public health incidents (eg flu pandemic) the effects of a disaster in the local community Your plan should cover procedures for incidents occurring during and outside school hours, including weekends and holidays. You should also include emergency procedures for extended services, such as breakfast clubs, after-school clubs and holiday activities. The planning process Preparing for emergencies is an ongoing process involving: risk assessment planning training exercises reviewing Throughout each stage of this process it is important to consult members of staff and governors to gain their involvement and support. School emergency plan template and guidance A school emergency plan template and accompanying guidance are available to download from Nottinghamshire County Council. Whether you adopt the template or choose to use your own, you can use the guidance to develop appropriate arrangements for your school. Resources Nottinghamshire County Council has also developed resources to help train staff and run exercises , including: risk assessment and planning templates training materials tabletop exercises You may not need to use all of these resources in order to have an effective emergency plan, and these documents shouldn’t replace any existing arrangements your school has in place. Your local authority may have already sent emergency planning guidance to your school. If so, please contact your local authority for advice before using these resources. Electronic storybooks, games and puzzles to use in classroom lessons on emergency planning are also available. The Cabinet Office has developed a single point of reference for emergency planning terminology . Severe weather During severe weather conditions, such as flooding or snow, you should keep your school or early years setting open for as many children as possible. However, it might be necessary to close temporarily due to inaccessibility or risk of injury. You should do all you can to reopen as soon as possible. If flooding has significantly affected your school or early years setting, you should contact our incident alert team . If you’re an early years provider and have had to move to temporary premises, you should check to see if you need to register with Ofsted at your new premises. School attendance statistics Where children are unable to get to school due to severe weather conditions, you can mark them in the register using absence code ‘Y’. This means that their absence won’t affect your school’s attendance figures. However, if you believe that a child could have got to school, their absence should be recorded as unauthorised using code ‘O’. Staff absence If some of your teachers can’t get to work, you should be flexible by, for example: bringing together groups and classes with teachers and support staff working together using other school staff or volunteers to provide cover supervision or oversee alternative activities re-arranging the curriculum Reception and other infant classes (children aged 5, 6 or 7) should normally be groups of 30 or fewer, but having more than 30 in one class due to temporary exceptional circumstances is not a reason to close the school or the class. Exam disruption You should prepare for possible disruption to exams as part of your emergency planning and make sure your staff are aware of these plans. If you have to close your school, or if a child misses an exam due to an emergency, you should discuss alternative arrangements with your awarding bodies. You are responsible for making sure parents and children know what has been agreed, for example: using alternative venues an exam result being generated by the awarding body, based on factors such as a child’s performance on other assessments in the same subject the opportunity for children to sit any missed exam later in the year Contact details [Contact:1629] Useful information You may find the following links useful when considering your plan: Cabinet Office: preparation and planning for emergencies Cabinet Office: pandemic flu DfE: health and safety advice for schools DfE: preventing extremism in the education and children’s services sectors DfE: school security: advice on access to, and barring of individuals from, school premises Met Office: severe weather warning system  "
/government/speeches/written-ministerial-statement-by-edward-timpson-on-voluntary-and-community-sector-prospectus,"The Department for Education is today publishing a National Prospectus launching our new Grants Programme for 2013-15. It also describes a number of additional key services and activities that we will be investing in for the benefit of children, young people and families over the course of the next two years. The package will be worth up to an estimated £60m made up of £30m of grant funding and £30m of contracts, in both 2013-14 and 2014-15. It follows the £60m annual grant investment in both 2011-12 and 2012-13, announced in February last year. That investment specifically included funding to help successful bidders remodel their long-term financing to help them reduce their dependence on central Government grants once the current two year funding period ends. The National Prospectus Grants Programme 2013-15 will provide up to £30m in grant funding each year in 2013-14 and 2014-15. The scheme will focus on delivering the following five priorities: Promote excellence in early education and childcare, so enabling all children to achieve success in their early years and later education. Develop and reform safeguarding services that protect and support children at risk of harm. Develop and reform the care system and speed up the process of adoption. Develop and reform services that support children with SEN, disabilities and other health needs. Focus and develop local services to support improved outcomes for young people, particularly the most disadvantaged and vulnerable. We are inviting applications from voluntary and community sector organisations, social enterprises and other organisations bidding on a “not for profit” basis. We hope to receive new, innovative proposals for work which can make a real difference on the ground and inform and guide national policy in our priority areas. Funding will be available for two years from 1 April 2013. The grants programme application process opens today. Bids must be received by noon on the 30 November 2012. The accompanying grants prospectus sets out the details of the bidding process. In addition to the Grants Programme we will be continuing to invest in services for children, young people and their families through funding a number of services for specific activities that meet our policy priorities. The Prospectus provides brief details of a number of contracted services which we expect to procure in the coming months. We expect to make announcements about contracts for a range of new relationship support services later this year. We have also recently announced that we will be continuing funding for a number of online and telephone family support services. Taken together in conjunction with the Grants Programme we estimate up to £60m will be made available to support these activities and services for children and families in each year in 2013-14 and 2014-15. A copy of the National Prospectus has been placed in the House Libraries.

This includes information on: provider characteristics number of places and children attending staff characteristics qualifications of staff profitability of providers Key breakdowns are by types of providers, region, and levels of deprivation. Where appropriate, comparisons are made with previous waves of the survey, largely the 2010, 2009, 2008, 2007 and 2006 waves. Key findings In 2011 the survey recorded 107,900 childcare and early years providers in England, of which 15,700 were early years providers in maintained schools and 92,200 were childcare providers. This marks a slight increase from the figures in 2010, when the survey recorded a total of 105,100 childcare and early years settings. The survey recorded a total of 48,800 active childminders in 2011, an increase of 3% on the 47,400 who were active in 2010. In 2011, there were an estimated 462,500 vacancies across all types of provider, compared to an estimated 440,800 vacancies in 2010. There were 134,600 vacancies in full day care settings. In 2011 the estimated total number of paid and unpaid staff stands at 426,500. The total number of staff working across all childcare and early years settings decreased by 2% between 2010 and 2011, this include both paid and unpaid staff. There was a marked decrease in the number of unpaid staff, which fell by 19% between 2010 and 2011. The large majority of staff in group-based childcare settings had a relevant qualification at level 3 (79%) in 2011. This is a significant increase from the figure of 65% in 2007 and marks progress from the 2010 figure of 76%. The proportion of childminders with a level 3 qualification had also increased, from 54% in 2010 to 59% in 2011. The proportion of settings reporting that they had made a profit was on a par with the proportions seen in 2010. Amongst full day care settings, the proportion making a loss fell from 19% in 2010 to 12% in 2011. In sessional settings the equivalent decrease was from 20% to 14%, while holiday clubs fell from 23% in 2010 to 18% in 2011. Explanatory note about amendments Amendments have been made to the childcare and early years providers survey 2011 following the identification of a small issue with certain weights in the dataset that had been applied to the ‘other paid staff’ from sessional childcare settings. This resulted in minor errors in some of the tables covering pay (chapter 5) and qualifications (chapter 6) for sessional providers. Maura Lantrua 0114 274 2064 maura.lantrua@education.gsi.gov.uk"

Key breakdowns are by types of providers, region, and levels of deprivation. Where appropriate, comparisons are made with previous waves of the survey, largely the 2009, 2008, 2007 and 2006 waves. Key findings from the survey: In 2010 the survey recorded 105,100 providers of childcare and early years education, of which 15,700 were early years providers in maintained schools and 89,500 were childcare providers. The long-term decrease in the number of active childminders continued in 2010 and the total now stands at 47,400. This marks a decrease of 7% since 2009 (in contrast to the other types of childcare provider whose numbers increased in 2010). In 2010, there were an estimated 440,800 vacancies across all types of provider. Around a quarter of these (28%) were to be found in full day care settings, where there were 122,700 vacancies. With the exception of sessional providers, there has been an increase in the estimated number of paid and unpaid staff working in all types of childcare settings since 2005, and the estimated total across all types of setting now stands at 434,100.

/government/news/childcare-support-will-be-paid-to-around-80000-more-households,"Reaffirming their commitment to helping parents with the costs of childcare, the Government will invest an additional £300 million into childcare support under Universal Credit, on top of the £2bn already spent under the current system.   Currently, childcare support is only available if you work 16 hours or more, but the Government is removing the minimum hours rule so that all families receiving Universal Credit will be eligible for financial help. This means that families on low incomes will receive more support to keep them in work.   As now families will be able to recover childcare costs at 70 per cent - up to £175 for one child or £300 for two or more children per week.  The money will paid through Universal Credit from 2013 and will mean that around 80,000 more families with children will be able to work the hours they choose.    Deputy Prime Minister, Nick Clegg said: Childcare support is vitally important. It’s a lifeline for families up and down the country, particularly for mums who want to get back into work, maybe for just a few hours a week after they’ve had children. This will help an extra 80,000 families who have previously had no help at all with childcare costs. We all know how difficult it is sometimes to juggle family and work but this is really good news, especially for lone parents and mums up and down the country. I want to ensure that this Coalition Government is there for families of all shapes and sizes and help them with the difficult daily juggling act between family and work. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said: We are determined to help more parents take their first steps into work, but under the current minimum hours rule parents are trapped in state dependency without the childcare support they badly need - providing yet another barrier to work. Under Universal Credit more people will receive support for childcare than they do now. Parents will be able to work the hours to suit their families and receive the childcare support they deserve. We will target support at those making the first steps into work - support won’t just be available for those working more than 16 hours, it will also be there for those working fewer than 16 hours. The additional support, combined with State funded free early years education for younger children will enable parents of children of any age to bring together full time paid employment with parenting, and will ensure that those with school age children can meet their job search obligations.   Costs can vary, but for those paying average childcare costs, this would enable parents to buy up to around 40 hours of childcare a week.   The limits will also be applied monthly giving parents more flexibility to manage fluctuating costs at peak times, such as school holiday periods when they may face higher costs some weeks and lower costs on other weeks. Notes to editors In the 2010 Spending Review the Government protected the universal entitlement to 15 hours a week of free childcare for all 3 and 4 year olds, and extended it for the first time to disadvantaged 2-year olds. Universal Credit will create one single income-replacement benefit for working age adults, including childcare costs for working parents. This childcare policy will cost an additional £300m per year. Universal Credit is on track to start on time in 2013 to secure a Welfare State fit for the 21st Century. Over the following four years we will convert 19 million claims under the existing out-of-work benefits and tax credits system to eight million household payments under Universal Credit.  The scale of the IT delivery is similar to that for Employment Support Allowance which was successfully delivered by DWP on time and within budget (October 2008)."
/government/news/professor-cathy-nutbrown-speaks-at-the-early-years-conference,"Please note that the speech below may not reflect the exact words of the speaker. Good morning everyone. I am very pleased to be invited to speak at this event today and to be able to take this opportunity to launch my report and recommendations following my Review of Early Education and Childcare Qualifications This has been an incredible experience that will stay with me for quite some time. Over the course of my Review I have been impressed by the sheer levels of commitment and passion shown by so many people in different roles working with our young children – from the Apprentice starting out in their career to the experienced teacher leading practice – all of who are determined to make a truly valuable contribution in the foundation years. Those of you I have met will know of my commitment to high quality early education. I felt, therefore, extremely privileged to be asked by the Minister of State to undertake such an important task. Even more so, I have been overwhelmed by the number of people who have written to say how much they welcomed what has been seen as a much needed Review. The focus of my report grew out of Dame Clare Tickell’s Review on the Early Years Foundation Stage which highlighted the importance of having qualifications that are of a high standard and meet the needs of all learners. It is very clear to me that we can’t achieve an excellent early years without effective qualification structures which ultimately gives us a highly qualified workforce. In thinking carefully about this I am led by my strong belief that we need a new long-term vision for the early years workforce. I also believe that this vision must offer the very best for babies and young children by having a professional and highly skilled workforce which leads to getting the best investment in early years. All of this points clearly to the fact that quality matters in early years. Ultimately the biggest quality factor is staff who determine good quality. Which means staff having good skills, strong pedagogical knowledge, understanding and passion when working with children - these are all crucial factors. Underpinning these are robust qualifications and training that can have a powerful effect when they are taught well and ensure those training to enter the workforce can be supported to develop the right blend of theoretical knowledge and practical skills. This does not take away the importance of attunement and care which are hugely important in work with young children. I have heard many arguments that seem to polarise care and education of course we must have both – we can’t settle for less. Our babies and young children deserve the best start. Some people question whether babies should be included in my Review. This leads me to the point I want to make absolutely clear today. Learning begins from birth - and our early years workforce does so much more than changing nappies and wiping noses – the responsibilities of all those working with young children are immense. High quality care and education meets all children’s learning and developmental needs from birth. The importance of early communication with babies during their early months of life is well known and this is essential for establishing social relationships as babies and young children begin to formulate, and play with language. High quality care and education means having the skills and experience to work with infant appropriate pedagogies, looking listening and loving alongside the capacity to stimulate and challenge children to ask questions, to explore, to play and to seek answers. All of which become hugely significant for children as they move through the foundation stage and into primary phase of education. There is the growing body of evidence about how the quality of early years provision can support children’s brain development and make such a positive difference to children’s life chances – and their future participation in our society. In the last few years, it has become increasingly clear – although most of us never doubted it - that effective early years provision offer the foundations for children’s healthy all-round development. Studies such as the Effective Provision of Pre-school Education (EPPE) and other research have provided strong evidence to show the impact of highly qualified staff on children’s outcomes. In particular we know that better qualified staff teams offered higher quality support for children developing communication, language and literacy skills and their reasoning, thinking and mathematical skills, as providing well as higher overall curricular quality. Almost one hundred years ago the Government of 1918 legislated for the establishment of nursery schools. Subsequently, nursery education which included concern for children’s health and well being were established around the country. We need to exploit our rich legacy of early childhood education as well as the current research of evidence which tells us that babies and young children are born with an immense capacity to learn. I am very grateful to all those who participated in my Review – people who work on daily basis with young children, in a variety of settings – organisations representing providers – parents - and academics. All these contributions have been essential as I have developed my understanding of the issues, and shaped my recommendations. The work leading up to the publication of my interim report provided some stark findings and I have to say I was shocked by some of the things I found. It is apparent that early years qualifications have changed markedly over the last two decades and there are literally hundreds of qualifications past and present creating a market that is over populated and confused. Add to this the variation in content and teaching of these qualifications and I am left with the inescapable conclusion that many are not ‘fit for purpose’. Put simply, I do not believe that many of the current qualifications are good enough to equip the workforce with the knowledge and skills necessary to offer children the best quality care and education, and to support professional development. This is of particular concern when we consider the very welcome investment being made by the Government in expanding the number of free places in the system. If qualifications are not equipping people with what they need, if we cannot be confident that staff are learning what they need to, how can we be confident in the quality of provision they offer? Over the course of my Review I have focussed on three key areas: What are people studying, and whether this they need to know? In terms of quality, are the systems in place to ensure the quality of teaching and learning are effective? And finally, how do we recruit people to take a qualification and into work? How do qualifications systems impact on the perceived status of those who work with young children? My final recommendations seek to respond to these issues. And I am confident my findings and recommendations reflect and respond to what the early years workforce has told me is most important. They are rooted in putting quality at the top of the agenda. What is important is that we secure good value for money, spending on early education and care needs to bring about high quality, that is sound investment in the future. So let me briefly summarise my key recommendations. These take account of a reformed system of qualifications; and a balance which must be struck between supporting existing good practice and challenging the sector to ensure provision is high quality in all settings. Firstly we need a clear, rigorous system of qualifications in place to ensure a competent and confident workforce. As I have said there are far too many qualifications, they don’t equip students with the necessary skills and the system is confusing. In response I recommend the content of qualifications be changed to strengthen and include more on child development and play, special educational needs and disability, and inclusivity and diversity. More importantly the qualifications must focus on the birth to 7 age range. Level 3 must become the minimum standard for the workforce. This means all staff, who work to the EYFS framework, including childminders should be qualified at a minimum level 3 by September 2022, with some staging of posts in the interim. It is crucial that we raise expectations of the workforce so that we attract the best people – quality staff make a difference. When I published my interim the press heavily focused on my view of literacy and numeracy skills amongst staff caring and educating our babies and young children. These skills are essential: to develop professional knowledge; to communicate effectively with parents; to carry out observations or assessments, to read stories to children and to support children’s early language development. This reinforces my argument for the importance of quality and why I am recommending students must have a level 2 in English and mathematics upon entry to a level 3 early education or childcare course. I have also made recommendations on the quality of student placements and for tutors to remain up to date in their own Continuous Professional Development and to maintain relevant and current early years practice. I particularly want to emphasise the importance of Continuous Professional Development for new early years staff and setting managers and practitioners should actively prioritise this. I am therefore recommending all new staff are given mentoring support for at least their first six months of employment. I don’t see this as a Government-led bureaucratic approach – rather, I believe the sector has the maturity and drive to make this happen. Lack of a clear career progression route featured highly in my Review. I received a number of comments from the sector about increasing the number of people with Qualified Teacher Status in the early years sector as a way of improving the quality and professionalism. The evidence backed up by views expressed during the Review so far is very clear on the importance of staff with higher level skills and the sector seems to be supporting the idea of strong leadership at all levels, but in particular recognises the impact that those with teaching qualifications can have. The status of the profession is intrinsically linked to the qualifications market, so raising the bar on entry requirements and demanding higher levels of qualifications can help to demonstrate a commitment to a high status profession. I wholeheartedly agree with the arguments supporting this and therefore I am recommending an introduction of an early years specialist route to Qualified Teacher Status, (birth to seven years). The Government’s drive to include more graduates through Early Years Professional Status programme was welcomed and made efforts to transform the quality of early years practice. In my Review concerns were made by many who hold Early Years Professional Status were being dissatisfied with their lack of parity with those holding Qualified Teacher Status. I have been impressed with the level of commitment and knowledge shown by many with Early Years Professional Status I have met. The subject knowledge imparted by Early Years Professional Status is valuable and I see the early years specialist initial teacher education route as building on the strengths of the Early Years Professional Status. I firmly believe having qualified teachers leading early years settings is the future. It will increase professionalism and raise the status of the profession, and those with EYPS can be part of this. Finally, many have suggested I recommend the introduction of an early years licensing system. There has been consistent interest and I have heard convincing and thought provoking debates. Some have suggested a ‘Royal College of Early Education approach similar to other ‘Royal Colleges’ because they would give the sector recognition, help to boost public confidence as well as improving self esteem and expertise across the sector However, when I think about why we should introduce licensing and I ultimately come to the question of what added value this would bring in light of the other recommendations I am proposing. The main intended benefits would be to improve quality and to raise the status of the profession. However, I believe my recommendations if accepted by Government would clearly address these. I certainly don’t think the time is right for the Government to mandate a new licensing system. I do feel, if the sector wants to come together with a unified approach, that Government should support this. To conclude, then, my intention has always been to propose a set of recommendations that address the issues I have heard, based on the evidence brought out through my call for evidence and the many conversations I have had. My recommendations aim to move towards a long term vision for a better, higher qualified and more professional early years workforce. It will be for the Government and the sector to decide how they want to take forward my recommendations, how to make this vision a reality. It will not happen over night and of course I don’t underestimate the practical and financial implications. I have endeavoured to make my recommendations practicable and affordable. However, what my report makes absolutely clear is that we cannot afford to compromise on the quality of provision. This means making sure those who are entrusted with the care and education of our babies and young children are equipped with the skills, knowledge and understanding they need. Poor quality provision will mean that young children pay a heavy price – they will miss out. I want again to thank the Minister for asking me to lead this Review. I also want to thank the thousands in the early years sector who have contributed. The passion and dedication of so many who work with and for young children (in some instances without the recognition they deserve) has been palpable. Together, we can raise our sights and ensure that the Early Education and Care provision continues to progress and improve. Young children need high quality experiences as they learn and develop in their first five years. I hope the Government acts on my recommendations and – in the interests of all young children – and their families. Thank you."
/government/news/childcare-qualifications-overhaul,"As part of the government’s overhaul of training and qualifications in childcare and early education, the National College of Teaching and Leadership ( NCTL ) is today setting out more detail on what will be expected of the new early years teachers and early years educators. Early years teachers will be graduate leaders in early years settings on a par with school teachers. They will need to meet new standards , published today, which closely mirror the standards for classroom teachers, and trainees will need to take the same skills tests taken by classroom teacher trainees. These measures will raise the status of the profession and help attract high-quality graduates into early education. Early years educators will hold A level equivalent qualifications and provide support to early years teachers. At the moment employers and parents are faced with a bewildering number of qualifications, making it almost impossible to know which staff are best able to provide high-quality early education. Under new criteria published today, only the very best qualifications will earn the ‘early years educator’ label. Ministers hope that employers and parents will come to recognise the early years teacher and early years educator titles as benchmarks of quality. NCTL chief executive Charlie Taylor said: There is nothing more important in early education and childcare than the quality of the staff who are delivering it. The workforce supporting our babies, young children and their parents should be well-qualified, well-respected and well-led. A third of children start school without basic language and communication skills. In poorer areas, this rises to more than 4 in 10. Highly skilled and qualified staff, who understand how children learn and develop, who inspire and engage children, and who have good curriculum knowledge and teach effectively, are key to changing this. The new early years educator criteria and Teachers’ Standards (early years) will help ensure children are ready to make the most of the opportunities available to them as they move through nursery, key stage 1 and into more formal education. Education Minister Elizabeth Truss said: Good quality early years education, which is teacher-led, has been shown to be beneficial for children, especially those from low income backgrounds. It makes a difference to young children’s lives and enables them to learn and grow. It is important for parents to have a choice of different approaches in early years - including teacher-led activity such as story telling; singing and dancing; structured group activities where children learn to interact with each other; and free play and exploration. When parents hand their child over to the care of a childminder or nursery they are not just entrusting them with their child’s physical safety; they are also entrusting their child’s brain. These changes will mean parents and employers can have more confidence in the quality of the staff looking after their children. Early years educators will be expected to have English and maths GCSEs so that parents know the people they are entrusting their children to will have literacy and numeracy skills. The more robust early years educator criteria will help to slim down the number of qualifications in the future so it is easier for parents and employers to understand them. The criteria and standards are designed to allow for a range of pedagogical approaches or learning styles. This gives professionals the freedom and flexibility to deploy a range of methods and to decide how best to structure children’s activities throughout the day. These include a combination of teacher-led group activities where children learn to interact with each other; such as using shape sorter, using bricks and Lego to build, story-time - and free play and exploration. Andreas Schleicher of the OECD has said that “staff qualifications are one of the strongest predictors of the quality of early childhood education and care.” Similarly, Sir Michael Wilshaw states that leaders of high-quality early years settings are “not afraid to teach children and to ensure that their staff are highly skilled adults who improve the vocabulary, cognitive and social skills of very young children, particularly when they are not able to gain them at home.” Early years teachers and early years educators are at the heart of the government’s childcare reforms. Today’s publication of the Teachers’ Standards (early years) and early years educators criteria will offer an opportunity to raise the status of the profession, and deliver better quality care and teaching for children in the early years. Professor Pat Preedy, GEMS Chief Academic Officer; Early Childhood Education and ISA representative said: Early childhood is the time of greatest brain development and learning. These qualifications provide a framework to ensure that we have highly trained and skilled professionals who understand child development and how to support children to achieve the best outcomes. We have moved away from the old arguments of play versus formal approaches. Professionals are able to use a range of techniques to meet the age, stage and needs of young children. I am particularly pleased that transition to school is included as education should be a continuous and seamless process. Dr Jo Saxton, Director of Education, Future Academies said: The new EYE qualifications criteria and Teachers’ Standards set a high, but achievable standard; one which demonstrates how carefully the government and NCTL have thought about how to ensure that our young are both nurtured and given a head-start in their education. This is in the interest of both the children who will benefit directly, as well as in the interest of our nation. As a nation which formalises education at a younger age than some others, we have a duty to ensure this time is well-used. The new criteria and standards represent the intention of the government, NCTL and the practitioners and experts who contributed to them, to do just that. Notes to editors The government’s publication ‘More great childcare’ (January 2013) sets out the vision for quality in early education and childcare. It included the government’s response to Professor Cathy Nutbrown’s report ‘Foundations for quality’ published in June 2012. NCTL ran a consultation on the Teachers’ Standards (early years), which underpin the training and assessment of early years teachers, and a separate consultation on early years educator criteria. This is criteria that all level 3 qualifications have to meet. The new early years educator criteria is on GOV.UK. The government’s response to the early years educator criteria consultation can be found on the department’s e-consultations site. The new Teachers’ Standards (early years) is available on GOV.UK. The government’s response to the Teachers’ Standards (early years) is available on the department’s e-consultations site. From September, early years teacher trainees will have to meet the same entry requirements as primary trainee teachers - including at least a GCSE grade C in English, mathematics and science, or equivalent. From September 2014, trainees will have to pass the same skills test as classroom teacher trainees before they start their course. [Contact:997]"

/government/news/child-poverty-strategy-launched,"Supporting families into work, improving living standards and raising educational attainment are the fundamental aims set out in the government’s child poverty strategy, published today (26 June 2014). As part of the government’s long-term economic plan to build a fairer society, the strategy sets out what is being done to tackle the root causes of child poverty, building on the first strategy published in 2011. The government remains committed to the goal of ending child poverty in the UK by 2020 by breaking the cycle of disadvantage based on the principle that where someone starts in life should not determine where they end up. Work is the best route out of poverty, with a child in a workless family 3 times as likely to be in relative poverty compared to a family where at least 1 parent works. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said: “This strategy outlines our commitment to tackling the root causes of poverty and delivering lasting change that makes a real difference to children’s life chances. “Despite tough economic times over the last few years, we’ve introduced reforms to the welfare system that are transforming the lives of the most vulnerable in our society. As part of the government’s long-term economic plan we are supporting more families into work, improving living standards and raising educational attainment. “Work remains the best route out of poverty and with the economy now growing again we have more people in work than ever before, as well as fewer children in workless households than at any time since records began. These children now not only have a wage-earner in the household, but perhaps even more importantly, they also have a role model to look up to.” Schools Minister David Laws said: “It is impossible to overstate the impact poverty can have on a child’s education. “I am proud of the progress we have already made – investing £3.75 billion in the Pupil Premium, being used by schools to close the attainment gap and we have now extended the Pupil Premium to 3 and 4 year olds. In addition, from September all infant school children will receive a healthy meal for free, to make sure they are ready to learn and can get the most from their time at school. “Poorer children are doing better than ever at school but still more than 6 out of 10 still fail to secure good grades. We are determined to improve the prospects of all children so that they have the best possible opportunities later in life.” Good progress has already been made in tackling child poverty. Despite the tough economic climate, employment has increased by nearly 1.7 million since 2010 and there are now record numbers of people in work. Since 2010 the number of children aged under 16 in workless households has fallen by 290,000 and there are 300,000 fewer children living in relative income poverty. Poor children are also doing better than ever at school, with the proportion of children on free school meals getting 5 good GCSEs including English and maths increasing from 31% in 2010 to 38% in 2013. Actions set out in the strategy which the government are taking from 2014 to 2017 to tackle child poverty include the following. Supporting families into work by: helping businesses to create jobs helping people to take up work through Jobcentre Plus and schemes such as the Work Programme and the Troubled Families Programme making work pay and having clearer work incentives through introducing Universal Credit, with more help for childcare tackling low pay by raising the minimum wage and the personal tax allowance, continuing to lift low-income families out of the tax system helping people move on to better jobs and improving the qualifications of parents through adult apprenticeships, investing in English and maths and helping parents through the National Careers Service Reducing costs to support people’s living standards by: reducing energy, extending the Warm Home Discount and helping people to make their homes more energy efficient capping the bills of low-income families with 3 or more children on a water meter and promoting social tariffs reducing food costs for low-income families through introducing free school meals for all infant school pupils alongside Healthy Start Vouchers for young children, breakfast clubs in deprived areas, and free fruit and vegetables at school for primary school children reducing transport costs for low-income families increasing access to affordable credit for low income families through expanding credit unions Raising educational attainment by: increasing the number of poor children getting quality pre-school education introducing an Early Years Pupil Premium to help ensure 3 and 4 year olds from the most disadvantaged backgrounds get the best start in life ensuring poor children do better at school by giving disadvantaged pupils an additional £14,000 throughout their school career – a £2.5 billion a year commitment through the Pupil Premium supporting poor children to stay in education post-16 through training, apprenticeships, traineeships, and better careers advice helping parents provide the best possible home environment by supporting parenting classes and providing free books to poor families helping parents who experience mental health issues, investing in drug and alcohol dependency treatment and supporting young carers increasing support for children with Special Educational Needs More information The Child Poverty Act 2010 requires us to set a persistent child poverty target by December 2014.

/government/case-studies/gypsy-roma-and-traveller-pupils-supporting-access-to-education,"Gypsy, Roma and Traveller ( GRT ) pupils are among the lowest achieving groups of pupils at every key stage of education, although some GRT pupils achieve very well at school. There are many complex and interwoven factors that may influence the educational attainment of GRT pupils. Schools and local authorities can make a big difference to their life chances through: clear high expectations of all pupils, regardless of their background an inclusive culture that welcomes all communities strong engagement from parents Kingsholm Primary School (Gloucestershire) Compared to reception year, this primary school has a much higher proportion of pupils of Traveller ethnicity and pupils joining the school later. The school reports that most GRT pupils have good attendance and attainment. Ofsted has rated Kingsholm Primary as outstanding. Strong community relations Ofsted recognises the school’s successful promotion of good relations between pupils from different communities and its refusal to tolerate discrimination of any kind. Initiatives designed to prevent discrimination include whole school assemblies to raise awareness of GRT culture. High expectations of attendance Kingsholm Primary also has rigorous attendance systems, with the same high expectations for all pupils’ attendance, regardless of their ethnicity. There is a named attendance officer who works closely with GRT parents to ensure they understand the possible sanctions for any unauthorised absence. The attendance officer follows up any cases of lateness or absence on the same day. Working with occupationally mobile families The school has good relations with its Showmen families, working closely with them to plan any periods of travelling for work, helping to minimise disruption to pupils’ education. For example, the school encourages Showmen to try to arrange their work so that pupils can attend the school at the start of term and to dual register their children at 2 or more schools while they travel. Shirley Community Nursery and Primary School (Cambridgeshire) Around half of all children at Shirley Primary are from minority ethnic backgrounds, with around 90 children of GRT ethnicity. Ofsted’s most recent report notes that Traveller children are making good progress at the school. Ofsted has rated Shirley Primary as good. Identifying the concerns The school works with GRT pupils and parents to identify any concerns. This includes: pupil voice interviews with GRT children about their attitudes to school and homework to inform the school’s understanding of any issues they experience consultations with parents, including a questionnaire to capture their main concerns and assess the level of interest in future events for parents Parental engagement The school identified that GRT parents lacked confidence in their knowledge of what their children are learning in maths and phonics, and how they might support these areas at home. The school’s interventions included: a jointly run session with the on-site children’s centre for GRT parents, invited personally by school staff (one such session, recognising that GRT communities have an oral story culture, supported parents to understand how to construct a written story, and gave them a ‘story sack’ resource to support their children’s learning at home) support for children beginning school, including introductory sessions for parents and children on the main areas of learning that will be covered at school, and expectations of good attendance and behaviour regular tailored update letters to GRT parents on their children’s progress in reception class The school reports higher levels of usage of the children’s centre, improved parental engagement and a smoother transition from early years provision to primary school. Wisbech St Mary CoE Primary School (Cambridgeshire) This small primary school has around 160 pupils, with a large minority of Gypsies and Irish Travellers. The school reports good attainment of GRT pupils up to key stage 2. Ofsted has rated Wisbech St Mary Primary as good. Supporting transition to secondary school Having identified that GRT parents were more likely than other communities to opt for home education after primary school, the school put into place additional support for their transition to secondary school. Their actions included: a designated teaching assistant and home liaison officer from Cambridgeshire’s Traveller Education Team working with parents to identify and alleviate common concerns, such as explaining the secondary school’s anti-bullying policies to the parents year 5 and 6 pupils spending a day at a local secondary school to carry out an enterprise project, looking at what they will learn in secondary school and how it will improve their employment prospects. parent-and-child visits to the secondary school to familiarise themselves with the building and staff Parkside Community Primary School (Kent) This small primary school has a higher-than-average number of pupils of Romany or Gypsy heritage. Ofsted reports that pupils’ achievement, including those of GRT heritage, is good and improving across the school. Ofsted has rated the school as good overall. Promoting an inclusive ethos To achieve these results, Parkside School has: set high expectations from the senior management team for the attainment, attendance and inclusion of all pupils, including GRT children raised awareness of GRT history and culture through assemblies and events like book week, including oral storytelling ensured all staff attend Kent local authority’s training to develop awareness of GRT history and culture adopted a no-tolerance approach to bullying"

/government/news/a-focused-inspection-of-wiltshires-early-years-providers,"Ofsted today has published the outcome letter from a focused inspection of 8 early years settings in March and found only half were judged good or better. As well as the visits to 8 providers, inspectors conducted telephone surveys with a further 11 providers and held a focus group discussion with the local authority and its partners. The inspection was prompted by the wide gap in learning and development outcomes for the poorest young children compared to their more affluent peers. Only 36 per cent of children eligible for free school meals achieved a good level of development in 2014, making Wiltshire the third worst local authority in the South West region. Inspectors judged half of those inspected to be inadequate or requires improvement. In these weaker settings children made insufficient progress in their learning and development because the quality of teaching and learning were found to be not effective enough. However, inspectors did find signs of improvement. There is a clear strategy to improve early childhood provision in the area and there are well established partnerships with a wide range of providers to support its early years activities. In addition, the recent focus on supporting disadvantaged communities by increasing provision for funded places for two-year-olds is well directed. Bradley Simmons, Ofsted Director for the South West said: The local authority has provided some helpful training along with additional funding to enable early years settings to further develop their provision for funded two-years-olds. However, much still needs to improve. It cannot be right that the poorest young children in Wiltshire are not able to master basic skills such as being able to hold a pencil, count to 20, listen to a story or express themselves. Good learning and development is vital if children are to grasp the basics skills before they start primary school. As a result we have provided a number of recommendations the local authority should consider, particularly to those childcare providers, on meeting the needs of the poorest children. Ofsted recommends that the local authority should consider: targeting high quality information, advice and training to weaker providers to ensure that young children in the most disadvantaged areas access the best provision continuing to provide information, training and advice as required to help practitioners further their early years knowledge, skills and experience using Ofsted’s inspection evidence, to encourage providers to strengthen their monitoring of teaching and progress made by groups of children so that settings have clear evidence of what they do well and what they need to improve Ends Notes to editors The focused inspection outcomes letter for Wiltshire Council . Inspectors carried out eight inspections including childminders, pre-schools, an out of school club and a nursery. Settings that were inspected were all due for an inspection during the spring term 2015 and were scheduled during the two-week window (16-23 March) of the focused inspection. The Office for Standards in Education, Children’s Services and Skills (Ofsted) regulates and inspects to achieve excellence in the care of children and young people, and in education and skills for learners of all ages. It regulates and inspects childcare and children’s social care, and inspects the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service (Cafcass), schools, colleges, initial teacher training, work-based learning and skills training, adult and community learning, and education and training in prisons and other secure establishments.

/government/publications/the-early-education-pilot-for-two-year-old-children-age-five-follow-up,"The original evaluation of the early education pilot for 2-year-old children compared the outcomes for children in the pilot when they were aged 3 with a comparison group of children who were matched on a range of characteristics. This report looks at the same children’s outcomes when they are aged 5 to explore if there are any longer-term benefits for the children who took part in the pilot. The outcome data is taken from the early years foundation stage (EYFS) assessments. These are carried out in schools by teachers in the year that children turn five. This study also examines if children who took part in the pilot were more likely to take up early education when they were 3- or 4-years-old. This is an indirect measure of the pilot’s benefit as attending high quality early education has a positive effect on children’s outcomes. Both the EYFS data and the data on take-up of early years education at age three or four were extracted from the national pupil database (NPD)."
/government/news/1-million-in-grants-paid-out-as-childcare-scheme-hits-milestone,"Budding nursery owners or childminders are being encouraged to apply for a slice of £1 million to help them set up their own businesses. The Childcare Business Grant Scheme is available to support self-employed people who want to set up their own childcare business and provides help with costs such as training, equipment and adapting premises. The scheme today hits a milestone with £1 million paid out, with a further £1 million still available. Nicky Morgan, Minister for Women and Equalities said: The childcare business grant is a key part of our long-term economic plan. It has already benefited thousands of people, from nursery owners and childminders to the children of parents who use them. We know that it can be tough setting up your own business. This money is a helping hand for people who care about children and want to work looking after them. It will also encourage the creation of more childcare places, a key part of our plan to help parents who want to get back to work after having children. To celebrate the milestone, Children’s Minister Sam Gyimah today visited the Brown Bears Nursery in Tottenham, which owner Cheryl Brown opened up after accessing a grant. Children’s Minister Sam Gyimah said: We know that parents want good-quality, affordable and available childcare. The childcare business grant encourages the creation of more places, helping mothers get back to work. This money is a fantastic opportunity for anyone who wants to set up their own business to look after children. If you are thinking about taking the first steps towards becoming a childminder or nursery owner then I encourage you to apply. The grants offer £500 for those looking to start nurseries or look after disabled children, and £250 to prospective childminders. So far, more than 4,500 grants have been paid out. As part of the Childcare Business Grant Scheme, new childcare businesses are also being encouraged to team up with a free mentor so they can access free and specially-tailored start-up advice.

/government/speeches/edward-timpson-speaks-about-mental-health-services-for-young-people,"Thank you. It’s a pleasure to be here. And I am extremely grateful for choosing a location quite so close to Parliament. I would have no excuses for being late - so I’ve passed the first hurdle I hope. Anyway, it’s great to be here, and a pleasure to be hosted by YoungMinds. It looks like you’ve had a hugely productive day. And I’m grateful for the chance to set out what we’re doing at the Department for Education for young people and mental health. Mental health matters It’s worth reminding ourselves of our starting point. That is, that mental health matters. Now that sounds like a spectacular statement of the obvious - and I know that it’s something that everyone here will agree with. But it’s a principle that, all too often, governments forgot. For too long, mental health was the Cinderella service - unrecognised and unthanked. And when it came to young people, there was a double injustice, too - as child and adolescent services often received even less attention than adult services in political debate. Of course, governments can save millions in the criminal justice, education and health systems, when mental health treats conditions early. But much more important than any fiscal motive, improving mental health is simply the right thing to do. Take good education - probably the best guarantee of future success. We know that young people with mental health problems are more likely to struggle at school. If they don’t get the support they need to succeed, we reduce their chances of living and earning well as adults. NICE guidance suggests almost 60% of looked-after children struggle with emotional and mental health. Ninety-five per cent of imprisoned young offenders have a mental health disorder. More than half of all adults with mental health problems were diagnosed in childhood - and the majority of them didn’t receive appropriate treatment at the time. In other words, when we’re talking about mental health, so often, we’re talking about young people in the care of the state, or about people who were let down when they were young. If we don’t have a good mental health system - if we don’t have services that accurately identify who needs treatment, provides it, and then follows it up - then not only are we stunting the ambition of many young people. We are failing some of the most vulnerable people in society. And that’s simply not acceptable. And this is what drives us: a sense of clarity about who stands to benefit if we get mental health right - or to look at it the other way, will suffer, if we don’t. It’s why we believe mental health is essential, and that only full equality with physical health will do. What we’ve done so far And you can see that principle in our education policies. Whether it’s funding NSPCC to run ChildLine and HelpLine, for example, or YoungMinds to provide a helpline for parents with mental health difficulties - an essential service, comparable to the contact lines the NHS provides. Or look at guidance for early years education. The early years foundation stage has 3 main areas: communication development; physical development; and personal, social and emotional development. And all are given equal status. That’s the approach for school-age education, too. Ofsted have made it clear that they expect schools to look at the ‘whole child’, and will focus inspections on outcomes, rather than meddling in process and telling teachers how to teach. Together with a slimmed down curriculum, this gives schools more freedom to add skill- and character-building activities, promoting the wider wellbeing of children. And schools now get money targeted at the pupils that need it most. Poor mental health is often linked to economic deprivation. Not always, but often. So our pupil premium funnels funding to those schools with the poorest children. Lots of schools are using it to buy in extra pastoral support, making learning easier by giving vulnerable children greater emotional and mental stability. And for children leaving care - who, as we’ve seen, are especially likely to suffer from mental health problems - we top that up with an extra £1000. It’s going by the name of the pupil premium plus, and goes straight to schools. Schools doing great work And schools are doing some excellent work in mental health. Like St Marylebone CE School, just a few miles up the road in the borough of Westminster. It’s built mental health and wellbeing into its curriculum alongside physical health. Teachers are trained to give practical mental health advice, and pupils get the chance to try activities with benefits for mental and physical health - like yoga, or boxercise. Or look at Hardenuish School, in Chippenham - which has developed PSHE lessons that tackle difficult issues like self-harm, bereavement or anxiety head-on. Their format allows pupils to air issues in a safe, open environment, and for the school’s pastoral team to help at-risk pupils. Ofsted noted that this means pupils ‘feel safe, and can explain in detail issues around their own safety.’ Or Compton School, in North London. They’ve built strong links with outside services. Barnet council bring 2 mental health projects to visit the school, while Catch 22, the counselling service, provide targeted support for pupils with emotional issues. That’s just 3 schools. They’re in different parts in the country, with different pupils and different cultures - but they have some things in common. They’ve made mental health a priority. They’ve all taken the initiative in developing admirable services. Importance of commissioning But more than anything - they know their pupils. It’s sometimes easy, as an adult, to forget just how complex teenage life can be. Adults have their own worries of course: mortgages, bills, going grey, needing a holiday. But growing up is a rollercoaster of new experiences and hormones, as everyone tries to work out what they want to do in life - to work out who they are. These schools get that. You can see it in the services they provide: they are sensitive, targeted, effective. They understand who they’re for. And this, really, is the heart of the matter. We use this word, ‘commissioning’, to describe what these schools have done. Now most teenagers probably wouldn’t hear you out if you started talking about ‘strategic commissioning’ to them - and you could hardly blame them. But they’re the ones that will suffer if services fail them. If they didn’t join up when needed - if schools don’t talk to hospitals, if local authorities don’t talk to the voluntary sector - it’s young people who will slip through the cracks. Commissioning is really just a word to express what is actually quite a simple - but a profoundly important idea. It’s no more - and no less - than making services do the job they’re supposed to do, when they’re needed, where they’re needed. Good commissioning is the essential task. And it means 2 of our reforms are particularly important. Special educational needs reform First, we’re changing the code of practice for special educational needs which mentions mental health issues for the first time and will help make sure that they are properly identified. We think a pupil’s behaviour, for example, should be placed in its proper context. All children go through patches of bad behaviour, and all teachers know that life at home can show up in behaviour or results in the classroom. Now there are a range of ways to tackle that. It doesn’t help if children who are behaving badly to be automatically treated as having SEN . Indeed, that approach can sometimes prevent schools from recognising underlying issues properly and mean that children don’t get the support they really need. We want to change that. These proposals are out to consultation right now. If you haven’t already looked, please do. In fact, there are 3 consultations out: one for under-16s , one for 16 to 25s , and the full consultation . We care about what young people think about our reforms - they are for them, after all. So please do spread the word among children, just as much as among your colleagues. Joint commissioning And the second big reform we’re making is joint commissioning. This is one of the most important changes in the Children and Families Bill, currently making its way through Parliament - our plan to introduce joint commissioning across health, education and social care. It’s why we’ve funded BOND , which we’re here to discuss today. Schools have lots of contact time with pupils, but they fit into a wider network of local authorities, charities and other government services. Improving the capacity of the voluntary and community sector to provide services - and to show they work - is at the heart of BOND . I want to thank the BOND consortium for all their hard work, particularly YoungMinds for their dedication to the project - and their commitment to getting the best possible results. The numbers speak for themselves: 88 schools across 5 regions, supporting 95 charities, helping commissioners across 14 local authorities, working with 700 people from 440 organisations. Those are some pretty impressive stats. And they represent some extremely impressive stories. Like the Cambridgeshire BOND pilot. It helped identify gaps in local early intervention services for primary school children - which led directly to a new £98,000 contract to provide those services. And it spotted a specific in services for children and young people who self-harm. So the voluntary sector has designed a commissioning pathway with the council, specifically for self-harm services. Self-harm is, for obvious reasons, extremely delicate - one of the most complex issues for teenagers at risk, one of the most heart-breaking and difficult for parents to talk about, and one of the most subtle issues for health and education professionals to handle. That makes improving services - helping those young people - all the more essential. And that’s exactly what BOND has helped to do in Cambridgeshire. Or take Tees Valley, which you heard about from Emma this morning. That pilot brought new money in mental health. Hartlepool council plans to put £50,000 into voluntary sector mental health intervention services in schools. NHS Tees is providing £125,000, and the Clinical Commissioning Group has agreed a further £100,000 to further build the capability of voluntary organisation. That couldn’t capture the spirit of joint commissioning any better. Local government, schools, the NHS and the voluntary sector all working together and all making mental health a priority. It’s exactly what we want to see. Looking to the future As the BOND programme comes to an end, we’ll be reviewing what we can learn from it, and exploring how we can promote its findings - like the ACE-V tool. Every pilot has something interesting, that can spark ideas and prompt action elsewhere. Joint commissioning in Teeside, a leadership programme in Liverpool, new service design in Cambridge, resources for teachers in Staffordshire, relations between schools and mental health services in South West London. Each of these is a rich source of inspiration, beyond the walls of this conference, I hope. And they come at a good time. The Children and Families Bill creates a new context - and a new opportunity - for this work. With SEN reform at its heart, the new year will bring a new legal framework for mental health. And that, really, is just the start. What all this is about - BOND , our reforms, the whole thing - is making life better for young people. It’s about placing mental health on an equal footing with physical, about every young person getting the same good start in life. My sense is that there is a growing consensus for the need to tackle this head-on. That’s what we’re committed to, and what all our policies are designed to achieve. And I thank you all - and particularly YoungMinds - for your enthusiasm and support in translating it into reality."

/government/speeches/sarah-teather-to-daycare-trust-annual-conference,"Anand, can I thank you very much for inviting me today - it is a great pleasure to be here. And can I begin by offering my congratulations to Maggie Darling on her appointment as Chair. I’ve worked with Maggie before and I know she has been a long supporter of this organisation so I wish her well in what I know will be a demanding and challenging, but very exciting, time of work. As Anand said, this is your last conference before your 25th birthday and I do hope that you do feel extremely proud of the work that you have done over the last 25 years. But if I can add another thank you on top of the things that Anand said just a minute ago: I want to thank you for your help in working towards a good settlement in the Spending Review last month. Now, as Anand outlined just a few minutes ago, at a time of real difficulty in public finances, to get the good settlement that we did - the good settlement on Sure Start, the increased investment in the Early Years - was by no means inevitable. And it is really thanks to the campaigning work that the sector did over a long period of time to raise awareness of the importance of Early Years and arguing for the moral, the political and the economic reasons for investing in Early Years, is what made it easier for ministers such as myself to make those arguments inside government. So I want to say thank you for the work that you did. Without the work that you did there is absolutely no way I would be able to stand here today with the settlement that we have - so a huge thank you. But of course the challenge is to build on that, and to make sure that that investment counts. And walking away waving a promissory from the Treasury is a good start, but we’ve now got to live up to the expectation that we’ve made with the Treasury - and we’ve made our bid for Early Years. From the Government’s perspective, I hope that greater clarity about our objectives will help with that. In the past I think there have been many competing objectives around the importance of investing in Early Years. Why should we invest in Early Years? What’s it for? Is it about welfare to work? Is it about childcare? Is it about women’s equality? Well of course all of those things do matter but the Government has made a clear decision to prioritise child development, and we’ve done that because we see what a difference that can make in the long term around social justice and on social mobility. Successive governments have tried to tackle the issue of poverty and have spent billions trying to fix it. But this Government thinks the only way to sustainably make a difference on disadvantage is to focus on social mobility and on opportunity - trying to change life chances, not just moving people across an arbitrary income line. Disadvantage in Britain today is too often passed from one generation to another, like a genetic trait. The parents’ income predicts how well you do at school; how well you do at school predicts your income. And so we go round and round. And we have to find a way of breaking out of that devastating loop. We also know that the gaps between the rich and the poor set in long before children actually get to school. And we are absolutely determined to break that link. This Government thinks that your birth should not equal your fate, and critical to that is investing in the Early Years. That is why I announced the extension of the three- and four-year-old entitlement to 15 hours in the summer. And it’s why the Comprehensive Spending Review prioritised investment in disadvantaged two-year-olds. Now I announced this week that the Government intends to legislate to make sure it is a free entitlement for disadvantaged two-year-olds and make that an actuality by 2013. In the meantime, money will be available next year to continue to provide for two-year-olds at the current level. And after that, financial support will rise rapidly to £300 million by the end of the Comprehensive Spending Review period. Sure Start is also - absolutely - at the heart of what the Government wants to do around early intervention and tackling disadvantage. Now Anand spoke a few minutes ago about the decision to remove the ringfence on Sure Start. What we’ve done is put the money for Sure Start into a new grant called the Early Intervention Grant, because we want councils to think much more about early intervention and to prioritise early intervention across the piece, from Early Years, but also the work they do with families. But Sure Start children’s centres are going to be at the heart of what we do, and when we have the report through from Graham Allen - who’s doing a report for the Government on early intervention and best practice - we’re going to need Sure Start centres to deliver that work and deliver the best practice that Graham Allen advises on. But I want more diverse, more flexible centres - much more voluntary sector involvement as well. Which is why I announced also that we’re going to use the Localism Bill to try and drive forward that change so that voluntary sector organisations have the right to challenge local authorities so that they would put those services out to tender, and so that voluntary sector organisations might be much more involved in running centres - as well as, of course - involved in providing services from centres, which many already are. But I want to lift the burdens on children’s centres to allow them to be more responsive to local need. At the moment it doesn’t make sense for all children’s centres to provide full day care in disadvantaged areas if there is not the take up to make use of it. Money ends up being diverted from interventions that might otherwise make a real difference, such as family support, or co-financing extra speech and language therapy. So I can announce today that we will remove that requirement. However, we are still expecting centres to provide high-quality early education to meet local need. Some centres will want to go on providing full day care, but only if that demand is available locally, and I want them to be able to make that decision based on local need. We are expecting centres to tailor what they provide to their local area. Now in that context, if centres are not providing full day care, we don’t want to be as prescriptive as we have previously been in expecting them to employ both a QTS and an EYP. So we will remove that requirement. However, we hope that Sure Start children’s centres will want to play a leadership role in their area - driving forward the policy on Early Years and having good graduates in centres is vital to do that. The final announcement I want to make today is about the work of the Children’s Workforce and Development Council. The Government is committed to improving the quality of the Early Years workforce, which is at the heart of the reforms I’ve spoken about today and the reforms that we will speak about over the coming months. However we do want to free up resources for front-line staff, so we will be taking the work of this body back in to the Department. CDWC has done some fantastic work but we want to reduce the layers within government that the sector has to deal with. All of these changes have been about supporting the overriding ambition of child development - a principle that we feel is too important to ignore; a principle that recognises that while you can make the case for saying children are born equal in this country, they are not all born lucky. It’s up to us to load the dice in their favour. By reducing bureaucracy, by giving local authorities greater independence, by trusting Early Years professionals to do their job, and by freeing up more resources for the front line, we are in a far better position to do that. My thanks goes to the Daycare Trust, and the wider sector, for giving us that sense of direction and purpose - and for ensuring that the commitment to Early Years is a long-term one and will benefit children and families for many years to come. Thank you."

/guidance/pupil-premium-virtual-school-heads-responsibilities,"Virtual school heads ( VSHs ) are in charge of promoting the educational achievement of all the children looked after by the local authority they work for. VSHs are responsible for managing pupil premium funding for the children they look after and for allocating it to schools and alternative provision ( AP ) settings (these are places that provide education for children who can’t go to a mainstream school). VSHs are also responsible for managing the early years pupil premium ( EYPP ) . They’re in charge of giving the premium to the early years providers that educate looked-after children (children in local-authority care) who are taking up the free early education entitlement for 3- or 4-year-olds . Early years providers are any organisation that offers education for children aged under 5, including nurseries and childminders. You can find more information in our: pupil premium guide for schools and AP settings EYPP guide for local authorities These guides explain which children who are or have been in local-authority care attract the pupil premium and the EYPP . Responsibilities As VSH , you’re responsible for making sure your local authority has set up arrangements for allocating pupil premium and EYPP funding to benefit your looked-after children. You must: identify your local authority’s looked-after children let social care and EYPP colleagues in your local authority know which looked-after children are eligible for the pupil premium and the EYPP make sure that the method you choose for allocating and spending the funding is simple so that your looked-after children can benefit from the funding without delay make sure that schools, AP settings and early years providers spend their pupil premium funding for looked-after children to help meet the needs identified in the children’s personal education plans ( PEPs ) make sure that any pupil premium funding that you have not passed on to an educational setting or spent by 31 March is returned to DfE be able to demonstrate how the pupil premium and EYPP funding you are managing is raising the achievement of your looked-after children work with each looked-after child’s educational setting to agree how pupil premium funding will be spent to meet the needs identified in the child’s personal education plan ( PEP ) - this will usually involve working with a school’s designated teacher for looked-after children How to manage the funding Distribute the funding to schools or early years settings In most cases, you’ll give schools and early years providers the pupil premium or EYPP for every looked-after child in their care. Depending on the circumstances you can either: pass on the full amount of pupil premium or EYPP you receive for a particular child to their school or early years provider (in the case of school-age children, you will get £1,900 per looked-after child every year) pass on less than the full amount pass on more than the full amount You should make this decision by talking to the child’s school or early years provider. Ask them how they’ll use the funding to meet the child’s needs (which will be described in their PEP ). When to pool the funding You can pool some pupil premium or EYPP to fund activities that will benefit a group of or all of the authority’s looked-after children. For example, you could use the premium to fund training for a group of designated teachers across your authority. You could also pool a portion of the premium to run an activity that all the primary-aged looked-after children in your local authority can participate in. You can also suggest that a school or early years provider pools its pupil premium for looked-after children with the rest of its pupil premium funding. This would be to provide more complete support to all the disadvantaged children in the school or early years setting. How to spend funding you have not distributed to schools If you retain any pupil premium or EYPP funding centrally, don’t use the funding for services that your local authority is responsible for funding, such as support for foster carers, school uniforms or transport to get the child to school. However, you can use pupil premium or EYPP funding to pay for activities that will: improve the way you determine the learning targets in children’s PEPs , so that PEPs are always useful and relevant encourage looked-after children to be more involved and interested in their education For instance, one local authority is using some pupil premium funding to hire PEP champions. These champions help to make sure PEPs set clear targets so looked-after children get better results in school. Another VSH is using some pupil premium funding to train school staff in understanding how children build relationships and form attachments with trusted adults, as well as the impact this can have on their learning. Accountability Ofsted Ofsted’s framework for the inspection of services for looked-after children requires inspectors to ask you for an annual report. Your report should include: details of how you have managed the pupil premium and EYPP for looked-after children evidence of how your spending of the premiums has supported the achievement of the children looked after by your local authority Local authority Your accountability to more senior officials in your local authority will depend on the authority’s line management arrangements. Support and advice You should ask the finance team in your local authority about the best way of distributing funding to schools and early years providers. You can contact us if you need advice on managing pupil premium or EYPP funding for looked-after children. You can also talk to other VSHs to find out how other areas are managing the pupil premium and EYPP for looked-after children. [Contact:978]"
/government/news/overhaul-to-englands-school-building-programme,"(Updated 12 July 2010) Education Secretary Michael Gove today set out a complete overhaul of capital investment in England’s schools. Mr Gove said he was making tough, immediate decisions to help get the best value for money. Bringing an end to Building Schools for the Future programme (BSF), he said in the light of the public finances, it would have been irresponsible to carry on regardless with an inflexible, and needlessly complex programme. And he said it was right to set out a clear way forward for prudent future capital investment in education up to 2015, to flexibly target schools in the worst condition, cut red tape, and tackle urgent demand from rising birth-rates. Michael Gove discusses the Building Schools for the Future programme The Chancellor made clear in last month’s budget that existing overall public capital investment plans, put in place by the previous government, would remain with no further cuts. The key elements of today’s announcement are that: the government is launching a comprehensive review of all capital investment in schools, early years, colleges and sixth forms. Led by Sebastian James (Group Operations Director of DSG international plc), the review team includes Kevin Grace (Tesco Director of Property Services), Barry Quirk (Chief Executive of Lewisham), John Hood (former Vice-Chancellor of University of Oxford) and Sir John Egan (former Chief Executive of Jaguar and BAA) the review will guide future spending decisions over the next spending review period (from the financial year 2011 to 2012 to the financial year 2014 to 2015). It will look at how best to meet parental demand, make current design and procurement cost-effective and efficient, and overhaul how capital is allocated and targeted. the Department for Education is reducing its end-year flexibility (EYF) requirements by £1 billion to help ensure no additional borrowing this year. This is in line with the government’s plan to reduce the deficit, and the Treasury’s announcement today that departments have agreed to address unrealistic inherited spending commitments for the financial year 2010 to 2011, where funding was reliant on underspends through the EYF system or additional funding from the government’s reserve. The department expects to be able to manage most of this through better financial management and tighter controls. Because of the size of the reduction, however, the department will have to make £156.5 million savings from capital budgets where commitments are no longer affordable. The Secretary of State is also announcing today that he will be ending the £972,000 annual funding for the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment (CABE) design advice service associated with the BSF programme. Sebastian James, Group Operations Director of DSG International plc and chair of the review, said: I am delighted to be involved in this vital project and feel very passionately that we can build a schools infrastructure in Britain that is truly world class, while significantly reducing our spending. In my view, success in this review means that we will have found a way to have great schools for our children against a more measured investment backdrop. This has also been welcomed by educational organisations with experience of working through the current BSF process. Sir Bruce Liddington, Director General of E-Act said: The current BSF programme is very bureaucratic, slow and unwieldy and I would welcome a review. Aredi Pitsiaeli, Director of Business and Strategic Development at Oasis Community Learning said: We welcome the review of the BSF programme as to learn lessons from past experience in order to find a better way of working for the future can only be a good thing.

/government/speeches/edward-timpson-speaks-at-the-young-carers-conference,"It is a real pleasure to be here today. I am especially pleased to have the chance to express my deep appreciation for the extremely hard work that so many of you put in on a daily basis. I want to single out Jenny Frank, who is Programme Manager of The Children’s Society’s Include project and who is a tremendously helpful point of contact for the Department for Education. It is Jenny and her team, along with several key co-conspirators, that have organised and delivered these events all around the country. I understand that running these events has been a logistical nightmare requiring all their resourcefulness and ingenuity and the keeping of some fairly anti-social hours. They really have worked miracles on a tight budget to get us everywhere we needed to be so I would like to formally record my thanks for their efforts. The extraordinary dedication of young carers shows the very best of humanity. I know that you are looking for more from me than a pat on the back or a patronising “Well done you.” But I do want to begin by simply saying “Thank you.” Thank you for your participation at this and previous events, for speaking up on behalf of young carers across the country. Thank you for telling us about the sacrifices you constantly make; the lengths you go to in putting other people first; and the burdens you shoulder that would defeat many of us. I am looking forward to hearing from you very much indeed. Without your voice we can’t hope to know what your world is really like - or how we can help. Celebrating the Prevention Through Partnership Programme Today is a chance to look back on seventeen events that have been held over two years as part of the Prevention Through Partnership Programme. This has been a highly successful, concerted, joint effort to help local services improve the identification of and support for young carers and their families. Funded by the DfE and run by the Children’s Society, Prevention Through Partnership has brought together a whole host of interested parties. Local authorities; statutory agencies; the health, education and voluntary sectors; other charities; adult teams; early years, probation and youth-offending services; and - perhaps most importantly of all - young carers themselves. These events have given decision makers and practitioners space to think about what they have in place for young carers and their families, a chance to discuss how things could work better, and some copper-bottomed, evidence-based examples and tools to help deliver that change Although we have heard that there is plenty of good practice out there, it’s clear that there is still plenty more to do. So with that in mind I am delighted that we are able to keep this work going for a further two years. Inevitably we will have less money to spend than before but what will not be lost is a focus on the whole family and the importance of communication and cooperation between different organisations and sectors. Putting young carers first We sometimes hear rather too much, I think, about how children don’t know what’s good for them. But there is an important sense in which this may be true of young carers. Caring can be a very worthwhile thing to do - helping someone to develop useful skills and affording them an opportunity to do something meaningful for a person that they love. Yet carers of whatever age can, for the most noble of reasons, overlook their own needs. So it’s absolutely right, then, that the system should be there to protect them. Young carers must be able to live a full life. That certainly includes an education, but also all the other things that their peers take for granted, like having time to go out with friends. And it’s not only abused children who are sometimes forced to grow up sooner than they should. We need to stop that happening. Young carers must be protected from those aspects of caring that are inappropriate for a child and, wherever possible, helped with those tasks that all of us find difficult. Sorting out an electricity bill or speaking to health professionals about a parent’s condition are rarely straightforward tasks. The more that everyone involved in the system is alive to these issues, the better. I grew up in a family that fostered many children. Some of those who came to live with us had been taken into care because their parents had left caring duties entirely to their children. That is at the more extreme end of the spectrum, but the fact remains that being a young carer is always highly demanding. I don’t want those demands to become unbearable for anyone. Local authority adult and children’s services need to work closely together. Any assessment of how an adult is faring should include asking how the whole family is coping, and any concerns must be passed on and acted upon. Of course different local authorities face different challenges, but there are plenty of young carers in every part of the country. And whatever budgetary pressures local authorities face, and we know that they do, none of them can allow this to become a Cinderella service. Focused support works and schools have a key role We know that family-focused support works. A survey the DfE published in September 2011 found a significant improvement for nearly a third of families supported by the Young Carer Pathfinder projects. Families saw significant improvements in areas such as, housing, relationships between family members, child protection, inappropriate levels of caring, school attendance and anti-social behaviour. Schools have a key role too. They are well-placed to identify young carers at an early stage. I’m afraid I have zero sympathy for any teacher who thinks that their responsibility extends no further than educating their pupils during school hours. Any adult who has regular contact with a child should take a keen interest in their welfare. Schools cannot meet their obligation to support vulnerable children without being well-versed in this subject. And remember that this is not only a moral obligation but a statutory one as well. I was dismayed to learn that one young carer’s project that offered to come and talk to a school assembly about young carers had been assured by the head-teacher that “I have no young carers at my school.” Given that around 8 per cent of school-age children may be young carers, that is wildly improbable. In January 2011 the Children’s Society and ITV surveyed over 350 young carers. A fifth said they had been bullied because of their caring role and over half said that being a young carer had a negative effect on their schoolwork. There are many resources available to help deal with the challenges surrounding young carers, including a Department for Education online e-learning package for staff in schools. The Prevention Through Partnership Programme has shared this - and done much more besides - brilliantly. The feedback from these events has been overwhelmingly positive. So I’d also like to take a second here to acknowledge the excellent work done by Carers Trust as part of our other young carers grant-funded work in collecting, collating and sharing so many best practice examples. New contract The Children’s Society and Carers Trust have played a vital part in helping local services think about how they can design, commission and deliver services in a young carer-friendly way. We are already starting to see the results of this work and uncover some existing good practice, for example: Stockton Council and NHS Stockton-on-Tees working together to produce a joint carers strategy; Hampshire’s practice guidance for adult and children’s services in supporting young carers within a whole-family working model; and Norfolk County Council involving their local young carers in the commissioning process. So I am delighted to be able to announce today that a new contract worth £1.2 million over the next two years has been awarded to Carers Trust and the Children’s Society to continue this good work. Make no mistake - this constitutes a big vote of confidence in you. Thank you."
/government/publications/childcare-sufficiency-and-sustainability-in-disadvantaged-areas,"Childcare providers in disadvantaged areas are more susceptible to financial difficulties, because of fewer parents using childcare. As a result they are more financially vulnerable than providers in other more affluent areas. Childcare providers in disadvantaged areas face challenges in terms of remaining sustainable and improving quality. Despite the apparent surplus of childcare places, parents in disadvantaged families are more likely to report a lack of places at local providers as an obstacle to taking up childcare. This perception is one of the reasons that the children who the government most wants to benefit from childcare and early education (Families in the Foundation Years, DfE and Child Poverty Strategy) are currently least likely to access early education. As part of the Fairness Premium announced by the coalition government, from September 2013, the least advantaged two-year-olds will be entitled to 15 hours of free early education. For this policy to be successful there will need to be enough places available. The purpose of this project was to: explore how successful local authorities feel that they have been in securing the sustainability of childcare places in disadvantaged areas; examine the challenges local authorities and childcare providers face in providing sustainable childcare, and what factors explain sustainable provision of places or otherwise and explore if more support is needed for local authorities to ensure there are."
/government/speeches/edward-timpson-talks-about-special-educational-needs-reforms,"Thanks Alan [Wood, President of ADCS and Director of Children’s Services at Hackney Council]. It’s a pleasure to be back here with you again this year in this magnificent Edwardian baroque Mancunian venue. Congratulations, once again Alan, on your appointment. And a big thanks for the work you’ve done so far to help us on issues like Doncaster and Birmingham. It’s recognition also, I think of how much you bring to the role, not least, of course, dare I say, in giving more airtime to your experience of transforming education and children’s services in Hackney. So I’m very much looking forward to continuing to work with you and the ADCS in the coming months. And I echo what has been said: that ADCS is an important and significant organisation whose support and challenge I’ve greatly valued, and will continue to do so. And as well as drawing on your own strengths and passion, Alan, I know that you’ll want to build on Andrew Webb’s [previous President of ADCS ] excellent work over the past year. And I want to say how much personally I’ve appreciated the dedication and leadership Andrew has shown, particularly on adoption - something particularly close to my heart - and family justice. And also in his work with my department and Cafcass in developing a social work evidence template, as endorsed by the Family Justice Board. I think this is going to be a really important tool in our continued drive to reduce delays and ensure that our family courts work better for vulnerable children. It’s good to see the sector taking the lead on this. So I wish Andrew the very best as he continues his important work in Stockport and beyond. Also I want to add thanks to CYPNow who I think have provided fair, open reporting and critique of our work in central and local government with children and families. Now, I know that many of you’ll be expecting me to focus on children’s services and social work. And it’s true that there’ve been some important improvements, which are often overlooked, as well as developments; most notably, the recent move to give local authorities the freedom to delegate social care functions to mutual, community interest companies and other not-for-profit organisations. It’s no secret that there were some concerns that these freedoms could open the door to profiteering by the private sector. We listened to those views and I believe we’ve struck a good balance - between giving you the same freedom as we give other professionals in health and education, to innovate and raise standards, whilst ensuring that the same safeguards and accountabilities apply. Of course, how - and even if - councils use these freedoms is entirely in their hands. But I’m in no doubt that there’s a fantastic opportunity here to increase the capacity of the system, as well as the diversity and quality of services - something I know your president has also recognised and supported. So, wherever possible, I urge you to grab it with both hands and make it work for you in your pursuit of excellence in services for children. But innovation doesn’t have to involve delivering services outside the local authority. As Alan said, the new children’s social care innovation programme is looking to support a variety of approaches. Just earlier this week you will be aware that I announced the first full award from the programme of £4 million to the London triborough to enable them to completely redesign how they deliver children’s social care from within and from top to bottom, so that professionals can spend more time with children and families and so practice is rooted in greater expertise and evidence. As one manager there commented last week, “We’re simply thrilled. It’s the first time ever that government has given us money and really allowed us to think for ourselves”. So I encourage you all to come forward with ideas that break new ground and help us do better. That’s what in reality innovation means, and it’s an opportunity for the sector, not a threat. So it’s pleasing that other local authorities are working with us on designing a specialist social work practice specialising in FGM and on setting up third party organisations like mutuals to deliver more effective services. The mutual model has proven successful right across the range of public services; raising productivity and cutting costs whilst fostering innovation and improving quality for service users. And it’s a model that has the potential to play a central role in this sector too. But these freedoms and opportunities for innovation are only a part of our push to find new and better ways to serve our most vulnerable children. They also include our reforms to special educational needs ( SEN ), shaped with the ADCS . And with their introduction fast approaching, that’s what I want to concentrate on today. These reforms represent big changes for families who only ask for what we all expect for our own children - support to help them develop and thrive. Support that fits in with their needs and not the other way around. Support that’s as ambitious for their child as we are for other children. A system that sees the child and not the label. And that’s exactly what our reforms are all about. For too long, families who face big enough challenges already have also found themselves facing - as one mother put it - “an unending battle” with a system that’s supposed to be on their side. Like you, I want to change that experience for families. To take us from a system that, despite best efforts, has simply become too complex, fractured and adversarial to one that’s clearer, more joined up and much more focused on children achieving their best. Which means raising our ambitions much higher - and putting young people and their parents firmly in the driving seat. The changes we’re making do just that - whether through the new Education, Health and Care ( EHC ) plans; through the local offer outlining what support is available; or through the requirement for services to co-operate more closely, with a new duty on health to work with local authorities to ensure that any health support that’s agreed in an EHC plan is delivered - even if that means commissioning it specifically. It’s a radical overhaul that breaks down artificial barriers, and that champions children with SEN as never before from birth right through to adulthood. Yes, these are big changes for families. And big changes for all of us who support them - particularly for those of you on the ground. And I do appreciate that it’s easy to make promises from on high when those on frontline are the ones who have to deliver. Which is why I’m determined to do all I can to help you make the new system a success. As you know, the changes have now been enshrined in the Children and Families Act and the underpinning Code of Practice is currently going through its final stages in Parliament. But this is very much the beginning, not the end of the work that needs to be done. We all know that the real graft, the effort that ultimately turns lives around, doesn’t happen in Parliament, but in county offices, classrooms, GP surgeries, nurseries, colleges, playgrounds, not to mention family homes. Because the truth is, that if it’s to have a real impact, a change in law must go hand in hand with a change in culture - a long-term change that gives much greater priority to children and young people with SEN . That sees us ‘working with’, not ‘doing to’. These aren’t my words. They’re the words of the local authorities I met last week, many of whom are already driving some really excellent practice - and not just in pathfinder areas, but in other councils too. They told me that the new arrangements are freeing them to work with parents as they’ve always wanted to - parents who, having been through the EHC assessment and planning process, are also reporting really positive experiences that focus on their children’s strengths rather than their limits. So we can see that councils can - and are - making these reforms work and, as a consequence, making a tangible difference. And I hope you’ll be encouraged and energised , even inspired by their example as you get ready for roll-out in little over a month’s time. To that end, I know from my own conversations and visits in recent weeks that many of you have been working hard and committing extra, valuable resources in order to prepare, and I want to say how grateful I am for all your efforts so far. And the good news is that 95% of councils have told us they’re on track for September and can manage the changes. For authorities who are further behind the curve, I’ve made it my business personally to follow up on their progress. I hope that’s a sign of how important the government considers these reforms to be and our determination to see them improve things on the ground. Because we clearly all want families to be able to transfer smoothly to the new system and take full advantage of everything it has to offer. And we’ve listened to you to ensure that this transfer happens at a manageable pace over the next 3-and-a-half years. So while we’re pressing the button in September, we’re not talking about an overnight switch. And we expect that different councils of different sizes and starting points will take different approaches to delivery. For some, these aren’t such big changes. In Rochdale, for example, health and social care are already well integrated, and joint commissioning is also well developed in Kent and Wigan. And in West Sussex and Hartlepool, we can see that personal budgets are doing their bit to really improve the continuity of care between home and school. But be that as it may, we know that introducing these changes is a challenge - which is why we’re providing support throughout. It’s why I recently announced an extra £45.2 million of funding in 2014 to 2015 and indicative funding of £31.7 million in 2015 to 2016 to help councils with implementation. That’s on top of the £70 million SEN Reform Grant that councils can use, with no ring fencing, to work with health and others to deliver these changes. And I’m also working closely with Dr Dan Poulter, my ministerial colleague at the Department of Health, to ensure that information and advice on implementation is joined-up across health and social care. On top of that, we’ve also extended the pathfinder champion programme until March 2015, so that local areas can easily draw on lessons from those testing the reforms across 31 local authorities. And as well as listening to you, we’ve also been listening to parents and young people and taking on board their advice about how we can make the system better. Families told us that they wanted to be more involved in shaping the support they receive. And we can see that the reforms are helping them do just that. In Greenwich, families are using short films, written reports and even music about each child to bring their EHC plans to life on secure websites. Parents give professionals working with them access to these personalised sites - sites which also allow professionals to regularly post updates and other useful information. One of the special schools in the area has taken this a step further, and incorporated this imaginative approach into their curriculum. A terrific example of the kind of innovation and excellence that these reforms are unleashing - and it’s not just restricted to areas testing the reforms. Wolverhampton isn’t a pathfinder, but has, nevertheless, involved young people and their parents, early on, and got them working in partnership with different agencies to produce a draft local offer and trial an integrated assessment approach. The result? EHC plans being delivered more quickly and families reporting better experiences. As one parent put it, “The process was smooth and easy and felt very personal to us as a family”. That’s exactly what I want every parent to be able to say. In Cheadle, the Seashell Trust is bringing professionals from different agencies together in one place to carry out assessments - which is better for them and better for the families in their care. I was able to visit the Trust recently and was really impressed by what I saw. And we can see personal budgets stimulating innovation in the SE7 area as they shift the focus from the mechanics of provision to the potential of each young person. One parent told us that having a personal budget “…has made us think differently about how we might approach his longer-term care and support needs and the role we could play in this, to the extent that we are looking into setting up a parent-led residential care service for him and other young adults as a long-term venture”. Now, we often talk about empowering families and putting them at the centre of services. I think this is what it looks like. But there’s, of course, more to do. Families have consistently told us - and all of you - over the years how hard they’ve found it to get information, to deal with different agencies, to find their way through the system. That’s why we’re putting £30 million into recruiting and training independent supporters to help families in the transition to the new system, which are intended to also help you. And I’m optimistic that these supporters and the generally more collaborative thrust of the new system will not only help put children’s needs first, but improve relationships between parents and professionals - and reduce the conflict that’s all too prevalent in the current set-up. Indeed, developing good links with parents and doing all you can to involve them, now and in the long term, is utterly vital to the cultural shift that’s needed to make these reforms a success; to helping families understand what the changes mean for them and to managing expectations. Change, inevitably, can be a rather bumpy ride, so investing in these relationships now will pay dividends in the months and years to come. So I urge you to make them a real priority. Contact all your families with an identified child with SEND and make sure they know what will be happening come September. Equally, early years settings, schools and colleges also need to get young people and parents on board - especially when it comes to working with councils to develop the local offer and their own school offer. And I’m also keen to see schools and local authorities joining up with health wherever possible so that support can be provided earlier. In planning ahead, the Code - which is firmly based on best practice - is a good guide, particularly as regards to greater integration with health and education. As you know, this will kick in at all levels. I also want to be clear that we don’t expect you to have everything done and dusted on day one. This is a marathon, not a sprint. There are, of course, certain things that you must have in place for September - information and advice, the local offer and the capacity to assess those wanting a new EHC plan. Others, like joint commissioning and the offer for young offenders, will take longer to develop. Because, as I said before, these are undoubtedly changes on a large scale that come with big challenges, but also - we shouldn’t forget - a big opportunity - the biggest for a generation to change the lives of some of our most disadvantaged children. And with over 1.5 million children and young people relying on our SEN provision in just our schools, I accept that it won’t all be plain sailing. But, be in no doubt, we are behind you all the way; offering support from our expert advisers or from Mott McDonald, putting money behind the new system, monitoring closely how it works. So I urge you to seize this chance to really raise our game for these young people. To go as far and fast as you can to help them tap into their unique talents. To support them to aspire and achieve at school, at work and as happy, fulfilled adults. To do the job you came into the profession to do - the very best for those in your care. This is what our drive for innovation in this and other areas is all about. Not change for its own sake. Not ideology. All I’m interested in, and what drives me, is what works to provide better support and better prospects for vulnerable children. And no-one has a keener understanding of what this means than the young people themselves and their parents. Something that’s been driven home for me, time and time again, not only on visits to schools and colleges, but also through the invaluable advice that I receive from EPIC , a group of very bright, articulate young people with special educational needs and disabilities. They remind me what really matters and why we’re all doing this - and what an incredible difference we can make to their lives when we get it right. So do take every opportunity to reach out to families as you implement these changes - you won’t regret it. So can I thank you, once again, for the hard work and commitment that all of you here and beyond have put in so far. The wider pressures you’re under are not lost on me either. I want you all to succeed. I believe we’re on track, and I’m confident that by continuing to work together, we can ensure that there are no limits to what children with SEN - indeed all children who need your support - can achieve. Thank you."

/government/speeches/nick-gibb-to-the-association-of-teachers-and-lecturers-2011-conference,"Thank you, Mary for that introduction. It’s a real pleasure to be here. I’ve waited many years to have the opportunity of speaking at the annual ATL conference. Having shadowed the schools minister post for 5 years in opposition, I don’t think I’ve ever been invited before but, as they say, good things come to those who wait. As part of my job I regularly meet Mary Bousted and other union leaders. When I saw Mary a few weeks ago I asked her what to expect at this conference. She was very honest. She said it would probably be challenging. She said the delegates would speak their minds. But she said that was because her members are dedicated professionals who take great pride in what they do. I see this whenever I visit schools. During my five years as the Shadow Minister for Schools, I visited over 200 schools and, as a Minister, I try to continue to visit as many schools as I can. One school I visited recently was Kingsford Community School in Newham. It’s a Confucius School, so it teaches Mandarin and I had the chance to sit in on a lesson with a Year 9 class. Given how difficult the language is to learn, I was astonished at how well the pupils could read and speak Mandarin. But after just a few minutes in that classroom, it was apparent why. It was the brilliant teacher who commanded the whole class’s attention superbly and instilled a deep love of the language in the pupils. This dedication was clear again earlier today in the hour I spent with a group of delegates. If I said that that we’d agreed on everything, there would probably be a few eyebrows raised - followed by several hundred requests for a list of the people in the room. Suffice to say, we didn’t agree on everything - but I do believe that we agree on more than we disagree and we all agree on the importance of education to the individual child and to the country as a whole. I think being Minister of State for Schools is one of the best jobs in Government, because, as someone who went into politics to improve people’s lives, I’m convinced that whatever their background nothing is more important than a child’s education. For children from the poorest backgrounds in particular, education is the only route out of poverty. One of the overarching objectives of this Government is to close the attainment gap between those from wealthier and poorer backgrounds, an ambition that I know is shared by the ATL. As the ATL survey released last week showed, nearly 80 per cent of teachers have students living in poverty. Four in 10 say that poverty has increased over the last three years. And 86 per cent say it is having a negative impact because their pupils are coming to school tired, hungry or lacking on confidence. As so, despite the hard work of teachers, it is still the case that the least likely to succeed are those children from the most disadvantaged backgrounds. Children from poorer homes start behind their wealthier contemporaries when they arrive at school. At age five, those children living in poverty are around eight months behind their peers. The achievement gap then becomes entrenched during primary school. At Key Stage 2, 25 per cent of children from poorer backgrounds fail to meet the expected level, compared to just three per cent from more affluent backgrounds. And it then stubbornly persists through secondary school. Only one in five young people from the poorest families achieve five GCSEs at grades A* to C including English and maths, compared with three-quarters from the richest families. The odds are even worse for children in care - just one in seven reach that basic benchmark. And of course, it is not just about qualifications. It’s the prospect of unemployment or a low-paid job, poor health, generational cycles of poverty and a greater likelihood of getting into trouble that really brings home the importance of a good education. The same mission drives us in government - and in Michael Gove, we have an Education Secretary whose own upbringing ignited a burning passion to extend better opportunities to the most vulnerable children. That is why we’re spending more in the vital early years and cutting the bureaucracy associated with the EYFS so children get a better start in life. It’s why we’re spending an additional £2.5 billion on the pupil premium that will mean the poorest pupils get the extra help and support they need. And we’d like to do more. But whichever political party came into office at the election it would have faced the challenge of tackling the economic consequences of a spiralling budget deficit. A deficit in which we were spending £156 billion more than we were receiving in income. And an accumulated debt that was costing £120 million in interest each and every day - enough to build 10 new primary schools, every single day. The Office for Budget Responsibility reports that without any further action to tackle the deficit, interest payments would rise to a staggering £67 billion a year by 2014-15 - that’s almost two years’ total spending on schools; twice what we spend on the salaries of every teacher in England, twice what we spend running every state school in the country - just to pay the interest on the debt. And that £156 billion budget deficit, had we not taken measures to address it, would have resulted in the same financial crises that have devastated Greece, Ireland and Portugal. And in the Department for Education we have had to make some very difficult decisions that we would not otherwise have wanted to make in order to help tackle that deficit. But I am pleased that we have managed to protect - at least in cash per pupil terms - spending on schools. I recognise that even this means difficult decisions for schools but in the context of cuts in spending in other Government departments I am proud of the settlement that Michael Gove negotiated with the Treasury. And I am pleased that we have been able to honour the third year of the teachers’ pay deal agreed before the election. I know the pay freeze we’ve had to impose beyond that isn’t popular but it’s a freeze that applies right across the public sector and it doesn’t include increments or pay rises due to promotion. Our priority is to be as fair as possible to all public sector workers and the freeze is helping to maintain the number of teaching posts. At the same time, we are also making the funding system for schools fairer and more transparent. It’s just not right that similar schools in different parts of the country receive, in some cases, vastly different amounts of money. But while we are doing the best we can with the finances we have available to us, by far our biggest asset is the people working in our schools. I’m sure that many teachers have been watching Jamie’s Dream School on Channel 4 with a combination of intrigue, horror and glee as celebrities have tried their hand at teaching a group of pretty difficult young people. There are some other valuable insights from watching a renowned historian like David Starkey, at least initially, struggle to convey his passion and expertise to his class. What the programme demonstrated so vividly is that good teachers not only need good subject knowledge, they also need to be able to communicate that passion, they need an understanding of how young people learn and they need to know their pupils. And the most important thing that the programme did was prove why teachers deserve so much thanks and respect for what they do, as well as why teaching should be revered alongside the most esteemed and highly skilled professions. But, despite this, it’s also true that teachers haven’t been afforded the trust and respect they deserve. And consequently, I believe more needs to be done to raise the professional status of teachers, something this Government is committed to helping to deliver. Over the past decade, there has been ream after ream of guidance issued to schools and law after law passed about education. But for every step forward, it has been a case of three steps backwards as yet more targets and responsibilities have been heaped upon teachers. There has been nothing short of a perpetual revolution inflicted on schools, which we have to bring to an end if teaching is to become the kind of prestigious profession we want it to be. That is why we are so determined to cut back on all unnecessary burdens and bureaucracy. We’re removing those onerous duties. We’ve scrapped the National Strategies. Our review of the National Curriculum has the express aim of reducing prescription about how to teach. Through the measures in our Education Bill, we’re refocusing Ofsted and we’re cutting back on back-office functions - including by getting rid of the GTC. And just as teachers have the responsibility for delivering high standards, so we too as ministers will no longer hide behind arms-length bodies like the QCDA. Instead, we’re taking responsibility by bringing essential functions back into the Department where we can be held properly accountable for the decisions made. Of course, there are areas where teachers need strong powers. Tackling bad behaviour is one of the toughest parts of a teacher’s job. I can also understand why teachers might feel that the system - and Government - hasn’t been on their side in the past. Our Education Bill will ensure that the pendulum, which has swung too far away from teachers in recent years, moves back in their favour by ensuring teachers have clear powers to discipline pupils and maintain order in the classroom. Just as importantly, it makes clear that we are backing head teachers and teachers - but that we expect all those in leadership positions to stay in touch with what is going in their classrooms and to back teachers too. And perhaps most importantly of all, ensuring teachers get proper protection from false and malicious allegations that are not only hugely damaging, but which can blight careers and lives. We also believe that professionals should have access to more and better continuous professional development. As Mary often says, teaching is a vocation and teachers need the highest possible skills. I can think of no one better qualified to lead a discussion with Ministers and with professional associations about the role and future of CPD, which is what Michael Gove and I have asked her to do next month. Teachers are the intellectual guardians of the nation and keeping their knowledge of their subjects up to date - whether it’s theoretical physics or English literature - is a vital part of being a good teacher. In the White Paper, we made a commitment to introduce a new Scholarship Fund. It hasn’t attracted much attention so far but our intention is that it will enable a number of teachers every year to study for post-graduate qualifications or other equally rigorous subject-based professional development that will benefit them and their careers. The ATL has long championed teachers improving their professional skills by observing other teachers. We agree that it is one of the best ways to improve teaching practice and to allow teachers to become better professionals. That is why we intend to reform teacher training so that, alongside thorough initial training, more time is spent in the classroom. It’s also why new centres of excellence in teaching practice - teaching schools - are being established. Modelled on teaching hospitals, they will allow new and experienced teachers to learn and develop their professional skills throughout their careers. But this doesn’t mean the end of university initial teacher training - as the country needs about 35,000 new teachers each year there will always be a major role for universities in preparing teachers for the profession. And in giving schools more autonomy some have claimed that we want to set schools free to go it alone. But by removing needless bureaucracy from schools and by encouraging school-led professional development, we believe schools can strengthen the bonds that exist between them and allow for more opportunities for teachers and schools to collaborate with each other. So, more freedom, more and better professional development, and more collaboration. All of these are essential to enabling teachers to improve their own effectiveness and, in turn, to improve the effectiveness of their schools. Because there is nothing more inspirational or memorable than being on the receiving end of great teaching. I remember one teacher from my own school days, Mr Rogers, or Brian as we called him - it was after all the mid-70s - who taught me A-level economics. He was himself only recently out of university and, despite his own left-of-centre politics, taught me economics so thoroughly that it gave me a genuine understanding of how economics works and turned me into a confirmed economic liberal. I owe him a huge debt of gratitude, but as I turned 50 recently, it’s horrifying to think that that young teacher must now be contemplating retirement. The issue of teacher pensions is one that is exercising the minds of teachers, teacher unions and the Government. As well as the huge pressures on public spending as a result of the Budget deficit, there are also long term pressures on all pension funds - both public sector and private - as a result of longer life expectancy and reduced financial returns on pension capital. We asked Lord Hutton to look at public sector pensions because of his experience as a Cabinet Minister in the last Labour Government and also because of his unparalleled commitment to public service values. In his report, Lord Hutton underlined the importance of continuing to provide high quality pension schemes to essential public service workers like teachers, whilst ensuring that current and future generations of public servants can also be rewarded for their hard work with a fair but affordable pension. We have already been clear that we don’t want to see a race to the bottom in pension provision - and that public service pensions should remain a gold standard. A good pension has long been an important part of the overall reward package that teachers expect. Our priority is to ensure that continues to be the case. Opt out rates from the Teachers Pension Scheme are extremely low and we want to keep them that way. But we won’t be able to achieve all of this if we ignore the realities of the cost pressures that all pension schemes are facing as life expectancy increases. The combination of more teacher pensioners and the increase in their life expectancy has meant that the cost of teachers’ pensions increases every year. In 2005/06, the cost of paying teachers’ pensions was around £5 billion. By 2015/16, the cost is forecast to rise to almost £10 billion. This is why long term reform of public service schemes is needed - and why teachers and other public service scheme members are being asked to pay a higher pension contribution from April 2012. From the start, the Government has made its commitment to protecting accrued rights absolutely clear. All the benefits that have been built up in a teacher’s pension will not be affected by any reforms recommended by Hutton. This means there is absolutely nothing to be gained by teachers seeking to retire earlier than they have planned. The Government has accepted Lord Hutton’s recommendations as the basis for discussions with all the trades unions. There have already been some constructive discussions between the TUC and the Government. The aim is to agree a package of principles for pensions reform by the end of June. I fully understand the strength of feeling here in this room - but I strongly urge the ATL to wait for the outcome of those discussions before deciding on whether to take further action. In preparing for this conference I looked back at the speech that Mary made last year. There was one phrase that really stuck in my mind. And it was this: “It’s the teachers, stupid.” I’m not sure who the “stupid” was directed at. I can only guess…… But she was right. We have to attach the highest possible importance to teachers and the teaching profession. That’s why our White Paper is called The Importance of Teaching. Its aim is to help teachers to be better professionals by reducing bureaucracy, improving professional development and supporting teachers and head teachers to maintain high standards of behaviour. And the reason why is because that is the only way that we can close the attainment gap between those from poorer and wealthier backgrounds. Whatever our differences on particular policy areas, I know that we are united in that aim. I’ve enjoyed working with Mary and with Martin over the last 11 months - and I look forward to a fruitful and constructive dialogue with the ATL in the months and years ahead. Thank you."

/government/speeches/michael-gove-at-the-national-college-annual-conference,"Thank you Steve for that introduction and thank you for all the great work you and the College have done over the past year. Can I also take this opportunity to thank Steve’s tireless deputy Toby Salt - who is about to take up a new challenge as Chief Executive of the Ormiston Academy chain - and Andy Buck, who has done a brilliant job in establishing Teaching Schools - who is going to work for ULT? It turns out that a downside of devolving power from the centre is that is creates great career opportunities for some of our best people. But I think that’s a price worth paying….. Those of you who have heard me speak before are probably expecting a brief tour around the educational policies of those countries that dominate the OECD’s PISA league table. And it’s true we have looked all over the world in developing our policies. Our curriculum reforms were inspired by the high expectations for all children in Singapore and Hong Kong. The success of Finland and South Korea has informed our focus on getting more of our very best graduates into teaching. The example of charter schools in New Orleans and New York - which have transformed the life chances of poorer children in those cities - have been critical in developing free school policy. London But while I’ve been inspired by Singapore, Finland and New Orleans another success story has perhaps had an even greater influence on my thinking. And it’s one that’s closer to home. London. Until 2004 London always underperformed the rest of the country in exams. In the seventies and eighties inner London schools were seen by many as a by-word for failure. While some were, in fact, doing well in difficult circumstances there were serious problems. Poor behaviour was endemic, aspiration was low, life chances were stunted. But over the last few decades there has been a transformation. The difference between London and the rest of the country may not seem that great at first glance. 62 per cent of children achieve five good GCSEs with English and Maths compared with 58 per cent nationally. Dig a little deeper, though, and there are some startling results. Across the country just 35 per cent of children on free school meals achieve five good GCSEs with English and Maths - a scandalously low figure - but in inner-London 52 per cent meet it - just a few points off the average for all children. And this gap between the achievement of children in the capital and elsewhere exists for all ethnic groups and all income bands. For instance almost half of London’s poorest white pupils get five good GCSEs with English and Maths compared with 37 per cent nationally. Nor has the success been patchy - there have been big improvements across the capital. There is now just one London secondary school below the floor standard. So how has this happened? Of course London has many advantages - it is a dynamic city with a fantastic cultural heritage. It benefits from a diverse mix of, often highly aspirational, communities. As the centre of so many professions - politics, media, the law - it is much easier to identify role models for young people than in other parts of the country. But those things have been true for many years and London’s success is a more recent phenomenon. What’s really made the difference is that London has been the laboratory for educational reform over the past decade. The last Government launched the London Challenge in 2003. There were several elements to this but the three most important were: Sponsored Academies The use of outstanding schools to mentor others A focus on improving the quality of teaching - especially through Teach First Each of these strands has had a profound effect on performance and on my thinking. In each case this Government has learnt the lessons and is spreading the benefits of these reforms across the rest of the country. The sponsored academy revolution began in London. Until 2010 there were more in London than the rest of the country put together - and there are still more than in any other region. Nearly all of them have seen massive improvements from their predecessor school - given a new lease of life by a committed sponsor and the independence to innovate. But some in particular have been so incredibly successful that they’ve had a transformative impact on expectations in their area. There are a small number of schools where children on free school meals both represent more than a third of all pupils and achieve above the national average. These are the jewels in the crown of the state education system - a standing rebuke to everyone who claims poorer children are destined to do worse than others. And when you look for them across London you start to see a pattern. In Hackney there is one such school. It won’t surprise anyone to learn that it’s Mossbourne Academy. In Southwark there are two - ARK Walworth Academy and Harris Bermondsey Academy. In Westminster there are three - Pimlico Academy, Paddington ULT Academy and one non-academy: St. Marylebone Church of England School. In each of these local authorities the incredible performance of new sponsored academies has acted as a spur to others. In Southwark the percentage of free school meal children achieving five good GCSE with English and Maths has increased by 23 percentage points in 4 years; in Westminster 18 percentage points; in Hackney by 15. Since the election this Government - inspired by these successes - has turbo-charged the sponsored academy programme. By this September we will have increased the number we inherited by well over 100 per cent. And, crucially, we have expanded the programme into primary schools - more than 200 have now been brokered and 34 are already open. I know this has been one of our more controversial reforms - some of the usual suspects have sought to protect underperforming schools from necessary change. But it seems deeply irresponsible to me to allow schools to fail year after year when organisations, like Harris, that have proven their ability to turn round schools time and time again are willing to help. Academies, though, are only part of what made the London Challenge successful. The leadership strand of the programme focused on identifying “system leaders” to support weaker schools. This proved extremely successful. Schools in Tower Hamlets and Newham - like Swanlea and Rokeby - have been amongst the fastest improvers in recent years - and have done so by working closely with each other to drive up standards. The legacy of this success is widespread support for system leadership as the best method of school improvement. As former chief inspector Christine Gilbert put it in a recent speech: “we’ve reached a tipping point in favour of schools, school leaders, and teachers themselves, as the primary drivers of systemic improvement”. That is reflected both in the National Leader of Education programme - which is being massively expanded by this Government - as well as the great work being done by good and outstanding schools that have converted to academy status to help others. Indeed one of the Tower Hamlets’ schools originally identified as requiring support under the London Challenge - Bethnal Green Technology College - converted to academy status as an outstanding school in January this year and is, as a condition of that status, supporting Dartford Technology College, a school currently in special measures. Increasingly the very best schools are going beyond ad hoc support for weaker schools and establishing their own chains and federations - in the same way Harris, Haberdashers and John Cabot City Technology Colleges did in the early years of the academy programme. 85 outstanding schools are now signed up as academy sponsors. The third key strand of the London Challenge was a focus on increasing the number of outstanding teachers through professional development and recruitment of the best graduates via Teach First - which was in its first few years a predominantly London centred programme. Of the 1,000 Teach First trainees who completed training under the last Government over three-quarters were based in a London school. While these 750 plus teachers represent a small percentage of the London workforce they have had a disproportionate impact. It is notable that the schools I mentioned earlier that help children on free school meals outperform the average have all relied heavily on Teach First in their recruitment. Indeed many Teach Firsters have already reached leadership positions in these schools and others like them. They are often young people who would not have considered teaching without the additional prestige of Teach First, or the opportunity to start working in a challenging school straight away, but who have now decided to commit their lives to helping some of the most disadvantaged children in our society match - or supersede - their own achievements. The Importance of teaching Their success emphasises one of the key messages of international research over the past few years: no education system can outperform its teachers and the most successful jurisdictions, though they may differ hugely in other aspects, share a focus on recruiting the very best graduates and training them in outstanding institutions. Under this Government Teach First have been given the funding to grow in commensurate proportion to their ambitions. By the end of this Parliament they plan to train 1,500 graduates a year; three times as many as they were doing at the beginning. They have developed a bespoke primary programme and expanded to all parts of the country. But we are not just growing Teach First itself we are also applying the key lessons of that programme to the whole teacher training system. And how we’re doing that is what I want to focus on today. Some changes we’ve already made. One lesson from Teach First, as well as of PISA, is the importance of attracting the best graduates. So we have introduced bursaries of up to £20,000 to attract the very best science and maths graduates. And we have raised the bar for potential trainees - they now need at least a second class degree to receive a bursary - to signal to undergraduates the intellectual rigour required to become a teacher. We know that a big reason for Teach First’s success in recruiting hundreds of graduates from our best universities is the sense of prestige attached to a programme badged as elite. We now need to extend that sense of prestige to teaching as a whole. As a result of these changes we have already seen a 12 per cent increase in the proportion of candidates with a 2:1 or first class degree accepted on to maths, physics, chemistry and modern foreign languages teacher training courses. In physics - traditionally the hardest subject to recruit for - there has been an incredible 29 per cent rise in the proportion of graduates with a good degree accepted on to courses. And attitudes are changing too. In their annual survey of final year undergraduates the Teaching Agency found that: 81 per cent agreed that teaching had real status and kudos - up 4 per cent since 2010. 72 per cent thought their friends and family would react positively to them becoming a teacher - up 6 per cent since 2010. And, encouragingly, 71 per cent thought the image of teaching is improving. Schools at the heart of teaching training But it’s not just about ensuring that we recruit the very best talent available. We also need to make sure that our very best educators are at the heart of training each new generation of teachers. And the best vehicle for doing this is something else that started in London as part of the Challenge - the Teaching School - pioneered by George Berwick the visionary headteacher of Ravens Wood School. There were just a handful of Teaching Schools in 2010 but the potential was obvious. The idea is a simple one: take the very best schools, ones that are already working to improve other schools, and put them in charge of teacher training and professional development for the whole system. Via the great work of the National College this Government has already set up a network of 200 Teaching Schools - with the aim of opening 500 by the end of the Parliament. Their impact has been immediate and profound. Fantastic projects have popped up all over the country - not driven by the demands of Government or by Ministers’ prejudices but by school leaders. Whether it’s Fairlawn Primary in Lewisham supporting Maths teaching across the borough. Or Wroxham school in Hertfordshire working with Cambridge University to develop a new pedagogy that breaks free of previous obsessions with ability-labels. Or the network of Teaching Schools across the North-West who are developing their own school improvement programme for local schools. And, of course, nearly all Teaching Schools are getting much more involved in teacher training. Pushing more teacher training through schools has been an aim of successive Governments since the late eighties. And there have been important initiatives. The last Conservative Government allowed groups of schools to form together to offer teacher training. The Labour Government introduced the Graduate Teacher Programme - allowing typically older trainees to learn on the job - as well as Teach First. In fact this is a global shift. As the OECD’s head of education Andreas Schleicher put it in a speech last year “many countries have shifted the emphasis from academic preparation to preparing professionals in schools instead. Teachers now get into classrooms earlier, spend more time on-site in schools, and get more and better support in the process”. But previous efforts in this country have always been piecemeal - hamstrung by the lack of a proper network of outstanding schools to deliver training on a serious scale. Now we have the Teaching School network. Earlier this year we launched a pilot version of a new programme called School Direct. Teaching Schools were offered the opportunity to bid for teacher training places. Those participating will be able to recruit their own trainees and develop their own training programme in partnership with a university. In return for this additional control the schools will be expected to find a job for the trainee once they finish their training. As such it represents a better deal for both schools and trainees. Because of the short notice and the select group of schools involved we expected a maximum of 500 places would be bid for - instead it was over 1,000, of which 914 were allocated. We were blown away by schools’ enthusiasm. Now these places have been allocated, the schools involved are already recruiting trainees; and working with a wide-range of universities to develop high-quality training programmes; and putting teacher training at the heart of their plans for the future. For example Harris academies have decided to partner with Canterbury Christ Church university and have worked closely with them to select trainees and design a training programme. Harris staff will be as closely involved as possible in the core teaching days on the programme, and will increase this involvement as the programme evolves. Staff from Harris have already accompanied staff from Canterbury Christ Church on a research trip to Finland. And Cabot academies have developed a programme that will see each trainee mentored by an existing outstanding teacher in their chain - following a bespoke 10 day induction in their schools before Autumn term begins. As we grow the Teaching School network, many more heads have come to us, asking to be involved. So we are going to expand School Direct significantly over the next few years. Schools won’t have to be part of a Teaching School alliance to get involved but we envisage that most will - because of the advantages of training across a group of schools. And while we anticipate that the majority of schools participating will want a strong partnership with a higher education institution, we expect that some of the very best schools will want to become their own provider. Indeed some of the most forward thinking Teaching Schools and academy chains have already gone down this route. Like the Kemnal academies trust who will use the wealth of experience in teacher training across their member schools to offer courses in English, mathematics, physics, chemistry and MFL from September. Or Tudor Grange Teaching School alliance who will offer courses in the same subjects from September 2012 with Masters level credits awarded by Cumbria University. By the end of the Parliament we expect as many as 10,000 students a year could be trained by schools that are either offering Schools Direct places or are full providers of teacher training. So there will be a spectrum of engagement for those schools that want to get involved. Some schools may not want to get involved at all. Many will want to participate in School Direct - having the opportunity to recruit staff and develop training programmes with the support and assistance of existing providers. Others will want to run the whole show - taking control of the process from start to finish. As these programmes grow, more and more schools will be able to recruit, train and hire their own teachers; working in partnership with other schools and top-quality ITT providers to give new teachers the best possible start to their careers. New recruits will learn and train in schools, working with experienced teachers and putting their lessons into practice from day one. And they will be recruited with the expectation that they will be employed at the school at the end of their training - something which the traditional, university-based PGCE could never offer. Of course, for existing providers involved in teacher training this will mean some big changes. We want to ensure the very best providers remain committed to teacher education so universities, and others, rated “outstanding” by Ofsted will be guaranteed their existing level of places for the next two years. But we will no longer guarantee places to institutions rated good or lower. They will compete for training places through School Direct, designing courses in collaboration with schools. If schools don’t rate their provision, they will go out of business. And we’re going to work quickly in identifying and shutting down providers which simply aren’t good enough. If they receive two “Requires Improvement” judgements under the new - tougher - Ofsted framework - they will be swiftly de-accredited. If an ITT provider isn’t delivering the sort of high-quality, highly-respected training which each new teacher deserves and needs - then they have no place delivering training at all. Recruiting the best career changers Along with recruiting the best university-leavers and ensuring they are trained in the best schools and universities, I also want to do more to attract more of the best and brightest career-changers. The Graduate Teacher Programme, or GTP, has been in place since 1998. In that time it has delivered some superb training, and recruited some brilliant teachers. But it has also suffered from some serious flaws. Recruitment has been ad hoc - there has never been a sense that the programme is targeted at high-fliers. There has never been a central website that any career-changer interested in becoming a teacher could go to to find places. And sometimes schools have felt frustrated by restrictions over salary and training. So we are going to close the GTP, but build on its strengths to launch a new, school-led teacher training programme for the best career-changers. From September 2013, a new employment-based strand of School Direct will be available for candidates who have already gained at least three years valuable experience in other careers. Any school that wants to participate will be asked to advertise places on a single website which will allow the Teaching Agency to better market the programme to the target audience. Schools will have much greater control of funding - they will be able to decide how much to spend on trainees’ salaries and how much on training - giving them the autonomy and flexibility to decide how to get the biggest possible bang for their buck. And to help schools in deprived areas to recruit and train the very best teachers, schools with 35 per cent or more of their pupils on free school meals will receive a 10 per cent funding premium. In 2013-14, we will fund up to 5,000 places on employment-based School Direct- more than the number of places on the GTP this year. Conclusion The cumulative impact of these changes on initial teacher training will be revolutionary. By the end of this parliament well over half of all training places will be delivered by schools whether through direct provision; Teach First; School Direct; or our new employment-based route. Most of the rest will be doing PGCE courses in existing providers rated outstanding. The weakest providers will no longer be in business. They will have been de-accredited following Ofsted inspections or unable to persuade schools to commission support from them. This represents a huge opportunity for school leaders - to take control of teacher training - to create programmes that reflect their school’s ethos - to recruit better trainees. I was delighted to read in the National College’s independent survey of 2,250 school leaders that 98 per cent think it’s a great job. It is a great job and one that makes such a difference. I want to thank you for all that you have done so far as leaders to improve the life chances of the children and young people in your care. I know that your roles are challenging and that this government is asking even more of you but that is because I believe the children and young people in this country deserve the very best. I am asking you to work with me to move these important proposals forward. It is a big responsibility - you will need to show that you can manage the development and improvement of the profession rather than looking to others to do it for you. But if London’s improvement has taught us anything it is that putting schools in control of their own destiny is the key to success. ENDS"
/government/news/minister-hosts-celebration-to-thank-early-years-providers,"Childcare providers from all over the country were the toast of Westminster yesterday when Childcare Minister Sam Gyimah thanked them for helping his ‘moral mission’ to give the best possible childcare to parents. Over 120 early years professionals were yesterday (2 March 2015) guests of honour at the Department for Education reception in Lancaster House. The guests were thanked by the minister for their role in improving children’s futures and implementing the department’s policies which have resulted in an unprecedented demand for childcare. Childcare Minister Sam Gyimah said: The importance of childcare is huge in a child’s development and upbringing – that’s why we all have a moral mission to get it right. As childcare minister, I’ve been privileged to travel all over the country meeting with providers. The consistently high bar they set made me want to put on an event to say ‘thank you’ for the work they are doing. I am very proud of what we have all achieved during this Parliament to make sure parents can make the best possible childcare choices for their families. During this Parliament, the government has stimulated the market by increasing funding from £2 billion to £3 billion per year and extended the offer of free childcare to 15 hours per week to all 3- and 4-year-olds and 40% of 2-year-olds. Hani Noor, who has been a childminder for 4 years, said: I look after 13 children, which includes 5 2-year-olds who are taking up the government’s offer of 15 free hours of childcare per week. Starting at 2 definitely has social benefits for making friends, and it also makes them more ready for school. Also among the attendees were Rob and Sue Jones, who run Evolution Childcare in Warrington. The couple set up their chain of nurseries in 1998 when former Liverpool and England footballer Rob’s career was cut short by a knee injury. Since then they have expanded to having a range of sites in England as well as abroad in Dubai. Sue Jones said: The 2-, 3- and 4-year-old funding has been fantastic for parents, and the benefits for the children of receiving childcare are huge. They have better social interaction and are more emotionally developed. I think the event was a really good idea and it again shows that the early years is a priority for this government. Rob added: It was lovely to be invited to such a nice place by the minister. It was great to get the invitation and come down and meet so many different types of providers in one place. Parents will also be able to purchase more hours of childcare thanks to the upcoming introduction of tax free childcare and universal credit. Providers have been helped by a simplification of regulations that allow successful nurseries to expand more easily. New childcare businesses have also benefited from a £2 million extension of the government’s childcare business grant scheme, which provides grants of up to £500 to help people set up a new childcare business. Notes to editors Providers and local authorities from counties including Cornwall, Derbyshire, Devon, Gloucestershire, Lancashire, Merseyside, Nottinghamshire, Somerset, Suffolk, Warwickshire, West Midlands and West Yorkshire attended the event. During this Parliament, the Department for Education has: increased spending on childcare from around £2 billion to £3 billion per year increased the number of children attending registered settings by 200,000 (in 2013 compared to 2010) committed to introducing tax-free childcare from autumn 2015. This will be open to almost 2 million families and could save a working family up to £2,000 per child per year enabled organisations to register as childminder agencies which will support new childminders as they start their business and offer more choice for parents raised the skills and status of early years professionals and created more opportunities for people who want to work in the early years through the introduction of early years teachers and early years educators announced an extension of the schools pupil premium into the early years that will be worth £300 per eligible child simplified the regulatory framework and relaxed planning rules so nurseries can expand more easily encouraged new childcare businesses with a £2 million extension of our childcare business grant scheme, which provides grants of up to £500 to help people set up a new childcare business made the early years foundation stage slimmer and less bureaucratic through the Tickell Review [Contact:997]"
/government/news/childminder-choice-has-never-been-better-thanks-to-first-agency,"The first childminder agency ( CMA ) in England will help families find first-class services that fit around their specific working hours and needs. Parents whose childminders fall ill will be offered immediate emergency solutions thanks to St Bede Academy in Bolton becoming the first CMA in the country to gain the green light. The new agency will give parents peace of mind about their child’s education and care with agencies having regular contact with childminders to ensure high standards are being upheld. Childcare Minister Sam Gyimah said: Ensuring parents have access to affordable, flexible, high-quality childcare is part of our plan for education. Agencies will make life easier for parents by providing a one stop shop to help them find the right early education and care for their child. That kind of umbrella role is something that neither a childminder nor a nursery can currently perform themselves. I know many parents greatly value home-based childminder care, as well as the role they play in providing wraparound care for children. That’s why we want to help childminders thrive in offering quality education and care. Childminders’ registration with CMAs is entirely voluntary, and in return they will receive training and administrative support that means they can spend more time focusing on children and less on bureaucracy. Agencies will help new childminders spread their initial costs and will be able to offer financial savings in areas such as group activities and shared resources. Recent reforms have helped all types of childcare, including both independent childminders registered with Ofsted and agency registered childminders. It is now easier for all childminders to access government funding to support 2-, 3- and 4-year-olds. Headteacher of St Bede Academy Jack Hatch said: Achieving our goal of being the first CMA to be registered in the UK means a lot to our childcare organisation. It should help to provide more of our families with excellent-quality affordable childcare and give even more flexibility than we can offer at the present time. Now we have to start recruiting our team of childminders - we’ve already had interest from some prospective people who want to train with us to offer great childcare. Notes to editors Parents will be able to take up their early education funded place for 2-, 3- and 4-year-olds with agency registered childminders, as well as with childminders directly registered with Ofsted. Parents will be able to use childcare vouchers and claim tax credits for using agency registered childminders, as well as with childminders directly registered with Ofsted. St Bede Academy is based on Morris Green Lane, Bolton. [Contact:997]"

Phonics is one of the most robust and recognised ways of helping children to learn to read and write. My report clearly highlights the importance of children starting school ready and able to learn, and I set out in the reading and writing goals the phonic development children should have reached by the age of five. The fact there is no longer a separate section labelled ‘linking sounds and letters’ does not mean I have deprioritised phonics - merging this section into ‘reading’ and ‘writing’ is one of the ways I have slimmed down and simplified the EYFS. A Department for Education spokesman said: There is compelling and comprehensive international evidence that systematic synthetic phonics is the best method for teaching reading. That’s why we are going to give every school support and training to teach it - and introduce a simple reading check at age six to guarantee children have based the basic skills of early reading. Test pre-trialling has been popular and successful with schools - and we are launching a full pilot later this year.

/government/news/two-in-every-five-london-children-are-not-school-ready-by-age-5,"Public Health England ( PHE ) has today (10 August 2015) published a new report showing levels of ‘school readiness’ among London’s children, an indicator of how prepared a child is to succeed in school cognitively, socially and emotionally. In 2013 to 2014, 2 in every 5 children in London did not achieve a ‘good level of development’ ( GLD ) by 5 years old – a measure used to assess school readiness – which is around 39,500 children. Even though school readiness has improved across all boroughs in the capital since 2012 to 2013, there are still inequalities in London. School readiness at age 5 has a strong impact on future educational attainment and life chances. Children who don’t achieve a GLD by age 5 will go on to struggle with their literacy, numeracy, physical and social skills. This can have an impact on outcomes in later life; particularly around health, future earnings, involvement in crime, and death. There are a number of factors that can impact on children reaching a GLD and being school ready, including: gender: boys are 1.3x less likely to have a GLD compared to girls ethnicity: Gypsy and Roma pupils are 3.3x less likely to have a GLD compared to White British pupils family income: those eligible for free school meals are 1.3x less likely to have a GLD compared to those who are not eligible individual circumstances: children with a statement of education needs are 3.5x less likely to have a GLD compared to those who do not have one Early measures that have been shown to improve children’s school readiness include good maternal health (1 in 10 new mothers in London will suffer from a perinatal mental illness), learning activities (speaking to your baby and reading with your child), enhancing physical activity, high quality early education and parenting support programmes. Dr Yvonne Doyle, regional director for PHE London, said: The first 5 years of a child’s life, the foundation years, are absolutely critical; healthy early child development is fundamental to school readiness, which can have a major impact on a child’s life chances. We want to make sure all children in London develop to their full potential and are prepared for the challenges of school and beyond. Effective parenting is a key element in maximising children’s opportunities in life and PHE strives to support the provision of parenting programmes across London. In addition to parental intervention, there is an economic benefit to children being school ready. Investing in quality early care and education has shown to have a greater return on investment than many other economic development options, for example: every £1 invested in quality early care and education saves taxpayers up to £13 in future costs for every £1 spent on early years education, £7 has to be spent to have the same impact in adolescence The cost of delivering these services are outweighed by the benefits to the individual, and to taxpayers and others, through improved educational outcomes, reduced healthcare costs, reduced crime and increased taxes paid, due to increased earnings as adults. Dr Marilena Korkodilos, a paediatrician and child health lead for PHE London, said: We have produced this report to further educate healthcare professionals, parents and carers about the importance of school readiness, show what interventions can improve a child’s levels of development and what can impact on it. We hope our work will contribute to helping give all children in London the best start in life with the resilience, confidence and personal skills to be able to learn.” Background Public Health England exists to protect and improve the nation’s health and wellbeing and reduce health inequalities.

/government/speeches/lord-hill-to-the-sixth-form-colleges-forum,"Introduction My colleague, the Schools Minister Nick Gibb, spoke to you in June and set out the main principles of the Coalition’s education reforms: freedom from bureaucracy and central diktat tackling inequality and disadvantage trusting professionals fairer funding putting in place rigorous standards and accountability. Since then we’ve started overhauling the 16-to-19 funding system, had the Spending Review in October, and published our White Paper yesterday. So it seems a good time to come here today to bring up you to date on where we have got to. But I want to start by paying tribute to all of you, for your hard work, commitment, passion and success in transforming young people’s lives. You’ve long set the pace for the rest of the 16 to 19 sector - higher rates of students going on to university, more creative teaching, stronger leadership, and better targeting for support the most disadvantaged students. You’ve rightly got a great reputation for exactly the sort of motivated and committed staff and students I met this morning - just up the road at Joseph Chamberlain College. So today I want to reaffirm again our commitment to your future, to helping you meet the demands of students, parents, universities and employers. And I want to set the wider challenges ahead and answer some of your concerns head-on: your place in post-16 education how we’re getting out of your hair so you can get on with what you do best - with less red-tape and more freedom how we plan to create a far more even playing field in funding terms, for you to compete fairly with schools and colleges and how now we think there are now opportunities for you, as our reform programme seeks to open up the system. Challenges ahead Our country faces a unique combination of challenges today. We are having to face up to the demands of world economic fluctuations, while keeping pace with our international competitors - all with tighter reins on the public finances. And they pose the toughest question for us in Government and for you in education. Are we equipping young people with the skills, knowledge, motivation and aspirations that employers and universities are demanding? And we’ve got to be honest about the answer. The truth is that too many young people still don’t get the right skills and qualifications for work and further study. Too many are staying on in education and training to get qualifications which aren’t valued by higher education and employers. Too many, particularly from the poorest backgrounds, are turned off learning at an early age, fall back and then get left behind - we have almost a million young people under 24 still not in education, employment or training. And overall, we have a growing gap in terms of academic achievement between rich and poor - with only 40 children of the 80,000 on free school meals going on to study at Oxbridge. That’s why we’re keeping the commitment to raise the participation age to 18 by 2015 - so everyone gets the high-quality education and skills they need to thrive in university and the world of work. And sixth form colleges are at the heart of this - making post-16 education as strong as possible and making sure we keep pace with the best systems in the world. Reform = freedom Nick said in June that sixth form colleges show why giving principals more autonomy led to better results. He’s right. You show us how having freedoms over pay and conditions means you can the best out of your staff. There has to be far more trust in the frontline. We’ve got no interest in constantly breathing down your neck - micromanaging every budget, every college and every class. But the challenge is that these freedoms will come with stronger accountability - to the young people you teach and the communities you serve. All the international evidence we have seen shows us that this combination of autonomy and accountability is the way that the best-performing educational systems are going. And it’s our approach at the heart of the White Paper. We’ve made a start reforming and freeing up the system. Firstly, strengthening qualifications. Over the last two decades, vocational and academic qualifications have been forced to have some kind of uneasy equivalence when actually we should just be making sure that they are all high quality. So our White Paper plans will give universities and employers more say over developing A Levels - to keep them robust and rigorous, and to keep pace with the best systems around the world. We have said to Ofqual that we want them to look at our exam qualifications and compare them to the best in the world. We’ve asked Professor Alison Wolf to lead an independent review of vocational education, so colleges and schools have more freedom to offer qualifications that meet higher education’s and the labour market’s demands. We want to cut the bureaucracy around qualifications, including removing the need to offer every single Diploma subject in all schools and colleges. And we want to work with you further, to make them even simpler to teach and award. Secondly, I want to give you more freedom to get on with your job. We’ve already ended Ofsted inspections for outstanding colleges, scrapped legal requirements to do learner surveys, and stopped in-year funding adjustments. But we want to go further. So today I can also confirm we will repeal a whole series of other overly prescriptive statutory duties which weigh you down: having regard to promoting economic and social wellbeing having regard to guidance about consultation with actual and potential students and employers cooperating with children’s trusts to improve children’s wellbeing, and principals being forced to go through prescriptive development programmes instead of leading their schools. We’re not saying that consulting with students and working with other colleges is not important - but it’s down to you to call the shots. You run high-quality institutions. You directly engage with their pupils and their parents and play an active role in their local communities. I don’t think that you need to be told by central government how to run yourselves. Spending review - hard choices I know that you are concerned about the future of funding. And we’ve had to take some difficult decisions. The Coalition set itself the toughest of tasks in the Spending Review - balancing urgent action to cut the deficit and protecting education as far as possible. And we secured the best possible deal in the wider economic and political climate - meaning we can commit to full participation to 18 and fund a record 1.6 million places for young people by 2015, including an increase in Apprenticeships. But we’ve also had to be realistic. Some programmes would no longer be affordable in their previous form. That’s for example why we had to end Building Schools for the Future. And it’s also why we’re replacing the EMA, with an increased and better targeted scheme of discretionary funding, where schools and colleges themselves judge how to spend it. We didn’t take this decision lightly. But the evidence seems clear that around nine out of ten students would have gone to college or sixth form regardless of whether or not they got the EMA - leaving it unjustifiable and unsustainable in the current economic climate. Our job now is to make sure we get the new fund right, working with you here today and others over the coming weeks on making sure it helps overcome the hardships faced by the poorest students - including extending its existing remit to cover transport costs. And we’ve had to take other hard decisions. It’s right to ask for even more efficient finances in colleges and schools, so we can afford to fund places young people need in post-16 education. The taxpayer is rightly looking at how every penny is spent. Across the public sector, we all have to take responsibility for investing public funds wisely. We’ve all got to get the best deal possible from our procurement, our back office functions, our overheads, and how we work. And in the face of a very tight capital settlement, we must target investment where it is most needed while cutting out wasteful design and procurement processes. That’s why we set up our independent review to get much better value for money out of all our building programmes, which will report to us shortly. I know that you are anxious to hear about wider capital funding beyond March 2011. I intend to set out our longer-term building plans shortly but I want to reassure you that we have been listening very carefully to your arguments. And I want to reassure you that your needs are being considered in detail and equally alongside all our building investment in Early Years and schools - to make sure there is funding available to meet refurbishment costs and pupil numbers. Fairer and more transparent funding I also know that one of the biggest concerns you have is to have a fairer funding system so you can compete on a level playing field with school sixth forms. So ahead of the overall 16-to-19 settlement in December and your final allocations next year, I am today reiterating our commitment to end the sharp funding disparities you face. The wider school funding system we’ve inherited is a mess. It is hideously complex, with little transparency or clarity and with historic, unresolved anomalies meaning there are huge disparities across the country for schools with similar intakes. For colleges, the unfairness is particularly stark. You have suffered in comparison with school sixth forms for years - getting £280 per pupil less on average, meaning a difference of over half a million pounds for a medium-to-large college. That’s why yesterday’s White Paper commits us in black-and-white to ending this inequity and bringing all funding into line with the most efficient providers - in other words, with sixth form and FE colleges. It’s also why we have brought in a much clearer funding system, to allocate and target funding, since we got into power - meaning the money actually follows the students you recruit. And it’s why we are giving you direct responsibility for securing your own borrowings, without it getting bogged down and holding up essential investment by having to be cleared with local authorities. We will work with you to get these changes right and to introduce them as carefully as possible. Playing a bigger role And in return for cutting bureaucracy and helping you compete with schools and general FE colleges, we want you to play a bigger part in our reform programme. Our reforms give you the chance to expand and secure your future. All young people should have access to high-quality sixth forms wherever they live - so we want a far more responsive market. That could mean new sixth form colleges opening where there is a clear demand - something we will always explore in detail. But equally, it could mean you seizing the initiative by partnering or sponsoring new academies and Free Schools, working with the new generation of university technical colleges that Lord Baker is pioneering, or taking the lead in federations with existing schools. You’ve got so much to give your communities. You are among the best, if not the best, providers of A Level education, so I welcome suggestions as to how you can put your experience to work to benefit even more children. Tell us what you think you can do and we will listen. Conclusion We are facing challenging times in the education sector. Sixth form colleges will always have a central role to play - raising aspirations for all, driving up teaching standards, and making leadership stronger. We’ve got a long way to go but we’ve got the basics right, giving you more of what you want: greater freedoms, stronger qualifications, and fairer funding. And in return, I look forward to working with you over the coming months and years, to help us create a world-class education system and to keep sixth form colleges as the jewel in the 16-to-19 crown. Thank you for your time."
/government/news/nick-clegg-hails-a-revolution-in-free-pre-school-education,"The changes include a huge boost for hundreds of two-year-olds who will get access to free childcare earlier than originally billed. At the moment, all three and four year olds are eligible for 15 hours of free early education per week. Two year olds from the most disadvantaged backgrounds were due to start receiving free pre-school education from 2013, but the Deputy Prime Minister wants to see the programme rolling out early from this September. The Deputy Prime Minister is announcing a series of new changes to childcare, including: Early rollout of free pre-school education for two-year-olds in ten areas - these areas will trial the entitlement, with just under a thousand two-year-olds set to benefit from this September. Greater flexibility for parents - the hours in which parents can bring in their children for their free place will be extended by two hours. Currently, parents are restricted by having to drop their children off no earlier than 8am and picking them up no later than 6pm. This will be extended to 7am - 7pm. Giving parents the option to spread their free nursery place over two days rather than three. Under the current rules, hours have to be divided over a minimum of three days, which means parents can only leave their children for five hours a day. This doesn’t offer enough flexibility for parents who work part time, for example. Currently, many working parents are unable to take up all of the hours available to them because of this. Revised statutory guidance making absolutely clear parents do not have to pay to access their child’s free early education place - this follows concerns that some free nursery places are being made conditional on parents being able to make additional payments. Currently, more than 800,000 three and four year olds nationally access up to 15 hours of free early education every week. The Government is pledging to extend free childcare to around 150,000 of the least advantaged two-year-olds from September 2013, rising to around 260,000 in September 2014. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said: We’re revolutionising the early start our children get in life - there will be more free childcare, it will be higher quality, and it will be more flexible for parents. “By getting things right from the off we’re making sure our youngsters are ready to learn when they start school so that they get the most out of their education. Every child should have a fair crack at the whip from the start and be able to go on to fulfil their potential.” New figures published today set out the number of two-year-old children eligible from 2013 in all 152 local authority areas, with a total of around 150,000 set to benefit. The figures will help local authorities prepare for the expansion of free places. It was also confirmed that money to fund free early education will be ring-fenced within the Dedicated Schools Grant from April 2013, so that nurseries, pre-schools and childminders can be confident that, if they expand to offer these new places, the funding will be available. The additional amount invested on early education by the Government will have risen by more than £1 billion a year. Later this morning (Wednesday 30 May), Deputy Prime Minister and Children’s Minister Sarah Teather will hold a summit with some of the country’s biggest childcare providers to discuss how best to deliver the extension for two-year-olds. Sarah Teather, Children’s Minister, said: High quality early education is the key to making a difference early on in a child’s life. All the evidence shows how important it is for their development. “The challenge now is to make sure the least advantaged two-year-olds are able to access their early education entitlement. Too often, the most disadvantaged children don’t get what they are entitled to. It’s important we now work with councils, nurseries and childminders to target free early education at those who stand to benefit the most. “I am determined that the Coalition Government will do all it can to make sure the poorest two-year-olds and their families can reap the benefits from our investment around the country.” Notes to editors The announcements follow a consultation by the Government on how early education is delivered, the Government’s full response is here .  The 10 areas to trial the entitlement to free early education in part of their area from September this year.  The areas are Blackpool, Cornwall, Greenwich, Kent, Lambeth, Lancashire, Newcastle, Northamptonshire, Peterborough and Rotherham. Currently, 95 per cent of three and four year olds access 15 hours of free early education every week - more than 800,000 children nationally.  The Government set out how it will now extend this entitlement to the 20 per cent least advantaged two year olds. This means around 150,000 children will benefit in phase 1 from September 2013.  From September 2014 this will rise to around 260,000 two year olds."
/government/speeches/fairer-school-funding,"I am today announcing how we will allocate £390 million of additional schools funding to the least fairly funded local areas in England. This will ensure fairer funding of English schools. When I addressed the House in March on fairer schools funding, I confirmed the government’s commitment to ensure that, across the country, schools have a fair funding allocation that equips them to provide a world-class education. Since then, we have consulted on a proposal to allocate additional funding to schools in the least fairly funded areas. The consultation has confirmed that there is an overwhelming consensus that the allocation of funding to local areas across England is unfair. The proposal we consulted on was as follows. First, we would protect all local authority budgets at the same cash level in 2015 to 2016 as in 2014 to 2015. After this, we would increase the budgets of the least fairly funded local areas by setting minimum funding levels that all areas should attract for their pupils and schools. Where a local area already attracted these minimum funding levels, we would not make any change to the amount of funding per pupil that it received for 2015 to 2016. If a local area attracted less than these minimum funding levels for the pupils and schools in its area, we would increase its budget so that it met those levels. I have listened carefully to the views of honourable members and considered over 570 responses to the consultation. I am confirming today that we will allocate extra money to the least fairly funded local areas using the approach we set out in our recent consultation. I have concluded that this is the fairest way of distributing the additional funding we have available. I am pleased to say that we are allocating £390 million additional funding - £40 million more than I announced in March. Sixty-nine local areas will attract additional funding. My announcement today means that, for example, Cambridgeshire - the lowest funded area in 2014 to 2015 - will now receive an additional £311 for every pupil. Northumberland will now receive an additional £307 for each of its pupils and Croydon an additional £278. Through the additional funding we are making available, every local area’s allocation of funding will reflect a minimum basic per pupil amount and minimum amounts reflecting other pupil and school characteristics. In every local area, this will mean for example that the most deprived pupils in primary schools will attract at least £4,454; in key stage 3 at least £5,820; and key stage 4 at least £6,372, and this will continue to be supplemented by further direct funding through the pupil premium. In the consultation we published in March this year, we gave an initial indication of how, under our proposal, additional funding might be allocated to local areas. We were clear that these indicative figures were calculated using the most recent data available at that time, and that we would use updated data for the final allocations. We were clear that this meant that the distribution of additional funding to local authorities would be different from the indicative allocations set out in the consultation. The additional funding that we will allocate to local authorities addresses the unfair distribution of mainstream schools funding. During the consultation I have heard the concern that we will not have a completely fair education funding system until we also reform the distribution of funding for pupils with high-cost special educational needs and for early years pupils. This will be our priority for reform during the next parliament, alongside introducing a full national funding formula for schools. In the 69 local areas that will attract additional funding, schools forums will now be able to agree a local funding formula for 2015 to 2016. Our intention is that schools in these areas should receive the full benefit of the additional funding we are making available: the local authority should not hold back the extra funding to pay for centrally provided services. However, I want to be clear that it is for local authorities, in consultation with their schools forum, to decide how they distribute this additional funding between the schools in their area. If it is the collective judgement of a schools forum that there is a better way of distributing funding locally, then schools will not receive a budget that reflects each of the minimum funding levels directly. Today’s announcement of an additional £390 million increase in funding will make a real difference on the ground in the least fairly funded local areas, without creating instability and uncertainty in other local areas. We remain committed to taking the next vital steps towards fully fair funding once long- term spending plans are in place after the next spending review. I will place copies of the documents I have published today in the House libraries."

/government/news/no-notice-behaviour-inspections-begin,"Sir Michael Wilshaw has vowed to tackle what he calls ‘a culture of casual acceptance’ of low-level disruption and poor attitudes to learning which he believes is holding back too many of England’s schools. Ofsted’s Annual Report published in December showed that 700,000 pupils were attending schools where behaviour needed to improve. Sir Michael said polling of parents regularly showed that good discipline and behaviour in the classroom was their number one concern – but the issue was often much further down the priority list of schools themselves. The behaviour inspections get underway next week. Schools are being selected for the one-day unannounced visits on the basis of parental concerns as well as evidence gathered from previous inspections. During the visits, inspectors will look at a wide range of evidence to reach a judgement on the standards of behaviour in the school. This will include assessing the culture of the school and how pupils interact with each other and with staff. Inspectors will observe pupils’ behaviour in the classroom, between lessons, during breaks, at lunchtime and after school. They will also speak directly to teachers and pupils to see how incidents of poor behaviour are addressed. The behaviour inspection reports will be published on the Ofsted website and made available to parents. If Ofsted finds that a school is effectively tackling poor behaviour, this will be made clear in the inspection findings. Where there is evidence that behaviour remains a problem, this may result in a full inspection being brought forward. HM Chief Inspector, Sir Michael Wilshaw, said: ‘Parents want to send their children to schools where they can be confident in the knowledge that behaviour is good. ‘Ofsted is there to champion this cause. ‘Headteachers and leadership teams determine the culture of the school and they must ensure that high standards of behaviour are maintained both in and outside the classroom. ‘Good headteachers understand that positive behaviour underpins effective teaching and learning. ‘They make themselves visible and make sure lessons aren’t undermined by a disrespectful attitude towards staff or authority. ‘Ofsted is determined to ensure that those who are failing to get a grip on poor behaviour take action to create the right conditions for children to learn.’ Sir Michael added: ‘As I have previously said, the retention of staff is as important as recruitment. ‘It is, therefore, vital that newly qualified teachers and those in the early years of the profession are able to learn the craft of the classroom without having to face the daily struggle of dealing with children intent on disrupting lessons.’ Information about parental concerns around poor behaviour will be gathered from the results of Parent View questionnaires. Parent View is an online facility that allows parents and carers to give their views about their child’s school at any time during the school year. The questionnaire is also the main mechanism for parents to give their views about their child’s school to inspectors at the time of a school inspection. The Office for Standards in Education, Children’s Services and Skills (Ofsted) regulates and inspects to achieve excellence in the care of children and young people, and in education and skills for learners of all ages. It regulates and inspects childcare and children’s social care, and inspects the Children and Family Court Advisory Support Service (Cafcass), schools, colleges, initial teacher training, work-based learning and skills training, adult and community learning, and education and training in prisons and other secure establishments. It assesses council children’s services, and inspects services for looked after children, safeguarding and child protection. [Contact:2325]"

And who better than someone who’s living the early years himself - my son. He turned up to the office and grabbed a copy of Nursery World - I thought I would take a photo of it. I know he’s a fan - as am I - and I appreciate the hard work and dedication everyone in this room has shown in helping parents to give their children the best start in life. And we’ve come a long way. But we are currently facing a big challenge, with a massive shift in the way we live. So now is very much the time I believe to be a childcare business, with some good opportunities. More women than ever before have the choice, and are choosing, to work. There are 14.4 million women in work today - up 60% since the early 1970s. Around two-thirds of mothers in England now work. And the way we work has also changed. Parents are taking advantage of flexible working and part-time working, so they can fit their work lives around their family. I believe no parent should have to choose between their career and their children. Because childcare isn’t a women’s issue. It’s a parental issue. We also know how much the early years matter - which is why we’ve introduced flexible working and shared parental leave to help parents balance work and family. The challenge The sector needs to offer more flexible, seamless solutions to meet these needs. Parents want childcare that’s affordable and of the highest quality. Childcare that fits in with their commute, with shifts and freelance work. And childcare that, above all, gives them choice. Because as we all know, childcare is about more than just where you leave your child. It’s about development, and working closely with a family to give a child the very best start in life. As such, I believe all workers today, alongside parents, are hugely important in the child’s development and upbringing. But there is also an unsung role outside the immediate family. The evidence is mounting that childcare plays a crucial role in development, in early education and in getting children ready for school. Of course this has knock-on effects for combatting disadvantage and for driving social mobility. So there is one message I want to get out today: it is that we have a moral mission to get this right. Which is why we all need to be prepared to take a fresh look at the issues and be open to new ideas, so you can do even better for the children in your care. But how do we meet the challenge of a changing workforce and greater need? Some people say pouring more and more money into the sector is the answer. Funding There are already significant resources in the system. There’s the free entitlement for 3- and 4-year-olds and the £755 million of funding that we’re putting into free early education for the most disadvantaged 2-year-olds this financial year. I know that some have said that the funding we’re providing isn’t enough. And you’ve told me the rates providers get from local councils is an issue. That’s why I can announce today that we’re publishing a benchmarking tool, to show how the funding for 2-, 3- and 4-year-olds is distributed across the country. I’d urge you to look at this to see how early years funding works in your area - how much councils keep for central support, and what goes to the front line - to providers, schools, and ultimately to children. There should be more debate at local authority level, including at schools forums. There needs to be more transparency about where this funding goes. And there’s more money coming through. There’s the tax-free childcare scheme starting in autumn 2015 - which will see an extra £750 million going to parents to spend on childcare - to help either cut their childcare bill or buy more hours of care. This will help just under 2 million families - twice the number that benefit from the current employer voucher scheme. There’s also the £50 million we’re providing to extend the pupil premium into the early years. As a result, each provider that delivers early education to disadvantaged 3- or 4-year-olds will get £300 for each of those children attending full time; and a pro rata amount for those taking it part-time. There are significant resources going into the system. Need for innovation, not just more money But it’s not just about more money. It’s about making the money we have work harder. About finding new and better ways of making it go further. And that’s want I want to focus on today - innovation - and how we can harness it to deliver more value for parents and children and meet the scale of the challenge we face. And ultimately rise to the moral mission of doing better for all children, whatever their background. The need for innovation certainly isn’t specific to this sector. My ministerial colleagues often tell me, for example, how giving teachers more freedom to innovate has helped turn around some of our toughest schools. We’re now seeking to do the same in children’s services and empowering social workers to make the changes they know will transform life chances. There’s no reason why childcare should be treated differently - why shouldn’t we trust you as we trust them? - to innovate to raise standards. So what do we mean by innovation? For me, it means thinking beyond the silos in which we tend to operate, with the child at the centre. With nurseries, childminders, schools and other providers thinking about what they can do collectively and creatively to deliver what works for families. And I’m delighted to see that many of you are already seizing opportunities to do just this and break new ground - by, for example, accessing social investment. Social investment The London Early Years Foundation has, for example, received £1.25 million of funding from the Big Issue Invest and Bridges Ventures via the Cabinet Office’s (Investment and) Contract Readiness Fund. They’ll use this to add another 10 nurseries, all working to their innovative business model, to their portfolio across London. And last month, the charity and childcare provider 4Children became the first organisation to benefit from a £700,000 loan from the FSE Social Impact Accelerator Fund. This will help them take on at least 50 new children’s centres and nurseries over the next 3 years, offering subsidised nursery places and support to more than 15,000 new families each year. Excellent, enterprising examples that I hope inspire you - though, of course I realise, of course that I’m speaking to an audience - in fact, a sector - of innovators and pioneers. Existing and growing innovation in childcare Self starters who have set up your own businesses, who have taken out loans or put your own money on the line. This takes guts and vision. So you understand, better than most, just what innovation means - your track record, for example, in expanding provision in response to demographic and social changes speaks for itself. And we don’t want you to stop innovating - and showing just what’s possible when a bit of ambition and flair can add more to it. Look at how so many of you are working with local authorities to deliver the free entitlement with more flexibility where parents want it. By stretching delivery over 50 or 51 weeks, businesses can maximise income from parents who only want to take up 10 to 12 hours a week of their free entitlement. This gives providers more stability by increasing occupancy during holiday periods. The extension of the 2-year-old entitlement has opened up a range of opportunities for providers to expand their businesses into new areas. It has also promoted more partnership working between local authorities and other public services to deliver social improvements. We can see that the local authority in Stockport, for example, renovated a flat in a deprived tower block to create a hub for a range of community interventions and outreach services. A private provider now operates out of this venue to deliver early education to 16 funded 2-year-olds. The council then uses the venue in the afternoon to deliver a range of family services, operated by the children’s centre and health colleagues. We can also see nurseries increasingly working with schools not only drive to greater efficiencies, but to also provide a more joined-up, flexible service for modern working parents. We can see how well this works at Cobbs Brow Tiny Acorns, a fantastic new provider for 40 2-year-olds which has opened in Lancashire. This is managed by a private provider, but sits on a school site. Well done to all involved for completing the whole build in under 2 weeks, making sure that children can start their places as soon as possible. Childminders too are starting to work more flexibly and imaginatively with schools to offer wraparound care. For example, we can see more childminder settings employing assistants. This allows them to offer more childcare places and offer more convenience for parents by helping with drop-offs and pick-ups at schools. And having changed the rules to make it possible for childminder agencies to be established, we can see that one of these new CMAs , St Bede Academy in Bolton, is wrapping its childminder service around schools. And we can see this more responsive approach starting to spread. According to NDNA ’s latest business survey almost 80% of nurseries are working in partnership locally to offer wraparound services, with schools beginning to become partners. And while it’s fantastic to see such enterprise, we understand the challenge of starting, building and growing a business. Support for businesses Hence our efforts to create the conditions to make this easier and to help you innovate. To this end, I’m delighted to announce today that I’m talking to the Department of Communities and Local Government to see how we can help with business rates. And there’s a lot of help we’re providing from government. Both in the form of general business support - through, for instance, the free advice and funding, which runs into millions, being offered by BIS for small businesses looking to expand. There are also VCS grants to help grow skills in the sector. And in the form of specific measures to break down barriers. The Ofsted inspection framework frees providers to think more radically by focusing on not how you do things, but what you achieve. We also have an EYFS regulatory framework with less red tape. And a revised role for local authorities that gives good and outstanding childcare providers freedom to think radically and raise the bar. On top of this, we’re providing help and advice to help childcare businesses get off the ground, grow and diversify: through the childcare business grant scheme, which has, so far, distributed £1 million to support 29,000 new childcare places and through changes in regulations via the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Bill which make it easier for you to expand Conclusion So we’re behind you all the way. And I want to do all I can to work with you - to ensure that your businesses thrive and succeed. To help you do what you came into this job to do - to be there for parents and to transform children’s life chances. Which means taking your proven capacity for innovation up a gear - and letting me know about all the amazing, trailblazing things you’re doing to lead improvement in the sector. As I said earlier, we have a moral mission to leave no stone unturned to provide the next generation with a better foundation for a brighter future. I know that this is your ultimate priority - it’s mine too. Which is why I’m delighted to be working with you and confident that there’s much more we can achieve together."
/government/news/a-third-of-children-reach-expected-level-in-pilot-of-phonics-check,"Schools Minister Nick Gibb today said that the Government was “unashamedly ambitious” in its bid to drive up the standard of children’s reading. Mr Gibb said that although it was good that more than 80 per cent of children routinely met expected reading levels at age seven and age 11, it was time to focus on driving up the performances of the one in five children who fail to reach the expected level and on getting more children to exceed expectations. He said synthetic phonics, taught systematically, was the method proven to improve reading standards for all children, including the weakest readers, and ensure they reached their potential. Mr Gibb acknowledged classroom teachers’ efforts to improve children’s reading skills but pointed to figures showing that: More than 80,000 seven-year-olds can read no better than a five-year-old. One in 10 11-year-old boys can read no better than a seven-year-old. The percentage of seven-year-olds and 11-year-olds who meet the expected level has flat-lined over the last five years. Business leaders repeatedly highlight the poor standard of literacy among so many of our school leavers. Internationally, he said that: England is rated 25th in the world for reading, according to the 2009 PISA reading study, down from seventh nine years ago. Our 15-year-olds are judged by PISA to be 18 months behind those in Shanghai and at least six months behind those in Canada, Australia and New Zealand. England was third in the PIRLS international reading tables in 2001. In the most recent 2006 survey, England was 16th. Nick Gibb was speaking as figures were released showing that 32 per cent of six-year-olds who took the screening check reached what he called the “appropriately challenging” expected level, which was set by about 50 teachers whose schools were involved in the pilot. He said the figures suggested many more pupils could benefit from phonics, giving them a solid grounding in the basics at an early stage. Teachers can then build on these skills so that more children develop into flourishing, confident readers by the end of Key Stage 1. The pilot check was taken this summer by Year 1 pupils in about 300 schools, 27 per cent of whom said they teach phonics systematically, as opposed to teaching children mixed methods such as picture clues and sight memory to read words. This ratio is believed to be broadly in line with the picture across England’s primary schools. The short check involves pupils reading 40 words to their teacher. The type of words in the check are covered by all good quality phonics schemes by the end of Year 1. Mr Gibb said it was vital that pupils are able to read these words by the end of Year 1 to give them the best chance of future success. The most common score achieved by pupils in the pilot was 40 out of 40. Following a positive independent evaluation in September, the phonics check will be rolled out nationally next summer. The check will help provide teachers with vital information to identify pupils needing extra help with reading. Schools’ individual results will not be published. Nick Gibb said: We need to face up to the uncomfortable truth that, despite the hard work of teachers, not enough of our children are able to read to a high enough standard. We have to take account of our place internationally and listen to business leaders concerned about many school leavers’ literacy. The Government can no longer simply congratulate itself on the proportion of pupils reaching the expected level. The phonics check’s expected level, set by teachers, is appropriately challenging. We must adjust our sights if we are to tackle the country’s reading problem. The levels we expect children to reach at Key Stage 1 and Key Stage 2 must not be the limits of our ambition - they should be considered the minimum we expect. And we must get those below the level up to a standard that will help them progress further. A solid grounding in phonics will help many children who are weak readers to improve. It will also see more pupils achieve a high Level 2 or a Level 3 score at the end of Key Stage1. It is this level of achievement which puts children on the path to success. I am unashamedly ambitious in wanting to see all children reading to the very highest standard. Evidence from around the world points to synthetic phonics, taught systematically, as the method that will bring all children up to the high level we want. Teachers in the pilot say the new check will allow them to identify children’s reading problems they hadn’t previously been aware of. Those pupils will then be given the extra help they need to become confident, fluent readers. Many teachers have started to embrace phonics and some schools performed very strongly in the pilot. But the results also show that some other schools could be more systematic in their teaching of phonics and we are supporting them to do this. The teaching of phonics is being prioritised in primary teacher training. We are giving schools up to £3,000 in match funding so they can buy training products and books. And we are making phonics and reading a key part of the new Ofsted inspection process. A good start in reading Statistics show that pupils who achieve a good start in the first few years of reading are very likely to progress quickly throughout school. 2010 data showed that of those children who had previously achieved a strong Level 2 (2a) in Key Stage 1 reading: 98 per cent went on to achieve the expected Level 4 or above in KS2 66 per cent achieved Level 5 in Key Stage 2 2010 data showed that: of the children who only just achieved Level 2 (2c) in reading at Key Stage 1 reading 73 per cent went on to achieve the expected Level 4 or above 20 per cent achieved Level 5. Pupils who reach Level 2 in reading are expected to be able to read simple texts with some understanding, give an opinion about characters, events or ideas, and put sounds together to understand new words. The Government believes all children should at least be secure in these skills by age seven, and that many should achieve a Level 2a. In Year 2, many pupils should also be covering some of the Level 3 reading skills. This means they should be reading books over and above their phonics scheme. They will be able to show an understanding of the writer’s purpose, and will be starting to discuss their ideas about the book. The current expected standards of attainment have been in place as part of the National Curriculum since 1999. The National Curriculum Review will ensure that the content, breadth and level of challenge of England’s new National Curriculum is comparable with the curricula of the world’s highest performing education systems. This will undoubtedly mean raised expectations. This will help England to move back up the international league tables, and ensure children leave school with the knowledge which will stand them in good stead throughout their career and adult life. The Pilot Check The Year 1 phonics screening check was piloted in about 300 schools in June 2011 - 229 of these came from a nationally representative sample. In total, 8,963 children participated in the pilot from schools in the representative sample. Pilot schools were recruited in February/March 2011. They were given details of the content and structure of the screening check at the training meetings in late May/early June, just ahead of their pupils taking the check. The overall structure of the check was designed at a series of meetings in September and October 2010, with a group of phonics experts (academics and product developers) and teachers. Ofqual was also represented at these meetings. In 2012, the check will take place in all primary schools with six-year-old children during the week commencing Monday 18 June. How does the check work? A pupil sits one-on-one with a teacher they know, and is asked to read 40 words aloud. They have seen 20 of these words before. The other 20 words are new to them, and will be “non-words”. The check normally takes a few minutes to complete. There is no time limit. If a child is struggling, the teacher can stop the check early. The check is designed not to be stressful for children. Non-words are important to include because words such as “vap” or “jound” are new to all children. They cannot be read by memory or vocabulary - children have to use their decoding skills so it is a fair and accurate way to assess ability to decode. An example of a check, including words used, can be found on our website . How Phonics Works Phonics teaches children how to: recognise the sounds that each individual letter makes; identify the sounds that different combinations of letters make - such as “sh” or “oo”; and blend these sounds together to make a word. Children can then use this knowledge to “de-code” new words that they see. This is the first important step in learning to read. Research shows that when phonics is taught in a structured way - starting with the easiest sounds, progressing through to the most complex - that it is the most effective way of teaching young children to read. It is particularly helpful for children aged five to seven. Almost all children who have good teaching of phonics will learn the skills they need to tackle new words. They go on to read any kind of text. Most importantly, they will read for enjoyment. They also tend to read more accurately than those taught using other methods, such as “look and say”. This includes children who find learning to read difficult, for example those who have dyslexia. High-quality evidence The Department for Education today published an evidence note detailing some of the research supporting the use of phonics as the most effective method to teach children how to read. It includes the findings of a number of studies, including: A seven-year study in Clackmannanshire, Scotland, of the teaching of synthetic phonics to 300 children found they made more progress in reading and spelling than other children their age. A 2005 Australian report, Teaching Reading, which said: The incontrovertible finding from the extensive body of local and international evidence-based literacy research is that for children during the early years of schooling (and subsequently if needed) to be able to link their knowledge of spoken language to their knowledge of written language, they must first master the alphabetic code - the system of grapheme-phoneme correspondences that link written words to their pronunciations. Because these are both foundational and essential skills for the development of competence in reading, writing and spelling, they must be taught explicitly, systematically, early and well. The US National Reading Panel report of 2006, which said: Systematic synthetic phonics instruction had a positive and significant effect on disabled readers’ reading skills. These children improved substantially in their ability to read words and showed significant, albeit small, gains in their ability to process text as a result of systematic synthetic phonics instruction. This type of phonics instruction benefits both students with learning disabilities and low-achieving students who are not disabled. Moreover, systematic synthetic phonics instruction was significantly more effective in improving low socio-economic status (SES) children’s alphabetic knowledge and word reading skills than instructional approaches that were less focused on these initial reading skills… Across all grade levels, systematic phonics instruction improved the ability of good readers to spell. The final report of the Independent Review of the Teaching of Early Reading, by Jim Rose in 2006, emphasised that beginner readers should be taught using a systematic approach to phonics. He cautioned that evidence submitted to the review which suggested using a mix of approaches could hinder children’s progress: “A model of reading which encourages switching between various strategies, particularly when phonic work is regarded as only one such strategy, all of equal worth, risks paying insufficient attention to the critical skills of word recognition which must first be secured by beginner readers, [for example] if beginner readers are encouraged to infer from pictures the word they have to decode …It may also lead to diluting the focused phonics teaching that is necessary for securing accurate word reading.” Ofsted’s 2010 report, Reading by Six: How the Best Schools Do It, looked at inspection evidence from a sample of 12 primary schools. It explains that “concentrated and systematic use of phonics is key to their success; this is based on high-quality and expert teaching that gives pupils the opportunity to apply what they have learnt through reading, writing and comprehension of what they are reading”. Evaluation An independent evaluation of the pilot check was conducted by the Centre for Education and Inclusion Research (CEIR) at Sheffield Hallam University for the Department for Education. It found that: 43 per cent of pilot schools were able to identify pupils with phonics problems of which they were not already aware. All aspects of the check were seen as appropriate by at least 74 per cent of teachers. Three quarters of pilot schools said the check assessed phonic decoding ability accurately. Most schools interviewed in the pilot also plan to use the results to inform their teaching and planning. Most teachers and pupils understood the purpose of the check correctly. More than 90 per cent of teachers said the content of the check was suitable on most levels. 83 per cent of teachers said the number of words was suitable; 80 per cent said the type of vocabulary was suitable; and 74 per cent thought the non-words used were suitable. The check took on average three hours for schools to prepare for the check, and 12-and-a-half hours to administer it. 65 per cent of schools found the resources used to administer the check “straightforward” or “very straightforward” to manage. 89 per cent of pilot schools said the guidance provided to them by the Department for Education was ‘useful’ or ‘very useful’. Pilot schools wanted detailed results of the check. Almost all 97 per cent wanted pupil-level results and 88 per cent wanted commentary on national-level results. Some 90 per cent of schools wanted benchmarking data to help them set appropriate expectations for their pupils. The experience of the check was positive for most pupils. Some 62 per cent of pilot schools felt the experience had been positive for all pupils, while 31 per cent said it was neither positive nor negative. The check took on average between four and nine minutes to complete per pupil. Case studies A series of case studies can be found on the DfE’s website . Information for Parents The Department for Education today published a leaflet for parents on phonics and the check . [Contact:997] Website: www.education.gov.uk/help/contactus"
/government/speeches/written-ministerial-statement-by-michael-gove-on-schools-financial-settlement-education-spending--2,"Today I am announcing local authority allocations for their Dedicated Schools Grant (DSG) and capital for 2011-12 and for the Early Intervention Grant in 2011-12 and 2012-13. Schools I can confirm that, as proposed in our consultation, we will continue with the current distribution method for funding local authorities. As signalled in the consultation, we are simplifying the funding system by mainstreaming relevant grants into the DSG on the same per-pupil distribution as this year. 2011-12 Guaranteed Units of Funding (GUFs) are therefore the sum of 2010-11 GUFs and the per-pupil grant allocations. This means that at local authority, level allocations for school funding are flat cash per pupil for 2011-12. To protect those local authorities that have falling pupil numbers, I have put in place arrangements so that no authority will lose more than 2 per cent of its budget in cash terms compared with 2010-11. Following this announcement, local authorities will now be able to work with their schools forums to produce 2011-12 budgets for their maintained schools. This will include resources from grants mainstreamed into DSG. Local authorities will be required to take account of the previous level of these grants in constructing their settlement for schools. This is to prevent turbulence for those schools who have previously received funding through grants that we are mainstreaming. Although the overall schools budget before the addition of the pupil premium will stay at the same level per pupil, the actual level of budget for each individual school will vary. It will depend on local decisions about how best to meet needs. This does mean that some individual schools may see cash cuts in their budgets; either because they have fewer pupils or because changes are made within local authorities to the distribution of funding. I have, therefore, decided to apply a national protection arrangement for schools - the minimum funding guarantee - and have set it so that no school will see a reduction compared with its 2010-11 budget (excluding sixth form funding) of more than 1.5 per cent per pupil before the pupil premium is applied. The guarantee applies to a school’s overall 2010-11 budget including grants that have been mainstreamed into DSG. Capital The capital settlement for my department was extremely tight, with a 60 per cent reduction in 2014-15 compared to the historic high of 2010-11. I know that there are schools in need of refurbishment which have missed out from previous Government capital programmes, and who feel they have therefore been treated unfairly. I will continue to invest in the school estate. Indeed we are investing £15.8 billion of capital over the Spending Review period, and the average annual capital budget over the period will be higher than the average annual capital budget in the 1997-98 to 2004-05 period. However, over the next few years our priority is to reduce this country’s budget deficit. This is essential, as the amount we are currently spending on debt interest payments could be used to rebuild or refurbish ten schools every day. However, I realise that in the short term it will be difficult for schools to adjust to reduced capital funding. The recommendations from the Sebastian James review of DfE’s capital programmes will inform the allocation of capital from 2012-13. But schools and local authorities need information now on capital for 2011-12 so that they can begin to plan. I am today announcing the allocation of £2137m1 of capital funding for schools in 2011-12. There are two particular pressures we face which have informed how I have allocated this funding. First, I have inherited substantial forward commitments for the Building Schools for the Future, Academy and myplace projects which I did not stop in July. Energetic efforts are being made by local authorities, contractors and others to reduce the cost of these projects, but I expect the cost of these commitments to remain significant over the Spending Review period. If the Building Schools for the Future programme had not been stopped there would have been no additional funding for schools outside that programme or for urgently needed primary school places. Second, there are significant pressures for additional school places, particularly at primary age, in many areas of the country because of rising birth rates and changed migration patterns. In 2011-12, £800m will be available to local authorities to address the need to provide additional school places. I have doubled the amount to be spent on what is called basic need from the levels spent by the previous Government. I recognise that this issue needs to be addressed and I am supporting local areas to do so. Even where funding is tight, it is essential that buildings and equipment are properly maintained, to ensure that health and safety standards are met, and to prevent a backlog of decay building up which is very expensive to address. Therefore, in 2011-12, £1337m will be available for capital maintenance for schools2, with over 1bn being allocated for local areas to prioritise according to maintenance need. The voluntary-aided sector will receive its fair share of this as I have decided to retain the Locally Coordinated VA Programme for a further year. In addition, £195m will be allocated directly to schools3 for their own use. This is a much lower rate than previously. The Audit Commission criticised the allocation of large amounts of funding to schools that was not targeted to building need. Therefore, in view of the need to prioritise, I have balanced the bulk of maintenance funding to local authorities, to support local prioritisation and larger projects, with coordinated and efficient procurement. Details of the allocations of basic need and maintenance funding to each authority, and indicative amounts of the capital allocations for their schools, are being sent to local authorities today and published on the website. I shall also make copies available in the parliamentary libraries. I know that for longer term planning, local authorities would welcome further security on their capital funding from 2012-13. As I have said, the capital review will inform funding from 2012-13. However, whilst the methodology of allocation and management of the capital funding may change, I can confirm that the headline annual amounts of funding for basic need and for maintenance will for 2012-13 until 2014-15 be in line with the amounts I have announced today for 2011-12. Local Authority Early Intervention Grant In challenging times the Government is freeing local authorities to focus on essential frontline services, and to invest in early intervention and prevention to produce long-term savings and better results for children, young people and families. A key element of this approach is the creation of a new Early Intervention Grant for local authorities in England, worth £2212m in 2011-12 and £2297m in 2012-13. It replaces a number of former funding streams, which are listed in a note on my department’s website. In a tight funding settlement, some reduction in central government support was inevitable. In 2011-12, the amount to be allocated through EIG is 10.9 per cent lower than the aggregated 2010-11 funding through the predecessor grants. The new grant will however provide a substantial funding stream, with new flexibility to enable local authorities to act more strategically and target investment early, where it will have the greatest impact. Universal, as well as specialist, services have an important role to play in identifying and supporting families who need extra help before problems escalate, and helping them get more intensive support if needed. Our schools, health services, police and other services should all be concerned to spot and support the most vulnerable families early. There are great examples of effective partnerships which already do this across the country. I want to draw attention to two important aspects of the new grant. The first is the Government’s commitment to trusting professionals and creating local flexibility. Greater freedom at local level, to pool and align funding, will help local authorities and their partners achieve better results. That is why we have scrapped top-down performance management, and why we are reducing radically the number of ring-fenced grants. The Spending Review signalled a power shift between central and local government - ensuring local communities have a greater say in the issues that affect them. The EIG is not ring-fenced, giving local authorities the flexibility to respond to local needs and drive reform, while supporting a focus on early intervention across the age range. The second key point is the Government’s commitment to investment and reform in early intervention at a time of financial constraint. Against the background of greater flexibility to decide priorities locally, there are key areas of early intervention where the Government is ensuring that the overall grant provides support: a. Sure Start children’s centres. There is enough money in the EIG to maintain the existing network of Sure Start Children’s Centres, accessible to all but identifying and supporting families in greatest need. Local authorities continue to have duties under the Childcare Act 2006 to consult before opening, closing or significantly changing children’s centres and to secure sufficient provision to meet local need and Together for Children will be ready to assist LAs in making plans to keep centres open. Important new investment through Department of Health budgets to provide 4200 extra health visitors, working alongside outreach and family support workers, will enable stronger links with local health services. b. Two-year-olds. Evidence shows that early education is particularly beneficial for the most disadvantaged, for whom gaps in attainment start to appear as early as 22 months. We want to make sure that the poorest two-year-olds are given the best start, and subject to Parliamentary approval, have committed to extending free early education with an entitlement for disadvantaged two-year-olds from 2013, funded by an additional £300 million a year by 2014-15. £64m and £223m will be available through the EIG over the next two years so that authorities can build capacity and quality. Local authorities must still have regard to their statutory duties under the Childcare Act 2006 to provide information, training and advice to all providers of early education; quality matters and a highly skilled workforce is critical if we are to have a positive impact on social mobility. c. Short breaks for disabled children. Providing respite to the most vulnerable families improves their outcomes and reduces the cost of care. That is why we have included within the EIG £198m/£202m, at the same time as investing directly in the voluntary and community organisations that support this work. The Early Intervention Grant is of course not limited to these areas. The grant underpins creative local approaches to local priorities, across the whole field of services for children, young people and families. Most Department for Education funding for services for young people will flow through EIG. As we maintain the commitment to raise the participation age to 18 by 2015, the grant will help local authorities to support vulnerable young people to engage in education and training, intervening early with those who are at risk of disengagement. This could include preventing young people from taking part in risky behaviour, like crime, substance misuse or teenage pregnancy, supporting young people at risk of mental health problems, and helping young people who have a learning difficulty or disability to participate and achieve. The grant will support transitional arrangements to ensure that young people have access to impartial careers guidance in advance of the all-age careers service being fully operational. EIG also provides an opportunity for local areas to pursue greater coherence of local services for families with complex needs who face the poorest outcomes and pose the greatest cost to local services. Local authorities will want to consider using EIG funds to support local action in support of the national campaign to improve outcomes for families with multiple and complex problems and reduce costs to welfare and public services. We look forward to Graham Allen’s report on early intervention, which will identify best practice and suggest ways to make it more widespread, including through new funding mechanisms. We recognise that making the transition from the old grant regime, and investing in early intervention at a time when budgets are under pressure, will be demanding. We want to work in partnership with local government to make the case for investment in these vital areas of early intervention. To that end, we will continue to work with the sector, including organisations like C4EO, to develop and disseminate the evidence base. We will promote transparency by working with the sector to measure the key outcomes and incentivise reform and effectiveness through payment of local authorities and providers by results, working with a number of authorities to develop a fair and effective methodology. I am writing to local authority chief executives, directors of children’s services, headteachers and chairs of governing bodies with details of this announcement. Copies of these letters with details of individual school and local authority allocations have been placed in libraries of both houses. Other area-based and specific grants This Government’s decision to prioritise and protect frontline spending on schools and to target local authority spending on vulnerable and deprived children, young people and families has meant that we have had to make some hard choices. As part of the local government announcement, we have confirmed that we are ending a number of education-related area-based and specific grants. The ending of these grants does not mean that we do not see a future role for local authorities in relation to schools. The White Paper, ‘The Importance of Teaching’ - which I recently published - makes clear that local authorities continue to have an important strategic role to play. Local authorities will need to prioritise services and look at opportunities for delivering services more cost effectively including through working in conjunction with other local authorities. In other areas, although the current grants are ending, we do expect to continue to provide funding. The White Paper made clear that we are committed to improving music education. Darren Henley is currently conducting a review of music and we will make announcements about future music funding in the light of recommendations which arise from the review. We want all families to be able to choose the right school for their child. We are therefore reviewing home-to-school transport so that we can better meet the needs of not only disadvantaged families, but all families, ensuring transport is properly targeted to those that need it most. In relation to the grant, which supports extended rights for free home-to-school travel, we will be announcing transition funding in the new year to enable local authorities to continue to deliver their duty in this area for the rest of this academic year, pending the outcome of the review.

The 3 childcare affordability pilots, launched by HMRC and DfE in 2009 are outlined below. The 100% costs pilot offered payment of 100% rather than the standard offer of 80% of childcare costs on entering work for at least 16 hours per week. The primary aim of this research was to ascertain the extent to which childcare costs act as a barrier to parents taking up and sustaining paid work and formal childcare. The actual costs pilot tested the impact of a different system of reporting and payment of the childcare element of working tax credit ( WTC ), but where the total level of support was the same as the current system. The primary aim of the pilot was to assess parents’ experiences and behaviour of claiming under this alternative system. The disabled children’s pilot offered parents of disabled children living in London the opportunity to claim up to 80% of their childcare costs if they went into work for at least 16 hours per week. The research sought to understand the barriers and enablers that existed for parents of disabled children when considering returning to work and taking up childcare."

Lord Heseltine makes a series of recommendations in all aspects of government policy that affect economic growth. The government welcomes this report. The government is accepting in full or in part 81 of Lord Heseltine’s 89 recommendations to dramatically advance the process of decentralisation, unleash the potential of local economies, strengthen partnerships with industry and foster economic growth. This response builds on the significant action the government has already taken to reduce the deficit, restore economic stability and create the conditions for long-term growth. It complements the government’s ambitious supply side growth agenda set out in the Plan for Growth ; the government’s industrial strategy to strengthen partnerships with business; and the series of reforms that the government has pursued in recent Budgets and Autumn Statements. Together with the measures set out in this response, the government has a comprehensive economic plan to create a stronger, more balanced economy. The core proposition of Lord Heseltine’s report is a decentralised approach that breaks Whitehall’s monopoly on resources and decision making, and empowers Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs) to drive forward growth in their local areas. Alongside this, Lord Heseltine makes a number of recommendations that strengthen the underpinnings of long-term growth, from changes to the way in which Whitehall supports growth, to strengthening partnerships between government and business, and business and education."

/government/news/20-million-funding-to-help-children-adopted-from-care,"All schoolchildren adopted from care are to benefit from £20 million of additional pupil premium money to get the support they need to thrive at school - helping around an extra 10,000 pupils. The extension of the funding, worth £1,900 per pupil, will help to close the attainment gap and transform pupil’s future life chances across England. Previously, only children adopted from care since 30 December 2005 were eligible. Children adopted from care do not perform as well as their classmates at school. In 2013, less than half of adopted children reached the expected levels of reading, writing and maths at key stage 2, compared with 75% of non-adopted children. The government is also announcing today (28 July 2014) that 29 councils and voluntary adoption agencies are being given the green light to allow people approved to adopt to search the national Adoption Register from this September. The pilot will allow approved adopters to learn more about the children who are waiting for a loving, stable home. They will be able to find out about their hobbies, likes and dislikes, and hear them speak and laugh in videos and pictures. Opening up the register is designed to ensure that children are placed more quickly with families who can give them the stability and security they deserve. Strict safeguards will be put in place to ensure the safety and privacy of children and approved adopters. Minister for Children and Families, Edward Timpson, who has 2 adopted brothers, said: A child’s needs don’t change overnight just because they are adopted. It is vital that these vulnerable children are given the right support they need and the education they deserve to help them get on in life. Extending the pupil premium to all children adopted will mean they get support they need from day one at school, no matter what their starting point in life. Opening up the Adoption Register, allowing parents approved to adopt to see videos and pictures, to hear the children speak and laugh - while keeping in place the strictest safeguards - will give them a greater role in the process and ensure more children are placed with their new family much more quickly. Sir Martin Narey, government adviser on adoption, said: Sometimes adopter-led matching leads to the adoption of children for whom hope of adoption has almost been abandoned. In their search for a child, adopters sometimes feel a chemistry that makes a child who might not otherwise have been considered for them seem right to them. I warmly applaud the decision to open the register to adopters. More children desperately in need of an adoptive home will now find that home earlier. Last year saw a record 15% increase in adoptions and these announcements, which build on this success, are part of a package of new measures that have come into force today - including: removing barriers to successful matches by ensuring ethnicity is not prioritised by councils and adoption agencies over other factors - such as the ability to provide a loving, stable home placing new rules on councils to actively consider fostering for adoption places where appropriate - allowing children to move in with their potential new adoptive family much earlier putting a new legal duty on all councils to tell adopters about the assistance and support available to them - including access to priority schools admissions for their children, the pupil premium plus, and 15 hours of free early years education for 2-year-olds Isabelle Trowler, Chief Social Worker for Children and Families, said: I welcome opening the register to approved adopters. We need to trust adopters more in deciding which children they can offer a stable and loving home. It will help more children find a permanent family more quickly. Notes to Editors: Based on self-declared adoption data from parents in 2013 , less than half of these adopted children reached the expected levels of reading, writing and maths at key stage 2, compared with 75% of non-adopted children. From April this year children adopted from care under the Adoption and Children Act 2002 (implemented on 30 December 2005) attracted the pupil premium for the first time. The pupil premium has now been extended to cover all children adopted from care which means schools will get extra funding this financial year for pupils adopted before 30 December 2005. The change in eligibility for the pupil premium follows the government’s revised advice to school admission authorities which asks them to give all children adopted from care the highest priority and is part of the government’s wider reform programme to give them the support they need. The pupil premium money will help schools provide tailored support to raise the attainment of all adopted children from this September, such as additional catch-up sessions or specialist training for staff working with children adopted from care. The Adoption Register includes details of children waiting to be adopted and approved prospective adopters referred by adoption agencies, such as further information and pictures of the child. Videos will be available from October. The Adoption Register is currently used by social workers to find homes for children waiting to be adopted. The register is run under contract by the British Association for Adoption and Fostering. 1,345 children and 747 adoptive families were on the Adoption Register as of 1 June 2014. Over 1,040 children in England have been matched by the register since April 2011. Barbara Hutchinson, interim CEO , British Association for Fostering and Adoption, said: “Evidence from other adopter-led initiatives has shown that when given better information, approved adopters will often consider children whom they would otherwise not consider. This could be particularly beneficial for those children who are currently seen as ‘harder to place’, and yet so desperately need a loving home.The register has always been at the forefront of adopter-led initiatives and we believe that adopter access to the register will both increase the speed of matching, and enable more matches to be made.” The local authorities taking part in the pilot are: Barnet Blackburn with Darwen Camden Cheshire East Ealing Enfield Essex Gloucestershire Hackney Haringey Islington North Tyneside Poole Shropshire Stockport Tameside Telford & Wrekin Trafford York The voluntary adoption agencies taking part in the pilot are: Action for Children (Mosaic) Adoption Matters North West After Adoption Caritas Care Coram (London and East Midlands) DFW Adoption Faith in Families Families for Children Parents and Children Together Yorkshire Adoption Agency The pilots will begin on the 1 September 2014 and will run for 9 months.

/government/speeches/elizabeth-truss-speaks-about-how-schools-can-support-parents,"Thanks very much. It’s great to be here at CityFathers and CityMothers - CityParents. And I’m very impressed by the rate of growth in your organisation since last year. As we all know, parenting is one of the most important jobs any of us will ever do. And not just for mothers - it’s a job for both parents. Apart from actually giving birth - which women haven’t yet managed to delegate, despite Arnold Schwarzenegger films suggesting otherwise - fathers face just the same challenges and dilemmas as mothers, and it’s very important for both parents to be involved in their children’s lives. In defence of parents Sometimes it feels as though the whole issue of parenthood has never been more fraught. The debate swings between blaming parents for all society’s problems - for being too focused on their own careers and neglecting their children, letting them run riot and play computer games late into the night. Or it blames them for being too obsessed with their own offspring - painting an unfair and untrue picture of entitled mums and dads ramming their Bugaboos into pedestrians, clogging up the streets on the school run and hogging all the best spaces in supermarket car parks. The reality - of course - is that neither of these gargoyle stereotypes is true. In fact parents today are working harder than ever, spending more time with their children than ever, and worrying more and more about how to help their child succeed. Across the developed world, the trend is increasingly for dual-income families. Sixty per cent of families in the OECD have 2 parents in work - and about two-thirds of mothers in the UK are in paid employment. But that doesn’t mean they’re not working hard at home as well. This generation of working parents with young children spends more time on childcare than stay-at-home parents did in the 1970s. And stay-at-home parents are devoting more time to their children. According to the Multinational Time Use Study in 2005, employed women spent an average of 97 minutes per day with their children below the age of 4 - 20 minutes more than non-working mothers did in 1974. So we should all speak in defence of parents and the work they do - and regardless of where they live or what they do, all the parents I meet have one thing in common. They’re really concerned about their children’s welfare; about how they’re getting on at school, and whether they’re happy; about whether they’ll get good grades, get a good job and get on the housing ladder. Institutions to fit the modern world Because as we all know, the world is getting more and more competitive. The globe is shrinking, and people hop from continent to continent for work, study, and travel - while the relentless march of technology is transforming our jobs, our homes, and our lives. Mostly, for the better. The internet has brought the world to our desk and our door; we can talk to people on the other side of the globe instantly, for free; the employment market is much more fluid, and much more dynamic, and people can increasingly move in and out of jobs and careers, of full-time and part-time and flexible work. As more basic tasks are automated or robotised, human intelligence and skill is more important than ever, and many of our jobs are getting fuller and more interesting. It’s easy sometimes to take our world of limitless opportunities for granted. Remember when 4 TV channels felt like unimaginable luxury? When getting sports results on Ceefax was like magic? When everyone had to carry a London A to Z to have any hope of getting around? We now rely on technology. But modern life can also be tiring. When you can communicate instantly, the speed of life and of work increases exponentially - and with emails, BlackBerrys, mobiles, wifi, we are ‘always on’ and always frenetic. All too often, corporate culture rewards the person who stays longer and later - regardless of whether they’re actually doing the best job and delivering the best outcomes. Look at my workplace - the ultimate example of presenteeism, where you have to show up in person to walk through a lobby and vote at 10pm. Our workplaces - our institutions - need to adapt to the world we live in. Too often they are saddled with the cultural assumptions of the past. They need to focus more on the work employees do, and the results they achieve, than the hours they spend in the office. That would be better for the economy - and better for all of us. Education ever more important And, above all, it would be better for our children. Because if the world feels fast now - just imagine how much faster it will feel in 20 or 30 years’ time. Our children will face competition from the rising, hungry nations of the world; will do jobs we can’t even imagine, working in ways we can’t predict. The one thing we know is that education and skills will only become more crucial. The correlation between international test scores at age 15 and economic growth has already increased by a third in the last few decades. And we know that other countries and regions are racing ahead. Fifteen-year-olds in Shanghai are already 3 years ahead of those in this country in maths. And those in Poland are one year ahead. That’s why education and childcare go hand in hand. We need to support parents and also give children the best start in life. That’s why this government is doing everything possible to drive up standards in schools and help every child reach their full potential. Of course we also want rounded, creative, innovative youngsters - who are resilient and can handle change. Just this weekend, I published new guidance helping teachers to identify and support young people suffering from underlying mental health problems - meaning healthier, happier classrooms. Schools to support modern life And we’re determined to make schools become institutions that work better with modern life - that prepare children for all the challenges of the modern world, and support and help families. That’s why Michael Gove announced earlier this year that he wants state schools - just like independent schools - to offer a school day 9 or 10 hours long, and we will support schools to do this. Not necessarily for extra lessons - but for a safe, calm place to do homework, or to go over classes which you didn’t get the first time round; time for clubs like debating, cadets, orchestras, sport and drama, for volunteering or careers talks from employers - all the sort of enrichment activities which our best schools already offer as a matter of course. And I’m pleased to say that new research from the DfE shows that last year around half of all primaries in England - almost 10,000 schools - were offering care both before and after school during term time, breakfast clubs, homework clubs, and so on. Sixty-four per cent of all English primary schools provided access to before school care, 70% provided access to after school care and 19% provided access to holiday care. And before and after school care is actually most common in schools in the most deprived areas - helping to give children who need it a better start in life. Seventy-three per cent of primary schools in the most deprived areas run before-school activities, for example, compared with just 61% in the rest of the country. Of course, for parents who work, an extended school day makes balancing care and career much easier. At the moment, the school day normally runs from 9 to 3 - meaning that any parent whose work day runs beyond these hours is completely stuck. By extending that day, parents can spend less time fretting about getting out of work on time - and spend more time together as a family. Academies already have the freedom to extend the school day - and many are using that freedom to achieve brilliant results. Like Great Yarmouth Primary School, in Norfolk. Until September 2012, this was Greenacre Primary - one of the worst schools in the country, in special measures after it was condemned by inspectors in 2010 as failing. Under the expert stewardship of the Inspiration Trust, led by Theodore Agnew and Dame Rachel de Souza, and the fantastic leadership of head Bill Holledge, it was reopened as an academy in 2012 - open until 5 or 6pm most evenings, offering pupils a free programme of after school activities, from horseriding and cookery to sport, drama and music, along with supervised homework sessions. Just last week, it was rated good with outstanding leadership by Ofsted - an incredible turnaround. As the Ofsted report said, “enrichment activities and study sessions provided as part of the mandatory extended day increase pupils’ self confidence, life skills and engagement in learning. They contribute to the pupils’ improving achievement.” School-based nurseries As well as wanting to see more schools offer that sort of provision, we also want more schools to reach down the age range and offer nurseries for 2-, 3- and 4-year-olds as well. Like Evelyn Street Primary School in Warrington - a school of about 200 pupils between 2 and 11, rated outstanding by Ofsted. Their nursery already has 52 places for 3- and 4-year-olds. Now, it’s started offering 16 places to 2-year-olds as well, which are already in high demand. As far as parents are concerned, it’s one joined up service. Nursery care is available from 8am to 6pm. Parents can choose the times they need, and use their funded hours for any of them, topping up with paid-for care if necessary, getting really high-quality, teacher-led nursery care. And Evelyn Street is managing to provide this at two-thirds of the average childcare cost in the North West because they share so many of the costs with the school. And they’re achieving great results. Because children and parents engage with school much earlier, both attainment and behaviour are noticeably better, particularly among the most vulnerable children. The idea of using our schools better has growing support from all political parties - in fact, just last week, Margaret Hodge MP said that: The sensible policy direction would have been to locate more and more of our childcare offer in schools rather than build other buildings partly because it would be more sustainable, partly because it would make better use of valuable community assets and [is] where people feel comfortable, and partly because it brings the influence of the education community to bear on the quality of childcare provision. We know that there’s huge demand from parents - and already, the school census shows that in January 2013, 5,358 state-funded mainstream primary schools recorded themselves as having ‘nursery-type’ school classes - over 30% of the total. So we’ve made it easier than ever for every school to open a nursery for the whole day from 8am to 6pm. Over the last year, 49 schools all over the country planning and delivering places for 2-year-olds - both in the country and in cities - have been helping us to work out how we can make it easier for more schools to offer places to 2-year-olds. It’s been a huge success. Three-quarters of their in-house school nurseries are already full up. And while the traditional nurseries that we’ve got at the moment only offer care for half the day at most, 4 out of 5 of these new model school nurseries are now offering full-time care, in both the morning and the afternoon, making life much easier for parents who work full time. Because these nurseries are based on the same site as schools, they can work much more closely together - sharing breakfast, after school and holiday clubs, and providing continuity from early education into education. Many of the people in this room may think that 8am to 6pm doesn’t work with their schedules. So we’re also introducing childminder agencies from this September, giving much greater flexibility. One of them, for example, will be operating within a school, offering a seamless, flexible service to parents. By offering cover and quality assurance, childminder agencies provide a one-stop shop - while making it much easier for more people to become childminders and work with both schools and parents. Better for parents As far as parents are concerned, schools can offer one, joined up, flexible offer - meaning that parents can choose the services they need, and pay for them with government-funded hours, our new Tax-Free Childcare worth £2,000 per child per year, their own money, or both. And by using our school facilities better, we can get much better value for money and a better integrated service. So we want many more schools to get involved. We’re speaking to all the big academy chains, encouraging them to lead the way, linking with private nurseries to provide the best offer to parents. And we’re also working with children’s centres - which offer early help and are based in the most deprived areas - are now reaching out to more parents. We’ve just had some very good results last week that 90% of eligible parents are now registered by children’s centres, and 90 to 98% are very or fairly satisfied with the services they received, including activities like breastfeeding support and parent/baby classes. Conclusion In this room we’ve got a group of pioneers, demanding a culture change from their workplaces to focus on outcomes, not presenteeism. In the same way, we should also demand a culture change in the schools. Next time you are in your child’s school, if they don’t already, ask them whether they’re planning to offer 8 to 6 provision - ask whether they’re going to extend their age range downwards, and welcome 2-, 3- and 4-year-olds to be part of the school family. We all need to be asking those questions of our schools. We know that the world has changed since we were children - and parenting has changed along with it. Our institutions need to change too. They need to work with us, and support us. In the workplace and the playground, the office and the classroom, we need our institutions to support and help family life - helping parents, helping children, helping our whole society. Thank you."
/government/news/parents-to-be-given-new-freedoms-to-run-their-local-childrens-centres,"18 more local authorities to trial payment by results in children’s centres Parents and communities are to be given the freedom to run their local children’s centre, under new plans announced today. The Government will consult in the autumn on changes to children’s centres, including proposals that will enable parents and community groups to apply to their local authority to run a children’s centre in their local area. Under the plans, local authorities, not the Government, would have the final say on whether projects go ahead. The Government also confirmed today that a further 18 local authorities will trial payment by results for children’s centres. Together with the first wave announced in July, 27 local authorities will be testing rewards for reaching the most vulnerable families, improving family health and wellbeing and raising attainment of children at age five. As part of wider reforms to the core purpose of children’s centres, the Government wants to see a clearer focus on reaching the most disadvantaged families and more work to help narrow the attainment gap between wealthier and poorer children that is evident from as early as 22 months. Children’s Minister Sarah Teather said: Children’s centres are at the heart of community life. New proposals to enable parents and communities to help run children’s centres will give local people more control and influence over the services they use on a daily basis. We know many children’s centres are doing fantastic work, but there is still more to be done to reach the poorest families. Children’s centres are a powerful tool in tackling social inequality and we want to make sure they are giving children, regardless of background, the chance to develop well and be ready for school. That’s why I’m pleased to announce a further 18 areas will be trialling a new way of working - looking at how we can reward children’s centres for improving outcomes for families. We are putting a particular focus on disadvantaged families getting the help they need in children’s centres, and on ensuring that every child develops well and starts school ready and able to learn. To help children’s centres improve their outreach services, the Department for Education will be working with the National College to recruit three regional outreach leaders. The leaders will work alongside the National College’s Foundation Years Associates, to support and advise children’s centres across the country. Their role will be to help share best practice and advocate effective approaches to targeting the most disadvantaged families. In July, the Department published a new vision for Families in the Foundation Years, which set out plans to reform children’s centres. This included funding for new ‘early years teaching centres’ to help strengthen the early years workforce. The Government can today announce that 16 children’s centres and nurseries have been selected as ‘early years teaching centres’. Pen Green Research Base in Corby will be leading this work. The centres will aim to raise standards and improve children’s outcomes, working with foundation years providers within their local area. The Department and the National College will work closely with Pen Green to ensure learning from these 16 centres is shared widely. Notes to editors The Government will be consulting on changes to Sure Start statutory guidance and changes to governance arrangements for children’s centres later in the year. The Government announced in July the first nine areas who would be trialing payment by results . The further 17 trials (in 18 local authorities) announced today are: Bolton Brent Buckinghamshire Calderdale Darlington East Riding and North Yorkshire (joint trial) Hertfordshire Knowsley Lambeth Lewisham Lincolnshire Liverpool Plymouth Portsmouth Shropshire Swindon Wirral The 16 children’s centres and nurseries to become ‘early years teaching centres’ are below (these are the lead centres, some are working with consortia of other providers): Rowland Hill Nursery School and CC, Haringey Mary Paterson Nursery School, Westminster Eastwood Nursery School Centre, Wandsworth Maytree Nursery School and CC, Lambeth Martinscroft Nursery School and CC, Manchester Fairfield Children’s Centre, Lancashire Hungerford Nursery School, West Berkshire The ACE CC and Nursery School, Oxford Bognor Regis Nursery School and CC, West Sussex Bluecoat Children’s Centre and Nursery School, Devon Redcliffe Children’s Centre, Bristol City Allens Croft Children’s Centre, Birmingham Warwickshire consortium of nursery schools and CCs, Warwickshire St Edmund’s Nursery School and CC, Bradford Clifton Children’s Centre, Kingston upon Hull Pen Green Children’s Centre, (additional centre, Northamptonshire) [Contact:997] Website: www.education.gov.uk/help/contactus"

/government/news/response-to-telegraph-story-on-the-erosion-of-childhood,"The Telegraph ran a story on 24th September when 200 academics, teachers, authors and charity leaders wrote to the Telegraph claiming that: the ‘erosion’ of childhood has increased apace over last few years children are exposed to ‘too much, too soon’ children are subjected to too many commercial pressures children start formal education younger than norm in Europe. Children’s Minister Sarah Teather said: The recent report from UNICEF brought into stark focus the pressure on childhood in the UK. We share these concerns - children should be allowed to be children. Business and regulators are leading the way by implementing recommendations from Reg Bailey’s review to help tackle the commercialisation and sexualisation of children. More broadly, we know that supporting strong, stable families is one of the best ways we can give children a happy childhood. We want mums and dads to be able to balance work and family life, that’s why we are extending parental leave and rights to flexible working. For those who want a bit more advice and information on parenting, we will shortly be trialling an offer of parenting classes in some areas. We are also reforming the early years curriculum to simplify the number of targets children are assessed against at five, as well as placing more emphasis on getting children ready for school - ready to make friends, listen and share, and say what they think. Government can only do so much. As a society, we all have a stake in making sure there is time for family life and children are free to cherish their childhoods. [Contact:997]"
/government/publications/results-of-the-early-years-foundation-stage-profile-pilot,"A new early years foundation stage profile ( EYFSP ) was introduced in September 2012. The new profile made changes to the way children are assessed at the end of the EYFS (the end of academic year in which a child turns five). This report describes the results of the EYFSP pilot which took place in the summer term of 2012 to support the introduction of the new profile from September. The pilot involved a sample of approximately 500 schools across 19 local authorities. Reception teachers in the sample schools assessed the children in their class using the then-current profile as well as the new profile, resulting in assessment data for approximately 20,000 children. We also collected feedback from the teachers involved using a range of methods. A sub-sample of 118 reception class teachers were selected to test the moderation arrangements and to give detailed feedback on the draft guidance and exemplification materials."

/government/news/press-briefing-morning-18-march-2013,"Leveson Asked about the cross party agreement on press regulation, the PMS said that the agreed royal charter enshrined a non-legislative approach to press regulation and avoided the risks of statutory underpinning of press regulation. The parties had agreed to insert a ‘no change’ clause for royal charters into the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Bill, which would apply to all royal charters from 1 March 2013. A revised charter would be published in due course to reflect the amendments made from the version published by the PM the previous week. The PM thought that the agreed approach was the right one and would also unblock the legislative programme. Asked for detail on the cross party talks, the PMS said that talks had included discussions at ministerial and party leader level over several weeks. The Minister for Government Policy had represented the government in final talks the previous evening, with the PM being kept in close touch. Childcare Asked whether the government was going to make an announcement on childcare, the PMS said that the government was going to bring forward proposals in due course.

Education Minister Liz Truss had set out the government’s position in the House; the important issue was how to improve access to high quality childcare. The UK had some of the most expensive childcare provision in Europe as well as one of the tightest ratios between children and carers. Lynton Crosby Asked whether Lynton Crosby had any influence over the content of the Queen’s Speech, the PMS said that he did not. Lynton Crosby was employed by the Conservative Party and issues relating to his appointment were an issue for them. Economy Asked whether the PM was pleased with progress made with the economy, the PMS said that the PM believed the economy was healing but as the Chancellor had said, it remains a long road which would not be smooth. Russia and Syria Questioned on the PM’s trip to Russia and discussions on Syria, the PMS said that the PM would meet President Putin ahead of the G8 meeting and would discuss a range of issues including Syria. Russia was an important part of the international community and was an important contributor regarding discussions on Syria. The UK was exploring all options as part of putting political pressure on the Assad regime. Asked about the use of chemical weapons, the PMS said he would not comment on intelligence issues, but the assessment was that chemical weapons were very likely to have been initiated by the regime. There was no evidence of rebel use. IPSA Asked to comment on the court proceedings IPSA were taking against Stewart Jackson MP, the PMS said that IPSA was independent.

/government/news/future-of-education-inspection-regional-launch-events,"From September 2015, Ofsted is making far-reaching changes to the way it inspects schools, further education and skills (FES) and early years provision. To give education leaders and practitioners from these sectors an opportunity to learn more about the changes Ofsted is holding a series of eight national launch events during June and July (these events are now fully booked) and will be making the event materials available on GOV.UK. These will cover the two key changes: the new Common Inspection Framework and how it will impact on settings on the Early Years Register, maintained schools and academies, non-association independent schools and further education and skills providers Ofsted’s new frequent, shorter inspections for maintained schools, academies and FES providers judged good at their last full inspection Below are the dates of the national launch events. Please note: due to high demand the events are now fully booked. If you are interested in attending future events please email inspectionreform@ofsted.gov.uk .

This enables settings to be inspected to an equal set of standards and will ensure consistency and an improved ability to compare different types of provision. Inspectors will make 4 graded judgements on the same areas across all remits: effectiveness of leadership and management quality of teaching, learning and assessment personal development, behaviour and welfare outcomes for children and learners There will be a greater emphasis on safeguarding, the quality of early learning, the breadth of the curriculum in schools and the relevance of courses and training in FES. Ofsted will deliver frequent, shorter inspections for schools, academies and FES providers judged good at their last inspection. These will take place approximately every 3 years and will provide an opportunity for greater professional dialogue between inspectors and leaders. They will focus on whether the quality of the provision is being sustained and leaders have the capacity to drive improvement. These inspections will allow Ofsted to identify decline early. They will also give schools and providers which are improving the opportunity to demonstrate this improvement to Ofsted sooner. Ofsted will set a new baseline by inspecting all non-association independent schools under the new CIF and against the revised independent school standards within the next 3 years. Ofsted is also taking steps to improve how we inspect. From September 2015, it will contract directly with inspectors for schools, non-association independent schools and further education and skills and we will also increase the number of current practitioners on inspections teams. This will enable Ofsted have the necessary quality, control and flexibility in its workforce to deliver its reforms and give education professionals who choose to become Ofsted Inspectors the opportunity for peer review, continuous professional development, training and experience of inspection. Ofsted believes that these changes to the way it inspects and to its inspection workforce will drive even greater consistency, quality and impact in its inspection.

/government/news/sure-start-childrens-centres-statutory-guidance,"The government is committed to Sure Start Children’s Centres. Children’s centres play a crucial role in early intervention, ensuring families can get help when they need it, tackling issues early and helping to prevent costly problems from emerging later on. The Government wants the network of children’s centres to be retained but focused much more effectively on those families who need them the most. We have ensured there is enough money in the system through the new Early Intervention Grant (EIG) to keep the network of children’s centres. Local authorities continue to have duties under the Childcare Act 2006 to consult before opening, closing or significantly changing children’s centres, and to secure sufficient provision to meet local need so far as is reasonably practicable. Statutory guidance (published in March 2010) accompanies these duties, which outlines how the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Act 2009 provisions relate to children’s centres. The statutory guidance advises local authorities, primary care trusts and Jobcentre Plus on the action they should take to comply with their duties. Although the delivery context has changed, these duties remain current. The guidance will be particularly useful to local authorities, as they work with their local communities to plan future children’s centre provision. The following sections of the guidance are particularly relevant: Section 5A of the Act: The duty to make sufficient provision of children’s centres to meet local need, so far as is reasonably practicable - pages 7-8 of the guidance, which emphasises that local authorities should ensure universal access to children’s centres is achieved and all children and families can be reached effectively, especially the most deprived. Section 5D: The duty to consult before establishing, significantly changing or closing a children’s centre - pages 15-18 of the guidance, which emphasises that local authorities should allow adequate time for responses, actively encourage parents from disadvantaged groups to participate, and demonstrate in their decision how they have taken consultation responses into account. We are now working with a range of partners to develop a new shared vision for early years, which is to be published as a policy statement later in the year. In the meantime, please note that some parts of the statutory guidance do not reflect recent policy developments. Reminder on claw-back Claw-back of funding is triggered where an asset funded wholly or partly by DfE is disposed of, or the asset is no longer used to meet the aims and objectives consistent with the Sure Start Early Years and Childcare Grant (SSEYCG) or Aiming High for Disabled Children Grant (AHDC). Local authorities must notify the Department for Education of any plans to dispose of grant funded assets. Local authorities should operate on the presumption that claw-back will be enforced. However, subject to prior approval from the DfE, claw-back may be waived or deferred where an asset is sold and the proceeds are reinvested in another asset for a similar purpose consistent with the aims of the grant. Disposal means a sale, transfer, or change of use of a capital asset. It includes the transfer of ownership of a lease, or freehold assets. Further information on the disposal of assets and invocation of claw-back can be found in paragraphs 33 to 45 of the Capital Guidance . [Contact:997]"

/government/news/munro-review-of-child-protection-government-response,"The Government today published its response to Professor Eileen Munro’s recommendations to reform the child protection system, set out earlier this year. The response outlines the Government’s intention, working with professionals, to build a system focused on the needs, views and experiences of vulnerable children. The Government will reduce central regulation and prescription and place greater trust and responsibility in skilled professionals and local leaders to bring about long-term reform. Today the Children’s Minister Tim Loughton has outlined the changes in a letter to all schools, Directors of Children’s Services and early years’ providers. He has also written a joint letter with Anne Milton, Minister for Public Health, to all local health services, and with Lynne Featherstone, Minister for Equalities and Criminal Information, to police forces. Ministers see these professionals as central to leading the reforms. The Government’s ambition is for a child protection system that truly values and acts on the feedback of children, young people and their families. Ministers agree with Professor Munro that the current system is overly focused on complying with procedures and targets as a measure of success. The new approach is based on developing professional expertise and providing a range of help and services to children and families that meet all their needs. Children’s Minister Tim Loughton said: Today’s response is the first stage of a journey which will fundamentally change the child protection system - we’re not just tinkering at the edges and fixing short term problems. We are freeing hardworking social workers and other professionals from structures, procedures and rulebooks so they can do their best for vulnerable children and their families. This is a new mindset and a new relationship between central Government and local services. I am determined that we build on the excellent work of Professor Munro and I trust the workforce to deliver the reforms without working to prescription. We have worked openly and collaboratively with professionals and children’s leaders to create reforms that are sustainable in the long term. The Government is not in the business of telling local services how to implement the reforms - as has happened in the past - because this has been shown by Professor Munro to result in unintended consequences. The changes will take time to fully implement. We have outlined some key milestones so that we keep up momentum and ensure that the process is advanced by next year. I am confident that working together we will give more of our children a safe and happy childhood. Professor Munro will continue to advise the Government and will undertake an interim assessment of progress next year. Professor Eileen Munro, Professor of Social Policy at the London School of Economics said: This is the start of a reform process to move the focus of help and protection firmly onto children and young people and away from compliance with excessive bureaucratic demands. It is time to give professionals more freedom and responsibility for improving their skills in helping children and young people. The presence and influence of professionals working with the Government is crucial in delivering the reforms in the longer term. An Implementation Working Group, drawing on expertise from local authority children’s services, social workers, education, police and the health service, advised the Government on its response to Professor Munro’s report. The response includes the following actions by the Government: A radical reduction in the amount of central regulation and locally designed rules and procedures. Slimmed down statutory guidance in the interim by December 2011 including removing timescales for assessments and removing the distinction between initial and core assessment. A Chief Social Worker to provide a permanent professional presence for social work in Government, to cover children and adults, in place by the end of 2012. The Department for Education to establish a joint programme of work with the Department of Health by September 2011 to make sure children’s safeguarding is a central consideration of the health reforms. Undertake further work with the sector to consider the evidence and opportunities for using systems review methodology for Serious Case Reviews (SCRs) to help all local services properly learn the lessons from SCRs. Actions for local services to implement include: Local authorities to appoint a practising senior social worker as a Principal Child and Family Social Worker. Local services to increase the range and number of preventative services and to provide families with an ‘early help offer’. Local authorities to assess and redesign child and family social services, based on feedback from children and families. The Government is clear that with greater freedoms come greater accountability. Therefore there are several actions in the plan to improve inspection. These include: All local services - health, education, police, probation and the justice system - to be inspected on how well they protect children. The experiences of children and families to be at the heart of Ofsted’s inspection system, looking at how effective the help has been rather than whether certain processes have been met. Ministers have agreed to extend ongoing trials to give social workers greater autonomy so they can better exercise their professional judgment. Current trials in Westminster, Knowsley, Cumbria and Hackney have seen social workers completing assessments within timescales that they think would meet children’s needs better. The current trials will now run to December 2011, and be extended to five Community Budget areas - Hull, Kensington and Chelsea, Hammersmith and Fulham, Wandsworth and Swindon. Evidence will be used to inform changes to the statutory guidance on assessment. Corinne May-Chahal, interim chair of The College of Social Work, said: The Munro Review concentrated on the importance of focussing on the experience of children as they come into contact with the child protection system. Social workers have wanted to do this for many years but unnecessary bureaucracy, unhelpful timescales and poor ICT systems have made that difficult. The review proposes developing a learning culture in child protection, rather than a blame culture, valuing the knowledge and capabilities of social workers and of their health and education partners. The government’s response demonstrates a new understanding of the realities of child protection and the need for improvement to be led by social workers and those that employ them. The College of Social Work welcomes this and knows that change of this magnitude takes time. We are ready to support social workers and their employers to meet the challenges involved in taking the reforms forward. Matt Dunkley, Director of Children’s Services in East Sussex, said: My personal reflection is to strongly welcome the collaborative and transparent way in which the Minister has worked with the sector to formulate the Government’s response to Professor Munro’s Review. There will be significant challenges in the transition to the locally determined and professionally-led approach to child protection it promises, but with the same collaboration, trust and transparency, I believe we have a good chance of making it a reality.

/government/publications/fairer-schools-funding-arrangements-for-2015-to-2016,"The documents on this page provide information about schools funding arrangements for 2015 to 2016. This includes how the Department for Education will allocate an additional £390 million to increase the per-pupil funding of the least fairly funded local authority areas in England. ‘Fairer Schools Funding: Arrangements for 2015 to 2016’ describes how funding will be allocated by setting minimum funding levels that every local authority will attract for their pupils and schools. It also sets out arrangements for simplifying the administration of academies funding and minor changes to high needs funding and the way schools contribute to the carbon reduction commitment. ‘Annex C: Local Authority Schools Block Units of Funding 2015 to 2016’ confirms each local authority’s schools block unit of funding for 2015 to 2016. The technical note explains how we calculated the funding. The operational guide provides detailed information and guidance for local authorities and schools explaining the changes we made to funding arrangements for 2015 to 2016."
/government/speeches/michael-gove-to-the-local-government-association,"Thank you Councillor David for that kind introduction. And thank you - not just for staying right until the very end of your conference for which I do owe you a special debt of gratitude, but also for the invaluable public service that you provide to your communities and the contribution that you make, in turn, to our country. So many of the services on which our citizens rely depend on the vision, leadership and sheer hard work of people in local government. And yet far too often local councillors and officials aren’t recognised, thanked and applauded for their commitment to public service. No one becomes a councillor for the money, and no one works in local government for the glamour but without you our country would be less safe, less just and less civilised. So thank you all. Let me also thank the LGA for the leadership that it provides on your behalf. Under the chairmanship of Dame Margaret Eaton and in particular through the Children and Young People’s Board led by Baroness Ritchie, the LGA has consistently campaigned for Whitehall to provide more support to councils to improve children’s services, and also to relinquish more control to councils over education issues. The latest example is the excellent report, ‘Local freedom or central control’, which the LGA published on Tuesday. The examples of good practice it cites, and the evidence of great leadership you provide underline the crucial role you have to play in helping us all make opportunity more equal in our society. A commitment to extending opportunity, and greater social justice, is at the heart of what our new Coalition Government wants to achieve. And let me say that the confidence I have that our coalition can work successfully in the national interest stems from the proven success of the coalitions we have delivering for people in local Government. Whether in Birmingham or Leeds, coalitions - built on the principle of honest partnership - can bring real benefits. Policies can be explored and discussed more rigorously and a consensual style in town halls can generate a fruitful partnership beyond and across communities. And because this coalition Government has partnership at its heart I want to ensure the partnership between central and local Government is stronger than ever. We need to listen, and learn, from your experience. We need to consult with you as the people who deliver and champion you as the generators of success. That is why my department will set up new, robust, arrangements to allow local authority leaders - elected members and officials - a central role in helping to shape the future. And in that spirit of honest partnership, can I apologise to you as I apologised to the House of Commons yesterday for the confusion that arose following my statement about Building Schools for the Future on Monday? One of the reasons I wanted to change the way in which capital was allocated is because I believe the old BSF way shut out local communities, was insufficiently respectful of the expertise you have, and was wasteful of the limited resources you have at your disposal. It required you to invest in procurement costs and consultancy rather than bricks and mortar, teachers and classroom assistants. And I was aware even before we entered Government of the desire to have a system of capital allocation which placed much more power in local hands. That is what I have asked my review team to deliver. But in setting the direction of a new policy I believe is right and necessary I failed, and it was my failure, to provide totally accurate information on a school-by-school basis about which schools would be affected. I’m the person responsible, and accountable, for that and I do apologise. I wish in particular to apologise to people in those local authorities such as Sandwell, who are doing such a great job, where schools were wrongly informed their rebuilding would proceed under BSF when, sadly, it will not. I want to apologise to them unreservedly. But I also want to stress that the end of this method of allocating capital does not mean the end of new school building. My department will work with you to identify how we can allocate capital more quickly and fairly in future, I have asked an experienced local Government chief executive, Barry Quirk, to help us and our thinking will be shaped by your needs. Many schools, including in areas where BSF has been halted, will receive capital in due course for refurbishment and rebuilding. Making sure that money was in your hands more effectively has always been my aim and that is the principle which will guide our policy-making. Children’s services Whatever mistakes I may have made, or may make, one thing I’m certain of is that I have a great team of ministers who are all, individually and collectively, doing a great job. Nick Gibb in the Commons and Jonathan Hill in the Lords lead for us on schools. And my deputy in the Department - with explicit responsibility for Children and Families - is Sarah Teather. Many of you may know Sarah, as a former councillor, great campaigner and thoughtful, sensitive shaper of policy. I count myself incredibly fortunate to have her dealing with some of the most sensitive, delicate and important issues with which our department deals. And I am really glad that alongside her we have Tim Loughton, another MP who has benefited from time in local government, who has devoted his career in the House of Commons to children’s issues. Both of them appreciate that there is no more important or sensitive role in local government than exercising responsibility for children’s services. Sarah is deeply committed to improving our support for families and ensuring that children get off to the best start in life. That is why she announced on Tuesday that Clare Tickell, the Chief Executive of Action for Children, will lead a review of the Early Years Foundation Stage that will aim to free up early years professionals in nurseries, children’s centres and playgroups to work with young children. She has also announced that, this year, we will extend free childcare for three- and four year-olds to 15 hours a week year and announced that we will fund early learning and childcare for more than 20,000 of the most disadvantaged two-year-olds. And we are determined to do more to target services at the poorest families, including by expanding the number of health visitors. Tim is leading our work to improve transparency across children’s services and place greater trust in frontline professionals. We want to learn the lessons of what has gone wrong in the past so we can keep children safer in the future. That is why Tim has announced that Professor Eileen Munro will lead an independent review of children’s social work and frontline child protection practice. It will build on the work undertaken by the Social Work Task Force under the leadership of Moira Gibb and will look specifically at how we can strengthen frontline practice by removing the barriers and bureaucracy which prevent social workers spending valuable time with vulnerable children. And while the safety of vulnerable children is, of course, paramount, we must take a measured approach that allows children to be protected but does not consider every person who comes into contact with them as a risk. That is why we will end ContactPoint as soon as is practicable and have also halted registration for the existing Vetting and Barring Scheme. New solutions that better support practitioners and the public will be developed in their place. In all of these areas, local authorities are playing the leading implementation role. Many are doing an excellent job, but it is also the case that some areas have been found wanting. While there are of course issues with the inspection framework that must be addressed, this is naturally concerning. But I am clear that the knowledge and expertise that we need to drive further improvement can only be found in the sector itself and our job is to ensure that it can be properly harnessed, including by continuing to bear down on bureaucracy and by helping you to increase your capacity for improvement through organisations like C4EO and the National College. Local vision And just as I believe strong local government leaders are the best people to drive improvement in local government children’s services departments so I believe great leaders and teachers in our schools are the best people to lead the improvement drive we need in our education system. In the LGA report I mentioned earlier, Dame Margaret writes: Councils don’t run schools and haven’t done for many years. What local government does is make sure there are enough school places for all the children who need them. It makes sure the admissions process operates fairly so that every child gets a chance to go to a good local school, and oversees the distribution of funding in a cost-effective way. Councils provide support for all children with special education needs and are also the champions of children in care. And she is right. Local councils must be champions for parents and children in the local area. After all, that is the right role for any democratically elected council and it is the one that they are best placed to play. First, by ‘holding the ring’ on admissions and exclusions. We believe that promoting greater parental choice helps to improve standards for all children and this means there needs to be sufficient school places. As you know only too well, making sure there are enough school places for every child this year, next year and in the years ahead will be a challenge. You have the primary role in ensuring that schools adhere to the admissions code and we want to do all that we can to ensure that you work closely with the Office of the Schools Adjudicator to ensure that fair admissions arrangements are in place in every area. You are also responsible for ensuring that schools take their fair share of the hardest to place pupils and for commissioning suitable alternative provision. Second, by being consistent local champions for social justice. Our first priority must be raising the attainment of the poorest. That is why I am proud that at the heart of our Coalition’s programme for Government is a commitment to spending more on the education of the poorest through our pupil premium. Local government has the critical role in tackling disadvantage at root by advocating on behalf of children in care, supporting schools in strategies to make sure every child arrives to start the school day ready to learn, bringing together local partners and agencies to provide extra support and ensuring that the needs of pupils with special educational needs and their parents are met. Third, by taking ownership of school improvement across your local areas. The London Challenge and the Black Country Challenge drove improvement in education but some I know felt they were perhaps too prescriptively designed by the centre. When the National Challenge was launched, it maintained the impetus for improvement but again the feeling was that the centre was driving too much, leaving local communities out of the picture. I understand those concerns, although I also firmly believe that floor targets have helped to focus attention on driving improvement in the lowest achieving schools. I now want to see more ambitious expectations set for achievement in our education system. And those are not expectations that I will set centrally. You are the first in line to tackle failure where it exists. And we in the centre have a backstop power that means we will step in and take control of the worst-performing schools where there is no sign of improvement. But I want you to have a vision for improvement across all schools in your area, including those schools whose results seem perfectly acceptable on the surface but which are coasting. I would like to see Northamptonshire Challenges, or County Durham Challenges in which local communities agree the level and pace of improvement they want to see in the academic achievement of young people in their area. My job is to provide you with the right incentives. I am particularly attracted to the kind of approach taken by President Obama in America through the Race to the Top programme, under which states come forward with proposals for improvement that might include bringing in outside providers, stronger collaboration between schools or imaginative proposals on CPD for teachers, and rewards are offered to the best ideas. And we will look closely at how we can recreate this kind of competition in our country. Dialogue I know that the vision that I have set out raises questions. Questions about the powers that you need to fulfil your responsibilities. About funding. About the speed of travel, the inspection framework and how health services and other partners will support you. I can’t answer all of these questions today. And nor is it right that I try to. None of them have easy answers and many of them have potentially serious implications for us, for you and for people around the country. I would rather we work through all the issues and answer them together. And that is why I intend to ask the LGA, the ADCS and SOLACE to take part in a new ministerial advisory group on the role of local authorities. In the coming months and, importantly, with input from elected members and officers, it will consider what further action should be taken to ensure that local government has the powers and support it needs to fulfil its strong, strategic role. And I hope you will take the chance to shape our thinking. Conclusion I won’t deny that we have an ambitious agenda, nor that we are trying to achieve it in the most difficult and testing of circumstances. But as you know, there’s no point being in politics, fighting elections and seeking office unless you’re ambitious to make a difference. And I do believe that we have an opportunity to change our country, irreversibly, for the better. There is no task more urgent for government than securing the future of our country, whether that’s by restarting the economy or getting education right. And there is no doubt that the best way for us to do achieve both if through all parts of government, central and local working together, working together, in partnership."
/government/publications/ofsted-early-years-annual-report-201213,"This early years report represents a departure for Ofsted – the first time it has published its annual review of the sector separately from the other sectors it inspects. This represents an opportunity to shine a light on pressing issues facing this particular sector and to make a contribution to raising the prestige and profile of the important work done by practitioners in early years."
/government/news/early-education-is-better-than-ever-but-attainment-gap-remains,"Early education is better than ever but the attainment gap remains wide. Early education has never been stronger with 85 per cent of early years settings now judged good or outstanding, the Ofsted Early Years Annual Report 2015 reveals today. The report finds that rising standards are evenly spread across all types of early years settings. As of 31 March 2015: 84 per cent of childminders were good or outstanding 87 per cent of private, voluntary and independent nurseries were good or outstanding Overall, 72 per cent of all early years settings were good while 13 per cent were outstanding. In addition, the quality of early years provision in 86 per cent of primary schools inspected during the last two terms was good or outstanding. Early education is helping to prepare young children to be ready when they begin school. Between 2013 and last year, there was a marked increase in children reaching a good level of development at the end of their Reception year, from 52 per cent to 60 per cent. Today’s report finds that although poorer children’s development is continuing to rise in line with their classmates, the attainment gap between disadvantaged children and their peers has not narrowed. The report points out that nearly half (42 per cent) of all two-year-olds (around 113,000) eligible for 15 hours of free early education have not taken up their place in any type of setting. It also finds that fewer than 5,000 schools are taking two-year-olds and those that do are taking a disproportionate number of children from better-off families. Only nine per cent of two-year-olds in schools are on a funded place. There are 40 local authorities where there are no disadvantaged two-year-olds in any maintained school. In a speech to launch the report, HM Chief Inspector Sir Michael Wilshaw said that more needs to be done to encourage parents of the poorest two-year-old children to take up the offer of a funded place in a high-quality provider. He called on children’s centres and health visitors to promote take-up. Sir Michael said there was a strong case for schools to take many more of the poorest children from the age of two. Schools have the in-built advantage of being able to offer continuity across the transition to Reception, have more access to specialist support, employ well qualified graduate teachers and are familiar with tracking children’s development. HM Chief Inspector Sir Michael Wilshaw said: There can be no doubt that the quality of early years provision is better now than at any point in Ofsted’s history. But we know it is the poorest children who have the most to gain if they are being well taught before they reach statutory school age – and the most to lose if they are not. So we need to incentivise schools to take more disadvantaged two-year-olds and to work with other early years providers in their local area. We also need to do much more to encourage the most disadvantaged parents to take up the funded places scheme for two-year-olds, which is currently not reaching anywhere near enough children. Certainly local authorities can play a role here. Because of their responsibilities for children’s centres, they can do more to make sure children’s centres have the essential information they need to do this work. But what is really needed is someone who meets the parents of every child who is eligible for funded early education from two. Someone who will speak to them, and make sure they know what their child needs, and what they are entitled to. Someone who will be accountable for making sure that no one slips through the net. Fortunately, there is someone who can do this. That person is the health visitor. Health visitors already have a particular responsibility to help the poorest families and from September they will be moving under local authority control. This is the ideal opportunity to make sure every parent whose child is eligible for a funded place knows about this and is being encouraged to start their child in early education, in a school wherever possible.” Ofsted has today also published a good practice survey of perceptions of teaching through play. Ofsted has worked with the early years sector and found that professionals are increasingly willing to embrace the idea of teaching the very youngest children and are more willing to see themselves as teachers. Nick Hudson, Ofsted Early Education Director, said: I am really pleased that more early years settings are providing good or better early education. They are providing a safe environment in which young children can have fun but also learn and develop. Parents know that children learn through play. The two are not exclusive. From our survey, Ofsted inspectors saw the most progress in those nurseries, childminders and other early years settings which had developed children’s skills across a rich range of experiences. It is however troubling that the attainment gap remains stubbornly wide between the poorest young children and their classmates. If more poorer children receive high quality early education well before they start school, then it is likely that more will have reached a good level of development by the end of their first year in primary school.

/government/speeches/michael-gove-to-the-durand-academy,"It’s a huge pleasure to be here in Durand, one year on from its conversion to an academy. An already outstanding school doing a wonderful job for children in one of London’s most challenging neighbourhoods has, in the last twelve months, made even more amazing strides forward. New support for children in the early years. More superb academic results at the end of Key Stage Two. A new cohort of brilliant young teachers trained here – in the classroom – and transforming children’s lives. And exciting plans drawn up to establish a brand new secondary school – with boarding accommodation - ensuring that young people in Lambeth can enjoy an outstanding state education which will equip them for the future every bit as effectively as any private school. What has been achieved here is inspiring – and underlines how, thanks to great teaching, our young people can achieve anything. Durand´s success is a result of partnerships. The school benefits from the active support given by caring parents. They know what a good education looks like, are ambitious for their children and believe in the aspirational ethos which permeates every classroom and corridor. Children enjoy brilliant teaching from gifted young professionals. We are uniquely fortunate to have the best generation of teachers ever working in England’s schools today. And the whole school community has a passionate and committed champion in the local MP, Kate Hoey. Kate has been a brave campaigner for educational excellence and a principled advocate for a better deal for disadvantaged young people throughout her career. She has always known instinctively what I have always believed passionately – the overwhelming majority of parents, whatever their background, want the same thing for their children. High academic standards. Rigorous qualifications respected by quality colleges and employers. Strict discipline, smart uniforms and respect for your elders. Playgrounds free of bullying and classrooms free of disruption. Teachers who instil the values of care, consideration and respect for others. And the assurance every child is being stretched so their individual talent can be nurtured. That is what Durand provides – what so many great state schools provide – and with these ingredients in place children from any background can prosper. Because the ingredients which make Durand a success have been applied elsewhere across South London. Look at the academy schools set up by one of the most admirable men I know – Phil Harris – Lord Harris of Peckham. His academy in Peckham gets half its students to secure five good passes at GCSE including English and Maths. When the school was run by the local authority only five per cent of children got those passes. Every single one of the schools he takes over gets at least an additional twenty per cent or more young people to pass five good GCSEs compared to the record when the local authority ran it. Some get 40 per cent more. His schools in Merton and South Norwood get 50 per cent more. And some of these schools have only been in his control for a couple of years. Phil is able to support state education so generously because of his success in business. His firm Carpetright has brought jobs and opportunities, as well as high quality low cost flooring solutions, to thousands. But many of you may also remember that Phil – and those who work for him – were, like many of us, victims of August’s outbreak of social disorder. His flagship building in Tottenham was torched in an act of nihilistic destruction. And it became, for a period, a symbol of London’s loss this summer. I found that tragic. Because the buildings which tell the real story of what London’s young people are like, and are capable of, are the academies Phil runs which turn out hundreds of brilliant, talented, wholly admirable young men and women every summer. And we have to make sure that the future for our young people is shaped by the values which make the Harris Academies such a success, not the values which ran riot on our streets this summer. We cannot say often enough that what we saw this summer was a straightforward conflict between right and wrong. On the one hand the overwhelming majority – those who work hard, those who set up their own businesses, those who came to this country to build a better life and create prosperity for others. And on the other hand – a vicious, lawless, immoral minority who need to know that their crimes will result in exemplary punishment. But while the first step in putting right what went wrong is clarity about responsibility. The next set of steps require honesty about what has happened in our society. To investigate where the looters came from is not to make excuses because of background. It is to shine a light on failures that originated in poor policy, skewed priorities and the deliberate undermining of legitimate authority. I believe in reform of our education system because I want to give inspirational teachers more freedom to do the job they love and give every child, whatever their background, an opportunity to get on. But we know, every teacher knows, there are some children for whom education currently is a tragic succession of missed opportunities. There is a direct line to deprivation which begins when children are failed in primary because their behaviour is not policed with proper boundaries and they are not taught how to read properly. When these young people arrive in secondary school they cannot follow the curriculum and cover up their failure with a show of bravado, acting up in class. That disruption is, in many cases, not effectively checked. That’s not because of any failing on the part of the teaching profession. It’s because we politicians haven’t given them the tools and training to keep order. The learning of every child suffers but the disruptive children lose out most. Some drift out of formal learning – playing truant and then becoming persistently absent. They, and others who cause disruption, are often excluded from effective education and placed in ‘Alternative Provision’ and ‘Pupil Referral Units’. Some of these units do a great job in tough circumstances. But in many of these units for excluded children there is often no effective academic learning which prepares young people for work, no guarantee of effective supervision for the necessary number of hours, no accountability for money spent or outcomes achieved and no secure barrier to prevent these young people drifting further into gang culture or criminality. These young people are not in school for much of their teenage years – they are on the streets – and on my conscience. For all the advances we have made, and are making in education, we still, every year allow thousands more children to join an educational underclass – they are the lost souls our school system has failed. It is from that underclass that gangs draw their recruits, young offenders institutions find their inmates and prisons replenish their cells. These are young people who, whatever the material circumstances which surround them, grow up in the direst poverty - with a poverty of ambition, a poverty of discipline, a poverty of soul. I recognise that using a word like underclass has potentially controversial connotations. It can seem to divide society into them and us. But I believe there’s a merit in plain speaking. I am also haunted by the thought that I might, if circumstances had been different, been one of them. I was born to a single parent, never knew my biological father and spent my first few months in care. Thanks to the love of my adoptive mother and father, and the education I enjoyed, I was given amazing opportunities. So I know just how much the right parenting, the right values at home, and the right sort of school matter in determining a child’s fate. I also know that if we are to tackle the scandal of our educational underclass we cannot shrink from radical action. We need to make sure children arrive in school ready to learn. We need to make sure children in primary school learn to read. We need to make sure teachers have the tools and the training they need to keep order in class so every child can learn, and that requires a new, explicitly tougher, approach to discipline. We need to make sure children are in education throughout their teenage years, and that requires a new approach to truancy. We need to make sure those children whose behaviour is persistently disruptive are in institutions which are equipped to turn their lives around, institutions which are held accountable for their actions. We need to make sure that every young person is taught in a way which inspires them and prepares them for the world of work. We need to turn round the weakest schools, which are concentrated in our poorest areas, by ensuring nothing stands in the way of giving those children a quality education. And we need, restlessly and relentlessly, to challenge, everywhere and always, the culture of low expectations that condemns so many young people to a lifetime incarcerated in a prison house of ignorance. Let me spell out the action we are taking in each of these areas – and the further action I propose to take in the months ahead to accelerate our reform programme. Firstly, school readiness. If there is one theme which predominates in the conversations I have had with primary school teachers in the last year or so it is the difficulty they have in dealing with children who arrive in reception class totally unprepared to learn. Teachers report to me that a growing number of children cannot form letters or even hold a pencil. Many cannot sit and listen. Many can scarcely communicate orally, let alone frame a question. Many cannot use a knife and fork. Many cannot even go to the lavatory properly. Some express their frustration through displays of inarticulate rage. More than 1,200 children aged seven or under have been permanently excluded from their primary schools for violence or other disruptive activity in the last five years. A further 53,000 children aged seven or under were suspended for similar behaviour. If children arrive in school unable to sit, listen and learn and then disrupt the learning of others then lives begin already blighted. Which is why we are intervening. It’s why we are increasing the number of health visitors to give parents good advice at the start of their child’s life and spot danger signs. It’s why we are overhauling the adoption process to get children out of the most dysfunctional homes where their futures are at risk and into the arms of loving adoptive parents. It’s why we are paying to extend fifteen hours of pre-school education every week to the most disadvantaged two-year-olds. It’s why we have extended the number of hours of pre-school education available to three and four year olds from twelve and a half hours to fifteen hours. But we can never do enough to improve a child’s development in the early years. Which is why the Government is going to follow up the work of Graham Allen and Frank Field to extend the scope of early intervention. The Social Policy Review which the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister are leading will take things further. But let me be clear. The number of families where we need to intervene is small. I do not support an extension of the state’s reach into the lives of every parent. That will only undermine the virtues – of self-discipline, responsibility and aspiration – which we need to encourage. But where we do need to intervene we should not be worried about accusations that we are being judgemental, authoritarian or old-fashioned. Children should not be brought up in conditions of squalor, should not have to endure abuse, should not have to witness domestic violence, should not be left to vegetate in front of the television while alcoholic or drug-addicted parents ignore their needs. Having read – in the serious case reviews which follow child deaths or serious abuse – of some of the terrible conditions in which children are raised in modern Britain it is clear we need to be tougher on inadequate parents. We have a responsibility to protect. By making it easier to take vulnerable children into care, making it easier to ensure those children are adopted quickly and making it easier for those who adopt to secure the future of those whom they have enfolded in love. If we do not act we will perpetuate the suffering of innocents by allowing them to be inducted into a lifestyle without boundaries, self-respect or hope. And in the same way as I support intervention to ensure children arrive in school ready to learn so I support intervention to ensure children in school learn the most important thing of all – how to read. You cannot read to learn until you have learnt to read. But the level of illiteracy in England is shocking. At the end of primary school one child in six still cannot read properly. And illiteracy is concentrated in some of our poorest communities. A full 42 per cent of black Caribbean boys, and 60 per cent of white boys eligible for free school meals aren’t reading properly at the age of 14. But there is nothing either inevitable or fixed about the number of people who cannot read properly. We know that teaching using the right methods can effectively eliminate illiteracy. Using systematic synthetic phonics – a traditional method of sounding out and blending letters – can help almost any child save the most severely disabled to read English – whatever their socio-economic, cultural or ethnic background. Rigorous academic research in Scotland – in Clackmannanshire and West Dunbartonshire – has confirmed that the early and effective deployment of systematic synthetic phonics effectively eliminates illiteracy. Which is why we are providing schools with the resources and teachers with the training to deliver effective phonics teaching in every classroom. And we will hold every school to account for how successfully they teach reading. Every child will have a new reading check after two years at primary school to ensure they are decoding fluently. Once secure in this basic skill then children can read for pleasure, and enrichment, to pursue their own interests and to discover the best that has been thought and written. But unless children are secure in that basic skill then reading remains a painful, difficult and obscure process. Especially for those children who grow up in homes without books, without a reading culture, without access to literary excellence. There is a considerable lobby which argues that any additional check on children’s progress, of the kind we are introducing for reading, is unfair, generates more work for everyone and narrows the purpose of education. Which is, of course, nonsense. What is unfair is a world in which the children of professors grow up surrounded by books and ready to read at six while many children who are poor grow up in ignorance and ready to rebel long before they’re sixteen. What generates more work for everyone is a culture which acquiesces in failure early on and then leaves us all to pick up the pieces when a confused and betrayed child finds he has been denied access to his birthright. And what really narrows the purpose of education is a failure to give children the key to understanding the full richness of human achievement, instead leaving them frustrated, disruptive and branded too difficult to teach. Because one thing of which we can be certain is that the children who have not learnt to read properly are the children who disrupt everyone else’s learning and fatally endanger their own futures. There is an ironclad link between illiteracy, disruption, truancy, exclusion and crime which we need to break. But we must accept that there is no single measure any Government can take which will ensure proper behaviour in all our schools. Over the years there has been a slow, and sustained, erosion of legitimate adult authority in this country. It has been subverted by a culture of dutiless rights which empowers the violent young to ignore civilised boundaries which exist to protect the weak and vulnerable. I am a strong supporter of defending children’s rights The right to learn in safety. The right to have their talents nurtured in an ordered environment. The right to express themselves, and their differences, in a culture of respect. But these rights are everyday undermined by our failure to deal with the ignorance, insolence and violence of a minority. The only way to reverse this dissolution of legitimate authority is step-by-step to move the ratchet back in favour of teachers. We need to ensure, in everything we do, that we send a single, consistent, message that teachers are there to be respected, listened to, obeyed. There is nothing arbitrary or unfair in insisting that students respect, and obey, teachers. Teachers possess the knowledge that pupils should aspire to acquire, they have committed themselves to serve others, which is the virtue our society should most prize, and unless their authority is absolute in the classroom then they cannot teach and children cannot learn. So that is why the legislation we are currently taking through Parliament takes every opportunity to strengthen the hand of teachers. For years, teachers have lacked effective powers to search students for items which can cause disruption in class. Like mobile phones, flip video cameras and Blackberries. Students have used their phones in the past to record disruption in school and post details online. This summer we saw how mobile technology can be used to co-ordinate widespread disruption and violence. But there are some in the Lords who think this power to prevent disruption undermines children’s rights. I think nothing could be further from the truth. Stopping the smuggling of Blackberries into classrooms safeguards children’s rights - the crucial rights of the majority to learn in peace, free of the fear of violence and intimidation. According to a survey by the OECD 30 per cent of effective teaching time is lost because of poor behaviour in schools. The right every child deserves to be taught properly is currently undermined by the twisting of rights by a minority who need to be taught an unambiguous lesson in who’s boss. As well as strengthening teachers search powers we are also giving teachers the right to impose detention on the same day a school rule is broken. Incredibly, to me at least, teachers used to have to give at least 24 hours notice of every detention. Of course same day detention is inconvenient for some parents. But then disruption in class is more than inconvenient for every child who suffers. And parents should take responsibility for their child’s behaviour in school. If you don’t want your child to face an inconvenient after-school detention then make sure they don’t misbehave in the first place. As well as reinforcing the authority of teachers with these new powers we have also radically slimmed down the central guidance on discipline – from more than 600 pages of bumf to just 50 pages of clear and helpful support. The mere existence of 600 pages of dos and don’ts on discipline sent a fatal signal to teachers – if you don’t play it by the book you could find it’s you who’s on the receiving end of disciplinary proceedings. So instead of enforcing the rules teachers were cowed by the rules. We are determined to end that. So as well as signalling to teachers they are freer to use their own judgement we are taking every step to back up the exercise of their own authority. We are overhauling teacher training so every new teacher is given the proper support they need to manage poor behaviour. The fear of misbehaviour is a barrier to many good people becoming teachers and a reason why many good people leave the profession. But not nearly enough time and expertise is devoted to giving new teachers the training they need to keep order. Our new teaching schools - 100 outstanding schools with a superb record in raising achievement and exhibiting great teaching – will play a central role in giving teachers the practical hands-on experience they need in classroom management. We will shift the emphasis in teacher training from outdated theory to the very best practice, and to outstanding providers – schools like Durand. And we will ensure that when new teachers arrive in class they can deploy not just the skills they have acquired but also plain common sense. That is why we have overhauled the rules on physical contact to make clear that schools should not have a no-touch policy and it is right to intervene physically to maintain order. Or indeed to comfort a child in distress. And it is also why I cannot proceed with rules the last Government put in place which would have required teachers to go through an arduous bureaucratic process to record the details of every instance they do have to physically restrain children. The last thing teachers need at this time is another piece of regulation inhibiting their judgment, undermining common sense. The National Association of Head Teachers and the Association of School and College Leaders have both warned that this new regulation increases the burden on teachers. And I have listened to what they, and other professionals, have said. So let me be crystal clear – if any parent now hears a school say, “sorry, we can’t physically touch the students” then that school is wrong. Plain wrong. The rules of the game have changed. I know, of course, it’s difficult to restore order in some schools. Which is why we’re doing everything we can to support teachers who do the right thing. We’re changing the rules covering the malicious allegations made about brave teachers when they do step in to restore discipline. We know that some of the most disruptive children attempt to divert attention from their own misbehaviour by confecting allegations against teachers who attempt to maintain order. Some of these allegations are foul and the majority baseless. There were 1,700 allegations made against school staff in 2009/10 and fewer than one per cent resulted in dismissal or resignation. But these allegations often lead to the suspension of the teacher concerned, the blackening of his name, a blight on his career progression and, for conscientious public servants, a deep sense of trauma and hurt. That is why we are legislating to give teachers the protection of anonymity when allegations are made. It’s why we have made clear to heads that they should not suspend teachers just because a child has made a wild allegation. Leadership teams should back their staff all the way. We are also making clear to heads that false allegations are themselves a disciplinary offence and could lead to criminal sanctions. And I will also work with the Association of Chief Police Officers and the prosecuting authorities so that these cases are investigated properly without delay ensuring the cloud of suspicion which hangs over professionals can be dispelled as quickly as possible. Critically, these two particular changes, eliminating no touch rules and reforming the process which governs allegations against teachers, will help us in one other crucial change we need to make to improve discipline. We need more male teachers – especially in primary schools – to provide children who often lack male role models at home – with male authority figures who can display both strength and sensitivity. One of the principle concerns that men considering teaching feel is the worry that they will fall foul of rules which make normal contact between adults and children a legal minefield. By changing the rules to make it clear that adults can exercise their own authority and judgement in every aspect of classroom management we can help reverse the flight of men from primary education and bolster still further the strength of the workforce. And specifically in order to ensure that there are many more male role models entering teaching we will be launching our troops to teachers programme later this autumn, so that we can draft gifted individuals from the armed services into the classroom. Professionals who have devoted their lives to training young men and women in uniform will have the chance to intervene earlier in the lives of those they are best equipped to help. The right sort of military training can have a fantastically beneficial impact on young people with a history of poor behaviour. Cadet forces provide structure, discipline and excitement for young people. As independent schools know. Which is why I’ll be asking for their help in extending the number of state schools which have cadet forces. But its not just formal cadet training. The charity Skillforce, which is run by former soldiers, has a fantastic record in working with children who’ve had behaviour problems. It offers programmes which give young people the chance to learn self-discipline, teamwork, endurance, practical problem-solving techniques and useful vocational skills. Its results are amazing. But if young people are to benefit from the sort of programmes Skillforce offers, if they are to encounter strong role models, if they are to benefit from a disciplined learning environment, if they are to secure the qualifications which will give them control over their own lives then they need to be in school. And in far too many cases they are not. In many cases those young people who constitute our educational underclass simply don’t spend enough time in education. The true scale of truancy in this country has been masked by statistical manipulation. And the link between truancy and educational failure is stark. For years, the critical measure of truancy was persistent absence. For a child to count as persistently absent they had to miss at least 20 per cent of sessions. We have just published data that shows a far more revealing picture. There are currently 175,718 children who are absent for this length of time. But if you look at the number of children who are absent for 15 per cent of school time – at least a whole month of education - then the total is 433,129. And the number of children who are absent for 10 per cent of the school year – around 30 sessions – is over a million. A missing million of young people – missing out on school, missing out on learning, missing out on the opportunity to succeed There is a dreadful correlation between poor attendance and educational failure. Overall just over half of young people get five good GCSEs. But only a third of those students who miss between 10 and 20 per cent of school get the basic minimum of five decent GCSE passes. While three quarters of those students who attend 95 per cent of lessons get those five crucial GCSEs. Those heads who have succeeded in turning round poor schools know that you have to tackle attendance first – you have got to have young people in class, on task, all day. Because if they’re not in school when they’re 14, 15 and 16 they won’t be in education, employment or training when they’re 16, 17 and 18. They’ll be on benefits, in gangs and on their way to young offenders institutions. A child who is persistently absent is currently 23 times more likely to end up excluded than other children – and as we know – 80 per cent of young men in custody were previously excluded from school. So we have got to tackle the truancy tragedy in England. We’ve begun by raising the bar. Persistent absence used to be interpreted pretty loosely. You had to miss at least 20 per cent of all school sessions before being considered persistently absent. We’ve tightened the rules so its 15 per cent. And, in due course, I want to go further. We will give teachers the power to ensure attendance improves. They can, at the moment, issue penalty notices and go to the courts to ensure mothers and fathers do their duty to get young people to attend school. But policing of these sanctions is weak. When fines are imposed they are often reduced to take account of an adult’s expenditure on satellite tv, alcohol and cigarettes. And many appear to shrug off fines and avoid existing sanctions, refusing to take responsibility for their actions. So we need to review the sanctions schools, police, the courts, and the Government, have available. I will be asking a team of teaching professionals, under the leadership of our discipline adviser and outstanding headteacher Charlie Taylor, to review these and other policies we might implement to prevent more young people falling into the educational underclass. In return for giving schools more power, we will also expect them to secure improved attendance. Schools where truancy persists can expect much closer scrutiny. In preparation for the new tougher inspection system, Ofsted will be trialling no notice monitoring inspections this term, targeting schools with poor disciplinary records and poor attendance. These surprise inspections will mean that schools cannot – as some do – use a notice period to hide disciplinary issues. And the insistence on effective attendance will mean schools cannot – as some have – hide their poor disciplinary record by acquiescing in the absence of the most disruptive children. We cannot have a situation where those most in need are abandoned – denied their right to education because we’ve denied teachers the authority they need to teach. Of course, it’s not just by acquiescing in truancy that weak schools condemn some of their students to membership of the educational underclass. It’s also by formally excluding or referring these children into institutions which are, in too many cases, poorly equipped to turn young peoples’ lives round. At any time there are between 40 and 70 thousand children in alternative provision – in local authority pupil referral units or other institutions which are there to cater for those with behavioural problems. Some of these PRUs are outstanding. Like the Bridge Academy run by Hammersmith and Fulham Council which does a superb job. The teachers and other gifted professionals who work in our best PRUs and offer the strongest alternative provision do the hardest job in education. And they deserve additional support in their work. Which we will give. But, despite the best efforts of many dedicated professionals, far too few PRUs meet the standards we need. Last year only 2 per cent were judged outstanding for educational achievement. While 32 per cent of them were judged inadequate for attendance. And it’s not as though attendance at PRUs is onerous. The rules politicians have put in place mean they do not even have to provide a statutory minimum number of teaching hours. Of course the poor quality of some alternative provision should not mean we limit the freedom of professionals in mainstream schools to take the steps they need to maintain order. Exclusion is an important tool all schools need to be able to use. It is critical to any effective discipline policy that schools have the freedom to exclude children who have clearly over-stepped the mark. And it is important that when children are excluded for violent acts and grotesque intimidation that they cannot be re-instated over the heads of a school’s leader and its governing body. If we are to send a consistent message that adult authority is to be respected then we cannot send a violent child back to a school from which a long-suffering head has expelled him. That is why we are legislating to reform the exclusion process to reinforce the authority of a school’s head and its governors. But if we are to help schools deal effectively with disruptive children we need the policies which will secure much better alternative provision. And that’s why we’re acting now to help professionals do an even better job. We’re making sure PRUs are better governed and held to account for student performance. We’re allowing those PRUs which are outstanding to acquire Academy freedoms and grow so more young people can benefit from their leadership. And we’re allowing new providers to help by allowing alternative provision Free Schools to be established specifically aimed at supporting the most challenging children. We’re also planning to overhaul the whole exclusion process so schools are given the money local authorities currently spend on alternative provision, they are given the freedom to commission the right alternative provision and they are then held to account for the performance of those children they place in alternative provision. By giving schools more resources, more flexibility and also more responsibility, the whole system will be better aligned to give all children the support they need. But I want to be certain that we are doing everything – everything – to improve the quality of alternative provision. Can it be right that there is no minimum guarantee of the number of hours of education young people are given? Can it be right that so many young people in PRUs are allowed to be absent for so long without sanctions? Can it be right that we have children with serious, clinically-specific, special educational needs being housed alongside those whose problems are behavioural not physical or neurological? Can it be right that so much alternative provision is not properly registered, and therefore not properly inspected and not properly held to account? That is why I will be asking the team led by Charlie Taylor to look urgently into how we can improve alternative provision – and make sure another generation are not failed. I will be asking them specifically to work with Lord Harris of Peckham to see if we can accelerate the ability of Academy chains to establish new provision for excluded and disruptive pupils But critical as that work will be, a proper national effort to stop any more children joining this educational underclass requires us to be determined in tackling failure everywhere. There are more than one thousand primary schools where more than forty per cent of children leave unable to read write and add up properly. More than 200 of those primaries have been under-performing for at least five years. Many of them are concentrated in local authorities with an entrenched record of poor educational performance who’ve run out of excuses for their failure. More than 200 secondary schools fail to get five good GCSEs for more than a third of their students. Only 16 per cent of students overall get GCSEs in the core subjects of English, maths, the sciences, a language and either history or geography. And those schools which do not reach acceptable standards in these areas are, overwhelmingly, the schools with poor attendance records, poor discipline, poor levels of teaching and learning, poor provision of extra-curricular activity, poor links with business or universities and, above all, poor leadership. Which is why we are acting now to give the children currently in those schools a better chance. It’s why we’re setting up university technical colleges – with longer hours, longer terms, a stretching technical curriculum and all the discipline of the workplace. It’s why we’re setting up new studio schools – built on a human scale – for those children failed so far by conventional schools - with a curriculum tailored to those who need practical learning – and teaching delivered by skilled craftsman. It’s why we’ve established 24 free schools – overwhelmingly in areas of educational need – with the longer school days, demanding curricula and brilliant leadership our toughest areas need. It’s also why this year the Academy programme will take its biggest step forward yet – with more under-performing schools than ever before being taken over by high-performing schools, more high-performing schools taking formal responsibility for the weakest and Academy status becoming the norm for the secondary sector. But the scale of the challenge we face means we must go further, and faster. And that is why the Government’s social policy review is so important. Alongside it, I will be raising the floor standard below which no school should fall so we squeeze failure out of the system. I will also be asking more great schools to play an even bigger role in turning round the weakest. I will ensure planning laws change so great new schools can be set up in the poorest areas – and every Government department will be asked to hand over surplus buildings so we can get new schools across the country. And as we review policy in the Department of Education we will look at how we need to further reform funding, take on partisan vested interests and change rules on things like public procurement to build on the idealism which reform has already unleashed Just last week we saw how chains of Academies, not just those in the Harris group, but also those run by Ark, by EACT, by Ormiston and ULT had dramatically improved the performance of pupils since leaving local authority control. Schools in the most challenging areas, with the toughest intakes, turned into beacons of excellence – with young people who’d been written off a generation ago now getting ready to write their first essays at Oxford and Cambridge – and children who’d been destined for the educational underclass now experiencing an education which is truly world-class. Looking at those schools – looking at this school – it’s impossible not to be optimistic about the future – but we will only achieve everything of which we’re capable if we remember that nothing – nothing – should be allowed to stand in the way of the reforms which will give every child the education we would wish for our own."
/government/news/100-million-to-support-the-education-of-children-in-care,"The new ‘pupil premium plus’ will see funding to support children in care at school increase by £1,000 per pupil. Children will be covered as soon as they enter care and 10,000 more children in care will benefit, bringing the total to 50,000. Children in care have previously attracted pupil premium funding at the same rate as children from low-income families, but in future they will attract a higher rate of funding - the pupil premium plus. From April next year, children in care will attract £1,900 additional funding per pupil, more than double the £900 awarded in 2013 to 2014. In addition, this support will now reach more children. At the moment, children in care attract the pupil premium if they have been looked after for 6 months or more, but in future they will be funded from their first day in care. Total funding will increase from £40 million in 2013 to 2014 to £100 million in 2014 to 2015. Edward Timpson said: Children in care face unique challenges at school and often struggle to keep up with their peers at both primary and secondary level. It’s vital that these vulnerable children are given the targeted support they need and the education they deserve to help them get on in life. I’m delighted to announce that we’re more than doubling funding to support the education of children in care whilst at school and that from next year they will receive this extra support from the moment they enter care. Children in care do not perform as well at school as their peers, often not helped by their precare experiences. In 2012: only 50% of children in care achieved the expected level in both English and maths at key stage 2, compared with 79% of non-looked-after children just 15% of children in care achieved 5 A* to C GCSEs or equivalent, including English and maths, compared with 58% of non-looked-after children Through the Children and Families Bill, the government is also making it mandatory for every council to have a ‘virtual school head’ - an individual who champions the education of children in care and acts as their overarching head. Today’s announcement includes plans to extend the role of the virtual school head to work with schools to manage the pupil premium plus and ensure that the money is spent on securing the best educational support and services for children in care. For example, this could include specialist tuition for musically gifted children or one-to-one catch-up sessions. For the first time, children adopted from care and those who leave care under a special guardianship order or residence order will also attract the pupil premium plus. The pupil premium is just one of a series of measures the government has introduced to help children in care achieve at school and get on in life: the National College for Teaching and Leadership is improving its training programme for school governors to improve the attainment of looked-after children and to work more closely with virtual school heads we are providing all looked-after young people and care leavers aged 16 to 19 who stay in full-time education with a £1,200 bursary to help with the costs of their studies all 2-year-olds in care are now eligible for 15 hours a week early education Notes to editor In 2011, the government introduced the pupil premium. This gives schools extra funding to raise attainment for disadvantaged pupils and close the attainment gaps between the most disadvantaged pupils and their peers. Children from low-income families and children who have been looked after for 6 months or more attract the pupil premium, worth £900 per pupil in 2013 to 2014. Today ministers are announcing that children in care will, in future, attract a higher rate of pupil premium funding - the ‘pupil premium plus’. In 2014 to 2015, this will be worth £1,900 per child per year. Ministers are also announcing today that, from April 2014, children in care will be funded from the first day of care. For the first time, children adopted from care and those who leave care under a special guardianship order or residence order will also attract the pupil premium plus. The latest statistics on education outcomes for looked-after children were published in December 2012. The government is making it a legal requirement for all councils to have a virtual school head through the Children and Families Bill. Local authorities that already have strong virtual school head arrangements in place achieve above the national average for looked-after children. For example, in 2012, 40% of looked-after children in Warrington achieved 5 good GCSEs including English and maths, alongside 37.5% in North Tyneside and 22.2% in Dudley. Over the coming months, we will work with virtual school heads and schools to determine how the virtual school head can help schools use the pupil premium to best effect. [Contact:997]"
/government/publications/childrens-experiences-of-the-early-years-foundation-stage,"Researchers worked with 146 children aged between 3 and 5 in different types of early years settings across four local authorities in England. The sample comprised sixteen settings, including one Steiner setting. The methodology was designed to explore children’s perceptions of their experiences and to relate these perceptions to the early years foundation stage ( EYFS ). Researchers spent time with children, talking to them and sharing in activities. They then focused on the things that seemed to be most important to the children, for example the kinds of play they were keen to show and/or talk about. In this research, particular consideration was given to play-based learning, outdoor provision and children’s participation, linked to the 6 areas of learning in the EYFS . The findings contributed to an independent review of the EYFS , led by Dame Clare Tickell from September 2010."
/government/news/funding-for-phonics-teaching-to-improve-childrens-reading,"Schools Minister Nick Gibb today announced a matched funding scheme to help primary schools teach systematic synthetic phonics and drive up reading standards. Primary schools will be able to claim up to £3,000, if they match that funding, to spend on materials which meet the Department for Education’s criteria for an effective phonics programme. A list of approved resources - including phonics products for teachers and pupils and training for teachers - will be published by the Department by September although some products and training will be available by the end of June. Schools will decide which of the resources will help them to deliver high-quality phonics teaching for their pupils and will be able to buy products and training with the match-funding any time up to March 2013. The Government is introducing a new phonics-based screening check for six-year-olds so teachers can identify children not at the expected reading level and in need of extra support. In last year’s primary school tests 15 per cent of pupils did not reach the standard expected at Key Stage 1 and 16 per cent were below the standard expected at Key Stage 2. England has slipped down the international table for reading in primary schools. The Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS) of 10-year-olds saw England fall from third out of 35 countries in 2001 to 15th out of 40 countries in 2006. Schools Minister Nick Gibb said: This match-funding will mean all schools with six-year-old pupils will be able to buy approved products and training to help them teach high-quality systematic synthetic phonics. There is more to reading than phonics. But high-quality academic evidence from across the world - from Scotland and Australia to the National Reading Panel in the US - shows that the systematic teaching of synthetic phonics is the best way to teach literacy to all children, and especially those aged five to seven. Learning to read is a fundamental part of a child’s education and vital to their prospects in secondary school, further and higher education, and work. The new phonics check will ensure that children who need extra help are given the support they need to enable them to enjoy a lifetime’s love of reading. The check will be piloted in a representative sample of about 300 schools in June. Evidence from the pilot and other policy advice will be considered before the assessment arrangements are finalised. How phonics works Phonics focuses on sounds rather than, for example, having children try to recognise whole words. In analytic phonics, words are broken down into their beginning and end parts, such as ‘str-‘ and ‘eet’, with an emphasis on ‘seeing’ the words and analogy with other words. In synthetic phonics, children start by sequencing the individual sounds in words - for example, ‘s-t-r-ee-t’, with an emphasis on blending them together. Once they have learned all these, they progress to reading books. The ‘synthetic’ part comes from the word ‘synthesise’, meaning to assemble or blend together. Children who learn using synthetic phonics are able to have a go at new words working from sound alone, whereas those using analytic phonics are more dependent on having prior knowledge of families of words. Research evidence In Clackmannanshire, Scotland, a seven-year study of the teaching of synthetic phonics to 300 children found they made more progress in reading and spelling than other children their age. A 2005 Australian report, Teaching Reading, found: The incontrovertible finding from the extensive body of local and international evidence-based literacy research is that for children during the early years of schooling (and subsequently if needed) to be able to link their knowledge of spoken language to their knowledge of written language, they must first master the alphabetic code - the system of grapheme-phoneme correspondences that link written words to their pronunciations. Because these are both foundational and essential skills for the development of competence in reading, writing and spelling, they must be taught explicitly, systematically, early and well. The US National Reading Panel report of 2006 said: Systematic synthetic phonics instruction had a positive and significant effect on disabled readers’ reading skills. These children improved substantially in their ability to read words and showed significant, albeit small, gains in their ability to process text as a result of systematic synthetic phonics instruction. This type of phonics instruction benefits both students with learning disabilities and low-achieving students who are not disabled. Moreover, systematic synthetic phonics instruction was significantly more effective in improving low socio-economic status (SES) children’s alphabetic knowledge and word reading skills than instructional approaches that were less focused on these initial reading skills… Across all grade levels, systematic phonics instruction improved the ability of good readers to spell. Notes to editors All materials that schools can buy have to meet the Department’s criteria which can be found on the Department for Education’s website . The approved list of products and training will be in a catalogue to make it easier for schools to select products and training that best meet their requirements and the learning needs of their pupils. It will provide schools with a range of products and training that they can choose with the confidence that they all meet the criteria considered essential for good phonics teaching. They will be able to buy whole systematic synthetic phonics programmes or resources to supplement their existing programmes, teachers’ resources, materials for pupils, and training for individual teachers or all the staff. They will also be able to buy materials which will help children who need additional support in reading to catch up. The approved list will be published in September. The US National Reading Panel report published in 2006 is available online. The Schools White Paper, ‘The Importance of Teaching’, published in November 2010, made a commitment to ensure there is support available to every school for the teaching of systematic synthetic phonics, as the best method for teaching reading, and to provide funding for high-quality training and classroom teaching resources for all schools with Key Stage 1 pupils.

/government/speeches/making-britain-fit-for-modern-families-speech-by-nick-clegg,"Every weekday morning, across the UK, there’s an army of mums, dads, grandparents and carers cajoling young children to “Hurry up and get ready for their day!” Many of these families are feeling the squeeze. They’re doing what they can to juggle their busy lives. And, now more than ever, one of the biggest things that could help them out is better access to more affordable high-quality childcare. That’s why I’ve made childcare one of my main priorities in government. And whenever money has become available I’ve pushed hard for it to be invested in this area. Last month, the government launched its consultation on our newest offer that will help more of Britain’s working families. This means that from 2015, if your family doesn’t receive support through tax credits or Universal Credit, but both parents are working, or you’re a lone working parent, the government will provide 20% of your childcare costs up to a cost of £6,000, per child, per year. That’s the equivalent of up to £1,200 per child, per year. And from 2016, if you’re a lone parent or couple in work, who pays income tax and relies on Universal Credit to make childcare affordable, or even possible, we’re investing an extra £200 million to increase the contribution we give to your childcare costs from 70% to 85%. This could help out around 200,000 families. Of course, there has been controversy about which families are eligible for these offers. But that doesn’t detract from the fact that this is a substantial package of support that will help ease the pressure for millions of families across the country. And today I want to talk about what we’re doing, step by step, in the coalition government to help every British family balance the demands of their lives with children. (Political content removed) One of the first decisions our government took was to increase the hours of funded early education available for every family with a 3 and 4 year old from 12.5 to 15 hours a week. And today I’m pleased to mark our next step on this path to affordable, accessible childcare; launching the government’s latest free childcare offer for 2 year olds. From today, if you’re a parent on a low income with a 2 year old in the family your child will qualify for 15 hours a week of free early years’ education. Any childcare and early learning provider – that’s nursery, preschool or childminder – rated outstanding or good by Ofsted can provide places. These funded places are focused on helping the families that need them most. That’s around 130,000 2 year olds – 1 in every 5. We are investing over £500 million this year. And have distributed £100 million to local authorities to create new places to ensure those children eligible right now can benefit from these funded places from today. The households, which qualify are those that meet the same eligibility requirements as for free school meals. If that’s you, or you think it might be, your local authority is there to help you. They will confirm if you’re eligible and can help you take up a place for your child. And we’ve also made this support available to 2 year olds, who are looked after by their local authorities. So that they too can benefit from the great start this valuable early learning support provides. And from this time next year, we want to extend that helping hand even further. Our investment will increase to £760 million to help another 130,000 children, whose families are on the next rung of the income ladder. In total, that will mean extra places for around 40% of families with 2 year olds. And today, I am pleased to confirm that this will be working families, who earn under £16,190 a year and rely on working tax credits. The 40% most feeling the squeeze. This support will also be there to help children, who have been adopted, are in care, or have a disability or special educational needs. And I want to thank all of those local authorities and early year’s education providers working hard across England, to ensure that the children who qualify right now can access their place from day one. I’m delighted at the response we’ve had so far from nurseries and child-minders in preparing these extra places and promoting this offer to parents. These people are amongst those you rely on the most when your children are young. And the coalition government has been working with providers to reduce paperwork, improve quality and increase routes into this sector. So that when you drop your child off at nursery, preschool, or their child-minder you know they’ll get the best early learning, care and support possible throughout their day. (Political content removed) I know that some of you will be thinking…why not give this free support to every 2 year old? Why not help every family? And it is certainly my long-term ambition to extend free support to all 2 year olds. But the fact is that at a time of limited resources you’ve got to start somewhere. And for me, it’s better for us to start with those children, who can benefit most from high-quality early year’s education, but who too often miss out. All the evidence shows that if you take 2 young children – hanging up their coats next to each other on the first day of school – the poorer child will already be behind their better-off classmate. And if we don’t step in to help these children, that gap just keeps getting bigger. We’re talking about a child’s journey through life already being mapped out for them before they’ve even set foot in a classroom. Well-off children are more likely to become well-off adults. Poorer children are more likely to stay poor. And not only do these children suffer. The whole class suffers, as teachers have to focus more of their efforts on children frustrated and left behind through no fault of their own. (Political content removed) As a Liberal, I believe that every British family, whatever its structure, background and circumstances, should be able to get on in life. And that the role of government should be to support, not control, our families. To make their choices possible, not to dictate their choices. It’s not for us to tell you whether you should stay at home or not. You have to decide what’s best for your family. And the modern British family comes in all shapes and sizes. But it is government’s responsibility to help those families feeling the squeeze; those who find it hard to meet their childcare costs. That’s why in government, we’re doing everything we can to reform, simplify and modernise those parts of the system that are making it harder for your families to realise their ambitions. (Political content removed) From day one in government, we’ve worked with the belief that if modern families no longer fit the system, then it’s the outdated system that needs to change. That’s why from next year, we’re extending the right to request flexible working to every employee. So that the vital back up team of grandparents, family members and friends who would love to do more to help you out now can. And from 2015, if you’re a new parent you’ll also have greater freedom and flexibility to use and share leave during the maternity leave period in a way that works for you. Now, of course, this doesn’t mean that we can put off the tough decisions we need to take to get the massive deficit we inherited under control. But what you can be sure of is that the choices we make will be rooted in evidence and focusing investment where it can help your families most. The crucial question every parent asks when weighing up whether to work, or take on extra hours is: how much of my earnings will I keep after costs like tax, childcare, travel and so on? That’s why we’re designing the system to ensure that families get to keep more of what they earn and that work pays. It’s why we’ve committed to raise the personal allowance on income tax. So that basic rate taxpayers will get to keep all of the first £10,000 they earn. We’ve already taken over 2 million people out of paying income tax altogether. And by the time these changes are complete, they will be worth around £700 a year for 20 million basic rate taxpayers. We believe this is a better way to help your family. To put this money back in your pocket for you to spend on what you know can help your family best, rather than have the government decide that for you. And alongside our additional childcare investment in Universal Credit, I’ve also fought hard to ensure that the system no longer penalises those parents who want to go back to work, but can only work less than 16 hours. Securing £200 million of investment that will benefit an extra 100,000 low-income families. Previously, these parents knew that if they worked less than 16 hours a week, they would lose their existing benefits from day one, but not qualify for any additional support through the tax-credit system. This left them in the ridiculous position of knowing that their families would be worse off despite them working the hours they could. Now they know that the work they do will always pay. (Political content removed) Within government, it will always be one of my biggest priorities to ensure that when both you and your children set out to achieve your ambitions, the choices available to you are greater, the sums add up a little easier and that, at every step of this road, our government is working hard to build a stronger economy and fairer society in Britain. A Britain fit for modern families."
/government/news/special-educational-needs-and-disabilities-green-paper-20-pathfinders-to-test-proposals,"The government has announced today (21 September 2011) that 20 pathfinders, covering 31 local authorities and their primary care trust (PCT) partners, will test out the main proposals in the SEN and disabilities green paper. The consultation on the SEN and disabilities green paper received 2,378 responses - 26 per cent were from parents and parents’ organisations. Children’s Minister, Sarah Teather, said: We’re proposing the biggest reforms in 30 years to help disabled children and those with special educational needs so we need to make sure we get them right. It’s good to see that the overall response from parents, teachers and professionals is supportive of our vision for change. There are some interesting responses that will help us shape future policy decisions. For example, we can see that people think there should be a greater emphasis on meeting particular needs that emerge in school, just as much as identifying development problems in the early years. I’m looking forward to seeing how the pathfinders progress over the next few months to test out how we can make our proposed changes a reality. The pathfinders will all test some core elements of reform, including: a single education, health and care plan from birth to 25 years old, focusing on whether outcomes for disabled children and their parents have been improved personal budgets for parents of disabled children and those with SEN so they can choose which services best suit the needs of their children strong partnership between all local services and agencies working together to help disabled children and those with SEN improved commissioning, particularly through links to health reforms the role of voluntary and community sector organisations and parents in a new system the cost of reform. Pathfinders will also test some optional elements, including: whether a national funding framework would help parents understand what level of funding is available to support their child’s needs better support to help parents through the process support to vulnerable children through the new process and the impact of reforms on children aged 16 to 25, or children in the early years. The pathfinders will receive up to £150,000 per local authority per year. Notes to editors The pathfinder programme has been commissioned by the DfE and the Department for Health.

/government/statistics/eyfsp-attainment-by-pupil-characteristics-2013,"This publication builds upon headline attainment figures presented in the SFR Early years foundation stage profile results: 2012 to 2013 published on 24 October 2013 by focusing on differences in achievement for each of the pupil characteristics. The release shows attainment by gender, ethnicity, eligibility for free school meals ( FSM ), special educational needs ( SEN ), English as a first language and month of birth. The figures contained within this publication combine the information gathered through the school census in January 2013 and the 2013 EYFSP teacher assessments. A new EYFS profile was introduced in September 2012 and the first assessments took place in the summer of 2013. The new profile’s ‘emerging’, ‘expected’ and ‘exceeding’ scales are very different to the previous profile’s 117 point scale and the number of early learning goals has been reduced. This means there is a break in the time series as the results will not be comparable to past years. This release includes national and local authority tables showing: the number and percentage of pupils achieving at least the expected level in all early learning goals by pupil characteristics the number and percentage of pupils achieving a good level of development by pupil characteristics the average point score for pupils by pupil characteristics and a further national table showing: the number and percentage achieving each assessment rating within the 17 early learning goals by pupil characteristics Sally Marshall 0114 2742317 sally.marshall@education.gsi.gov.uk"
/government/news/government-trials-parenting-classes-for-all-parents-of-children-under-5,"The government today announced a trial to offer vouchers for parenting classes to mothers and fathers of children under five. This is part of plans to increase support for parents to help them communicate better with their children, encourage good behaviour, and prevent problems developing later on. The trial is likely to run in three or four areas of the country. The Government hopes to encourage demand for parenting classes and reduce the stigma of asking for information, advice and help with parenting. Around three-quarters of parents say they want more information and support to help their parenting. The vouchers will potentially benefit parents from a wide range of backgrounds, not just those who may have significant problems, like drug or alcohol abuse. Many good and able parents still need information and advice in the early years of their child’s life. Most parents will have accessed antenatal classes during pregnancy, which provide useful guidance and support. The trial will give parents similar access to parenting classes in the first five years of their child’s life, so that support does not stop when their baby is born but is available right through to when their child starts school. Children’s Minister Sarah Teather said: The Government should do all it can, without interfering in family life, to support parents to be the best they possibly can be. The first few years of a child’s life can be the toughest period for parents’ relationships. And these early years are also the most crucial for healthy child development. Parenting classes can be life-changing because they give parents the skills to manage challenging situations, give their children clear and firm boundaries and help them learn the consequences of their actions. This strengthens families and means children are better behaved, more respectful and can achieve more at school. Increasing help, advice and support before a child reaches school age also reduces the likelihood of families needing more expensive support later on. It makes moral, social and economic sense. The Government wants to make asking for parenting support the norm rather than the exception. The Government will work with organisations with an existing track record to test the supply and demand for universal parenting classes, as well as other products and services that support families in the earliest years of a child’s life. Evidence shows that parents are the single most important influence on their child’s development. They can have a lasting and positive impact on their children’s emotional, physical and intellectual development. Notes to editors: The Government committed to helping more families to benefit from parenting advice and support, set out in The Families in the Foundation Years policy statement in July.

The report describes in detail what childcare is used by different types of families, changes in take-up over the years, parents’ reasons for using or not using childcare and for choosing particular providers and the influence of childcare arrangements on mothers’ decisions about whether to go out to work. Key breakdowns are by age of child, types of providers, family socio-economic classifications, region, and levels of deprivation. Some time series allow comparisons to be made from 2004 although comparisons between 2010 and 2011 are more common. Some key findings from the survey: In 2011, 78% of all families with children aged under 15 had used some form of childcare. This equated to 4,181,000 families or 5,954,000 children. 63% had used formal childcare and/or early years provision and 39% used informal childcare. There is no change in uptake of formal or informal childcare from 2010. Significant differences in levels of formal childcare use were found when looking at certain characteristics (and remained significant when analysed alongside a range of other factors): Age: receipt of formal childcare was most common among 3- and 4-year-olds (87%) Family circumstances: children in working families and higher income families were more likely to receive formal childcare than workless families or low-income families. Ethnicity: formal childcare is more likely to be used by children from white British families than those from all Asian ethnic groups. Take-up of formal childcare also differed significantly by other characteristics (ethnicity, region, deprivation, and rurality) when they were analysed in isolation but were not statistically significant when analysed alongside other factors. Around one quarter of parents (26%) thought it was difficult or very difficult to pay for childcare (mainly workless families, lone parents) but just over half thought it was easy or very easy to pay (51%). This shows no change from 2010. Just over half (53%) of non-working mothers said that they would prefer to work if they could arrange reliable, convenient, affordable, and good quality childcare, showing no change from the 2010 survey. Amendments have been made to the Childcare and Early Years Survey of Parents 2011 following the identification of the incorrect calculation of the proportion of families not using childcare in the past year.

/government/speeches/written-ministerial-statement-by-sarah-teather-on-the-early-years-foundation-stage,"I am today publishing the reformed Statutory Framework for the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) which will take effect from 1 September 2012. The new, simpler and clearer EYFS framework is an integral part of the Government’s wider vision for families in the foundation years. It demonstrates our commitment to freeing professionals from bureaucracy to focus on supporting children. Together with a more flexible free early education entitlement and new streamlined inspection arrangements, this is a major step towards a lighter touch regulatory regime. But we need to go further. I will continue to seek opportunities to reduce burdens and remove unnecessary regulation and paperwork which undermine professionals’ ability to protect children and promote their development. Last summer, I asked Professor Cathy Nutbrown to consider how we might strengthen the early years workforce. Her report is due in June, and I will carefully consider her recommendations - along with international evidence on staffing levels and qualifications - as we continue to promote early years provision that is high quality and cost effective to parents. Improving the support children receive in their earliest years is central to greater social mobility. Young children develop quickly, and they develop better with the help of high quality early education and good support at home - the cornerstones for children’s success in school and later life. That is why the Government continues to invest heavily in early education, including the expansion of free childcare for three and four year olds, and the new entitlement for two year olds. The EYFS sets out the standards that early years providers must meet. It has improved quality across the early years sector, but some aspects of the 2008 framework have proved overly bureaucratic and burdensome. The reformed EYFS, which builds on the independent advice of Dame Clare Tickell, will reduce paperwork and bureaucracy for professionals and enable them to focus more strongly on the areas of learning most essential for children’s healthy development. It will also simplify assessment at age five, reducing the early learning goals from 69 to 17, and provide for earlier intervention for children who need extra help. When we published our response to the main EYFS consultation on 20 December 2011, we launched a further one-month consultation on new learning and development requirements (as required by the Childcare Act 2006). The responses to this additional consultation were broadly positive and I have made no significant changes to the framework as a result. I am publishing the report of this consultation alongside the Framework. I am also laying before Parliament the amended regulations to enact the reformed Framework. Together, the Early Years Foundation Stage (Learning and Development Requirements) (Amendment) Order 2012, and the Early Years Foundation Stage (Welfare Requirements) Regulations 2012, give legal effect to the requirements set out in the Framework. I am also laying the Childcare (Early Years Register) (Amendment) Regulations 2012, which amend the Childcare (Early Years Register) Regulations 2008. These amendments secure alignment between the conditions which providers must meet for registration with Ofsted, the requirements of the EYFS, and providers’ general responsibility to ensure that all staff are suitable to work with young children. I am placing copies of the EYFS Framework, the statutory instruments, and the report of the learning and development consultation, in the libraries of both Houses. You can find a copy of the Statutory Framework for the Early Years Foundation Stage 2012 from the publications section. [Contact:997]"
/guidance/early-years-initial-teacher-training-funding-guidance,"Overview The National College for Teaching and Leadership ( NCTL ) allocates and funds early years ITT places each academic year. Early years ITT leads to the award of early years teacher status ( EYTS ). We provide training bursaries and training grants to attract high-quality graduates to become early years teachers. This funding can only be used in delivering training programmes to support trainees in meeting the Teachers’ Standards (Early Years) . The training grant includes the costs of assessment against these standards. Trainees and potential applicants should visit the Get Into Teaching website for information about early years ITT . Employers should visit early years ITT : a guide for employers . Training routes Early years ITT leads to the award of EYTS . We offer funding for 2 of the 4 EYTS training routes. We’ll pay training grants to you for trainees eligible for our funding. A list of early years ITT training providers for 2016 to 2017 is available. Graduate entry (full-time) This is for graduates studying full-time. Training is typically over a 1 year period. A training grant of £7,000 is available to cover course fees. Trainees with high academic achievement may be eligible to receive a bursary . You’ll receive the: grant funding on behalf of trainees to cover course fees bursaries to pass on to your trainees Graduate employment based (part-time) This route is for graduates in paid employment in an early years setting who require training and further experience to demonstrate the Teachers’ Standards (Early Years) . Training is part-time and typically takes place over a 1 year period. Funding of £14,000 is available for this route. This will consist of: £7,000 grant funding - you keep this to cover all training course fees up to £7,000 employer incentive - you pass this on to your trainee’s employer There’s no set list of activities for the employer incentive. It’s intended to contribute towards costs incurred by the employer in supporting and employing the trainee during their training and could include: supply cover salary enhancements employment costs National Insurance and other overheads Funding can’t be used for sickness and maternity/paternity pay arrangements; this is the employer’s responsibility. We recommend that you reimburse employers on a term-by-term basis in arrears unless you’ve agreed alternative arrangements. You must keep clear, accurate and up-to-date records of the payments that have been made to employers. Undergraduate entry (full-time) This route is for those who wish to undertake a level 6 degree in an early childhood related subject along with EYTS . It is typically a full time 3 or 4 year route for those entering the profession. Funding is not available from NCTL for this route. Funding for course fees can be accessed by eligible trainees through tuition fee loans from Student Finance England . Assessment only (part-time) This route is for graduates with experience of working with children from birth to 5 years old who can demonstrate the Teachers’ Standards (Early Years) without further training. An example of this is an early years teacher from overseas who has knowledge and understanding of the early years foundation stage. Funding is not available from NCTL for this route, it’s self-funded. Bursary rates 2016 to 2017 Bursary rates are only available for the graduate entry route.

To be eligible for a bursary, the trainee must: meet all the entry requirements be taking a qualifying postgraduate early years ITT course hold a UK first degree with at least second-class honours, or equivalent be notified by you, the early years ITT provider, in writing that they’re eligible – you’ll determine whether a trainee is eligible to receive a bursary and whether they continue to receive it comply with the bursary conditions you set not already hold Early Years Teacher Status ( EYTS ) or early years professional status ( EYPS ) not have started and not completed EYTS and EYPS not be undertaking paid early years teaching work when receiving the bursary not be taking any other ITT course Funding principles All allocated funding is based on full-time places. A trainee is defined as full-time if their full-time equivalence ( FTE ) is more than 0.5. Trainees with an FTE of 0.5 or less will be classified as part-time. Trainees are funded for the number of days between the start date and the planned end date of their training (unless the trainee withdraws). This includes weekends and bank holidays. It also applies to trainees who start their training during the current academic year but aren’t due to complete until a later academic year. Funding is ring-fenced for each individual route allocation. For example, graduate entry allocated places can’t be used to recruit graduate employment based trainees. You may only use your allocated places for trainees who are eligible for our funding as defined in your grant offer agreement. All trainees on funded routes must have the right to study or work in the UK for at least the duration of training. We’ll not fund applicants who’ve previously started and not completed EYPS or EYTS . We’ll validate new trainees prior to registration. Withdrawals Trainees who withdraw from their programme attract funding between the start date of their programme and the date of withdrawal. Withdrawal data should be updated in our early years ITT data management system . We’ll recover any unused funding. Eligible trainees who withdraw from their course are entitled to be paid the training bursary for each month up to, and including, the full month in which they withdrew. Trainees will only be entitled to receive the bursary payment for that month if they are still on the course at the time the payment is made. You should not make any pro rata training bursary payments to trainees. In the event of withdrawal, you must suspend all bursary payments to the trainee immediately. You should calculate the amount of unused training grant funding and employer incentive payments from the point of withdrawal. You must be able to demonstrate how you have calculated this. We’ll not reimburse you for any payments made in error for trainees who have already withdrawn. We expect you to recover any overpayment from trainees and employers. You should email our early years team with notification of withdrawn candidates and unused funding immediately. Deferments If a trainee defers during their programme, we’ll continue to fund you for the trainee throughout the period of deferment up to the maximum of training grant and employer incentive awarded. The deferral period is a maximum of 1 year. A trainee might seek deferment more than once during the course of their training, which should be agreed with you. If you’ve any concerns regarding continued deferment by a trainee, please contact us to discuss this. During the deferral period you should hold on to the funding to be used when the trainee returns to their course. However, if the trainee subsequently doesn’t return to the training programme, we’ll recover any surplus funding. Sickness or special leave We’ll continue to provide funding up to the maximum amount for trainees who are away from their programme because of sickness or other special leave. If this absence will affect the trainee’s ability to meet the Teachers’ Standards (Early Years) within the time frame agreed, you should consider whether a deferment would be more appropriate. Funding mechanisms Funding for early years ITT will be distributed to you, the provider, not employers or individuals. The Department for Education’s grant funding agreement underpins the funding arrangements for early years ITT . This includes arrangements to recover unused funding and assurance processes. Your grant offer letter will incorporate financial expectations. Evidence that the monies are being spent appropriately will be sought through an annual grant report process. Assurance could also be gained through internal processes linked to the accreditation process such as internal visits and ITT provider health checks. Funding will be paid to you in 11 monthly instalments from September to July of the academic year. We’ll make the monthly payments through BACS via the Department for Work and Pensions ( DWP ) and you’ll receive payment within the first 7 working days of each month. Recipients of grant funding will receive remittance advice from DWP containing the amount of funding to be paid and the name of the ITT provider. You will be able to review your payment profile on the ITT Extranet. The first 2 payments will be based on allocated places. The amount may change at certain payment points to reflect the actual number of trainees recruited. All unused grant funding will be recovered that is as a result of: under-recruitment against allocated places training location changing trainee withdrawals Funding recovery At the end of the academic year, funding is adjusted to take account of the actual number and type of trainees who were recruited and who completed programmes during the year. We’ll recover all funding relating to unfilled places and withdrawals. This will include training grants, bursaries and the employer incentive. We’ll not allow funding from withdrawals to fund additional trainees. All funding from withdrawals will be recovered. We’ll compare the agreed amount of funding that you’re entitled to claim based on actual recruitment against the allocated early years ITT places. A repayment to us is based on the calculation of trainee withdrawals and under-recruitment against allocated places. If the amount claimed is less than that allocated, we’ll recover all of the unused funding we’ve paid. We’ll invoice you to recover any unused funding. Monitoring You must hold full records of all payments made to: trainees in receipt of bursaries, including details of the trainees’ academic qualifications achieved prior to starting early years ITT employers of trainees in receipt of employer incentives – the trainee must be an employee of the early years business. Sole traders and business partners aren’t eligible for an employer incentive, they’re classed as self-employed by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) . If the early years business is a limited company the owners and those working for the company are not classed as self-employed and can be eligible for an employer incentive We’ll seek assurance about the payments via the annual audit grant reporting process, which will need to be verified by your accounting officer and in line with the grant terms and conditions. We reserve the right to request these details at any point during the academic year for the purpose of monitoring quality and performance. In the event of any variances, particularly with regard to unclassified degrees, we reserve the right to contact you to request explanations of the variances and to seek further information. Data collection and management You’re required to share data on trainee applications, recruitment and employment outcomes with us. Recruitment data You’re required to inform us of your monthly recruitment data as outlined in Annex J of your grant offer letter. This is a live and on-going data collection to inform us of recruitment. Failure to supply this data within the required timeline may affect any future allocation decisions and could lead to the withholding of grant funding. Early years ITT trainee data You’re required to record details of all your early years ITT trainees, training programmes, and training outcomes on our early years ITT data management system . This must be kept up to date at all times and should accurately reflect any changes to the status of trainees, such as withdrawals and deferments. Trainees will have their own early years ITT course codes. All trainees must be registered with us and all records finalised and correct by 30 September of the current academic year. You’ll be asked to complete a validation declaration at this point to confirm that all entries have been checked as correct. This data is a condition of funding. We’ll use information in line with these dates to calculate the amount of funding that you are entitled to claim for the academic year. There will be 2 formal trainee data collection points, 31 January and 31 May. In addition, we expect you to keep your trainee data up to date each month. Financial assurance and audit We’ve a responsibility to ensure that public funds and assets generated from the allocation of training places are properly managed in line with the accreditation agreement. You’ll be required to satisfy us that you are operating all early years ITT funding in accordance with the terms and conditions of funding. These are set out in this funding guidance and should be adhered to in conjunction with part 1 of the grant funding agreement . You’re required to complete an audit grant report and send it to us by 31 December each year (this forms part of our assurance framework and asks for specific information regarding the annual spend for ring-fenced funding). You’re ultimately responsible to us for the proper stewardship of the funds paid to you. The requirements include keeping proper accounting records and preparation of accounts, consistent with our requirements. We expect you to produce monthly management accounts and have robust monitoring arrangements in place, including producing budget reports for the governing body. We may ask for financial information and conduct financial audits at any stage of the course by visiting your premises. We reserve the right to withdraw your funding if you don’t comply with financial reporting requirements."

/government/news/free-childcare-for-disadvantaged-2-year-olds-to-be-guaranteed-in-law,"Children’s Minister Sarah Teather today outlined the first steps in the government’s reform of early education. The new approach will improve the life chances of disadvantaged children by freeing up children’s centres so they focus their services on families that will benefit the most. Speaking ahead of the Daycare Trust conference in London, Sarah Teather said: Early years support for all families is important but our reform must benefit the most disadvantaged families first and foremost. We need to end cycles of deprivation by reaching children from as young as two, therefore giving them the best chance to learn and develop. These reforms are vital because we know that high-quality early education can have a dramatic impact on a child’s life chances in the longer term. Local authorities and professionals need the freedom to tailor support to suit local needs. There is no one-size-fits-all in early years. Every community, every parent, every child and every setting differs, and it is time for government to support a much more flexible approach to early years. The government will be much less prescriptive about the services children’s centres must provide in return for a commitment from providers to improve the quality of outcomes for the most disadvantaged children. At the Daycare Trust conference, the minister confirmed plans to increase flexibility, improve access to high-quality provision and reduce bureaucracy in early education. The reforms include intending to legislate so that disadvantaged 2-year-olds receive 15-hours of free early education a week starting from 2013 removing the requirement to offer full day care for Sure Start children’s centres in the most deprived areas, which is largely unused and taking resources away from the frontline reducing bureaucracy for professionals in Sure Start children’s centres in the most deprived areas by removing the requirement to hire someone with both qualified teacher and early years professional status. By 2013, ministers plan to put into legislation the commitment for the most disadvantaged two-year-olds to receive 15 hours of free early education per week. Ministers will seek the views of the early years sector and voluntary groups, to define disadvantage to ensure the funding is targeted on those children who would benefit the most. To give children’s centres the flexibility to target resources and services at the most disadvantaged, ministers intend to remove the requirement for children’s centres in the 30% most disadvantaged areas to provide 40-hours of full day care a week, which is not used in the majority of these centres. Due to low take-up, local authorities often have to subsidise provision out of budgets that should be used to provide other Sure Start services, including family support and work to reach out to vulnerable families in the local area. This does not mean children’s centres in disadvantaged areas will stop providing full day care. They should build their services around the free entitlement for 2-, 3- and 4-year-olds but local authorities should continue to tailor services to meet local demand. Evidence clearly demonstrates the positive impact of high-quality staff on the outcomes of children. Ministers trust frontline professionals to use their local knowledge and professional judgement to decide how to use the available evidence to determine the appropriate level of graduate support across their early years settings. Removing the requirement for professionals in Sure Start children’s centres in the most disadvantaged areas to have both qualified teacher and early years professional status will mean they have the flexibility to make better use of the resources available to them. As part of the government’s arm’s-length body review and ongoing commitment to channel as much resource as possible directly to the frontline, Children’s Minister Sarah Teather also announced the department is withdrawing investment from the Children’s Workforce Development Council (CWDC). The Secretary of State for Education has written to the chair of CWDC to confirm this decision and explain that the CWDC will cease to be a non-departmental public body with its functions brought into the department. In the letter, the Secretary of State praised the hard work and dedication of CWDC’s staff and acknowledged its significant contribution in leading workforce reform and improving life chances for children and young people since it was established in 2005. Michael Gove confirmed in his letter that the department’s staff will work closely with CWDC on a detailed plan for the transfer of work, to ensure that current business continues to be delivered and essential business maintained. The department’s officials will work with CWDC to continue to secure employers’ engagement in workforce development.

/government/publications/using-the-physical-environment-as-a-tool-for-teaching,"This good practice example shows how Netherfield Primary School makes highly effective use of resources and space to provide children with outstanding learning experiences. A range of teaching approaches, both formal and informal, sit side by side in a highly planned curriculum where both the indoor and outdoor environment are used creatively. A research-based approach was taken when setting up the environments, and a large staff team works together to seek ever better ways of ensuring that children get off to a good start. At this school, the headteacher is clear that ‘the environment is the best teaching tool we have’. This is part of a set of 8 Ofsted good practice examples showcasing good practice in early years to support the report: ‘Teaching and play in the early years – a balancing act?’ ."
/government/news/education-bill-gives-secretary-of-state-new-powers-to-intervene-in-underperforming-schools,"The Education Bill, published today, will help teachers raise standards in schools. It includes measures to root out bad behaviour, tackle underperformance and improve the way in which schools are held to account. Measures in the Bill include: extending the Secretary of State’s powers to intervene where schools are underperforming introducing smarter school inspections; Ofsted will now focus only on 4 core elements of schools - pupil achievement, teaching, leadership, and behaviour and safety measuring our education system against the best in the world - Ofqual will compare our exam standards against the highest performing countries Education Secretary Michael Gove said today: We’re lucky that there are many teachers doing a fantastic job. But there are still too many schools that simply aren’t good enough. We must learn from other countries which do things better. We’re giving more powers for teachers to do their job properly - the ability to impose better discipline - and freeing them from bureaucracy. The best schools will be freed from inspections so Ofsted will now concentrate on what matters - teaching and behaviour. But we also need tough new powers to take action when things go wrong. In the worst schools there will be new intervention powers. Ofsted will focus on the worst-performing schools where they are needed most. It is unacceptable that children should suffer in schools that are not doing a good job. Raising standards Subject to the passage of the Bill, the Secretary of State will now be able to direct a local authority to close schools that are judged to be in special measures, require significant improvement, or have failed to comply with a warning notice. He will also be able to direct local authorities to give a warning notice to an underperforming school. These new powers will mean the government can intervene whenever a school is not providing the kind of education children deserve. Ofsted The best school systems in the world are characterised by strong accountability, so in addition to recent changes to performance tables, the government is also reforming the school inspection system. Under the current Ofsted framework inspectors make at least 27 separate judgements. We are focusing inspection on 4 key areas: pupil achievement teaching leadership and management behaviour and safety We want inspectors to spend more of their time concentrating on teaching to drive improvement in educational standards. The Bill will also exempt ‘outstanding’ schools from routine inspection so they can be free to continue doing what they do so well. Ofsted will be able to focus their resources on the underperforming schools. Responding to these changes, Kate Dethridge, Head of Churchend Primary School, said: It is good news that there will be a reduction in the criteria against which we are inspected. At the end of the day, the most important thing is to be judged on the core purpose of raising standards. Schools should be trusted to achieve the right outcomes for their pupils, without having to be judged on the process to achieve those outcomes. It is also welcome that outstanding schools will be exempt from inspections. Constantly self-reviewing and improving the school, and maintaining standards, is a head’s core purpose. Going through the process of an Ofsted inspection is time-consuming and does not add any value in an outstanding school. Greg Martin, Executive Head of Durand Academy, said: In recent years monitoring mechanisms have become increasingly complex and we welcome the move today to streamline Ofsted inspections to focus on the things that matter most to parents - quality teaching, effective leadership, good behaviour and safety for every child. These are also the components of all great schools and Ofsted inspectors will now be able to work closely with improving schools to get these fundamentals right. Ofqual International league tables show we are not performing at the same level as many countries across the world. The government believes we must learn from the best education systems. That’s why the Bill puts a duty on Ofqual, the independent watchdog for qualifications, to compare our exam standards against the highest performing systems. It will ensure that England does not continue to fall behind other countries. Behaviour The Bill also gives teachers the power to tackle bad behaviour and maintain good discipline. The Bill will: give teachers powers to search for items that disrupt learning. Current rules mean children can’t be searched for items like hardcore pornography and video cameras. These items cause serious disruption to learning. Video cameras are used to record incidents of bad behaviour and post them online. The Bill will ensure teachers can search for any item banned by the school rules give school the final say in expelling violent pupils. Exclusion should be a last resort, but to ensure order in schools heads need to be able to exclude violent pupils. At the moment a head can exclude a pupil for carrying a knife or acting violently but their decision can be overruled and they can be forced to reinstate the pupil. The Bill will end this - heads’ decisions will be able to be reviewed but not overturned protect teachers from pupils telling lies. When violent pupils are punished they may react by making unfair allegations against teachers. These allegations can ruin careers and take good teachers out of the classroom for months on end. The Bill will protect teachers from pupils who tell lies. Teachers will remain anonymous until they are charged make it easier to impose detentions. Currently teachers have to give 24 hours notice to a child and parents for any after-school detention they want to issue. This stops immediate punishments and means children escape unpunished as teachers have to spend time outside of the classroom contacting parents. The Bill will remove the 24-hours notice requirement Responding to the Bill, James McAtear, Head of Hartismere Secondary School, said: These reforms will help to redress the balance in favour of good discipline in schools. They send out a strong message that our society is not willing to tolerate poor behaviour and that we will provide a safe and supportive environment in which every child can learn. Bureaucracy The government is also stripping away the overbearing and unnecessary red tape that takes up teacher time that would be better spent in the classroom or preparing lessons. The Bill includes measures to abolish expensive and unaccountable bureaucratic bodies.** **Currently there are too many quangos that take up schools’ time without leading to any real benefits to standards. The Bill will dissolve the General Teaching Council for England and the Qualification and Curriculum Development Agency. It will also abolish the School Support Staff Negotiating Body and the Training and Development Agency for Schools remove bureaucratic requirements on teachers and schools. Teachers tell us they have to spend hours outside of the classroom going to meetings and filling in forms because of bureaucratic requirements. It takes them away from the core purpose of improving learning. For example, schools have to produce a specific ‘school profile’ about themselves. The Bill will give schools the freedom to describe themselves how they want and not follow bureaucratic diktats. The Bill will also remove the duty on schools and colleges to cooperate with children’s trusts and for schools to have regard to the area’s Children and Young People’s Plan. Local authorities will no longer have to provide School Improvement Partners, which are often just expensive bureaucracy, to every school remove bureaucratic requirements on colleges, including the duties to: secure consent from the Skills Funding Agency before borrowing money promote the social and economic wellbeing of the local area have regard to guidance on consultation with students and employers Local authority powers to direct a college to invoke disciplinary procedures and appoint members to governing bodies will be removed. Responding to the measures on bureaucracy, Sue Barratt, Head of Bournville Junior School, said: Headteachers currently spend 15 or more hours a week on unnecessary paperwork. This time could be better spent doing more important things as a headteacher - doing what we’re there for, raising standards of teaching and learning in the school, and supporting our staff and pupils in the classroom and around the school. We really appreciate that the government is listening to the profession and realises that unnecessary bureaucracy is hindering schools from carrying out their core purpose of raising standards in education for all children. Larry Montagu, Head of St. Peter’s Catholic School in Gloucester, said: Any legislation that reduces bureaucracy and allows teachers to concentrate on their core purpose of helping children learn has got to be applauded. Dr Reena Keeble, Head of Canon Lane First School, said: I am pleased this Bill will cut bureaucracy - taking away paperwork gives us greater freedom to address children’s needs, which is what we are here for. Spending time doing admin or getting stats together for inspections and data collections takes you away from focusing on your core purpose of ensuring children are able to get an outstanding education. Penny Barratt, Head of the Bridge School (a special school), said: Schools will really welcome the removal and clarification of some statutory and non-statutory requirements. This will support the reduction of bureaucracy, which schools have to deal with on a day-to-day basis. The Education Bill had its first reading on Wednesday 26 January 2011 and is published today. Notes to editors A copy of the Bill is available on the House of Commons website. Other measures in the bill: As part of the Government’s ‘fairness premium’, the Bill also introduces a new entitlement to free early years provision for disadvantaged 2-year-olds, while maintaining a universal free entitlement for children aged 3 and 4 It repeals the duty on LAs to ensure every young person has access to 14 to 19 diplomas. We want schools and colleges to have the freedom to offer the qualifications that best serve their students. We will also give local authorities the freedom to target their support to those vulnerable and disadvantaged young people who they identify need it most It simplifies the current bureaucratic competition process required to open a new school, and gives preference to the opening of new free schools. The legislation relating to academies will be extended to enable 16 to 19 academies and academies providing alternative provision to be established so the benefits of free schools and academies can be extended to more pupils It ensures complaints about admissions arrangements at all schools, including academies, will go to the schools adjudicator so they are all dealt with consistently It simplifies the complex intervention arrangements in underperforming sixth-form colleges, removing the dual roles of local authorities and the Young People’s Learning Agency. These changes will ensure resources are spent where they are most needed - on the front line. With less central prescription and interference, many functions of these arm’s length bodies will fall away and ministers will be able to take responsibility and be held accountable for the continuing functions. The Bill will also take forward aspects of the changes to higher education student finance: change to interest rates on student loans and the regulation of fees for part-time students. All enquiries on these aspects should be taken to the Department for Business Innovation and Skills. [Contact:997]"

/national-curriculum,"Overview The ‘basic’ school curriculum includes the ‘national curriculum’ , as well as religious education and sex education . The national curriculum is a set of subjects and standards used by primary and secondary schools so children learn the same things. It covers what subjects are taught and the standards children should reach in each subject. Other types of school like academies and private schools don’t have to follow the national curriculum. Academies must teach a broad and balanced curriculum including English, maths and science. They must also teach religious education. Key stages The national curriculum is organised into blocks of years called ‘key stages’ (KS). At the end of each key stage, the teacher will formally assess your child’s performance. Age Year Key stage Assessment   3 to 4   Early years     4 to 5 Reception Early years Teacher assessments (there’s also an optional assessment at the start of the year)   5 to 6 Year 1 KS1 Phonics screening check   6 to 7 Year 2 KS1 National tests and teacher assessments in English, maths and science   7 to 8 Year 3 KS2     8 to 9 Year 4 KS2     9 to 10 Year 5 KS2     10 to 11 Year 6 KS2 National tests and teacher assessments in English and maths, and teacher assessments in science   11 to 12 Year 7 KS3     12 to 13 Year 8 KS3     13 to 14 Year 9 KS3     14 to 15 Year 10 KS4 Some children take GCSEs   15 to 16 Year 11 KS4 Most children take GCSEs or other national qualifications   Assessments By the end of each summer term the school must write a report on your child’s progress and talk it through with you. Children who are in years 2 and 6 at the moment will take the new national primary curriculum tests in 2016. Other compulsory subjects Children must also study: sex and relationships education (year 7 onwards) religious education ( RE ) They may not have to take exams in these subjects. Sex and relationship education Sex and relationship education ( SRE ) is compulsory from age 11 onwards. It involves teaching children about reproduction, sexuality and sexual health. It doesn’t promote early sexual activity or any particular sexual orientation. Some parts of sex and relationship education are compulsory - these are part of the national curriculum for science. Parents can withdraw their children from all other parts of sex and relationship education if they want. All schools must have a written policy on sex education, which they must make available to parents for free. Religious education Schools have to teach RE but parents can withdraw their children for all or part of the lessons. Pupils can choose to withdraw themselves once they’re 18. Local councils are responsible for deciding the RE syllabus, but faith schools and academies can set their own. Key stage 1 and 2 Compulsory national curriculum subjects at primary school are: English maths science design and technology history geography art and design music physical education (PE), including swimming computing ancient and modern foreign languages (at key stage 2) Schools must provide religious education (RE) but parents can ask for their children to be taken out of the whole lesson or part of it. Schools often also teach: personal, social and health education (PSHE) citizenship modern foreign languages (at key stage 1) Tests and assessments Year 1 phonics screening check The check will take place in June when your child will read 40 words out loud to a teacher. You’ll find out how your child did, and their teacher will assess whether he or she needs extra help with reading. If your child doesn’t do well enough in the check they’ll have to do it again in Year 2. Key stage 1 Key stage 1 tests cover: English reading English grammar, punctuation and spelling maths Your child will take the tests in May. You can ask the school for the test results. You’ll be sent the results of your child’s teacher assessments automatically. Key stage 2 Your child will take national tests in May when they reach the end of key stage 2. These test your child’s skills in: English reading English grammar, punctuation and spelling maths The tests last less than 4 hours. You’ll get the results in July. The school will send you the results of your child’s tests and teacher assessments. Key stage 3 and 4 Key stage 3 Compulsory national curriculum subjects are: English maths science history geography modern foreign languages design and technology art and design music physical education citizenship computing Schools must provide religious education ( RE ) and sex education from key stage 3 but parents can ask for their children to be taken out of the whole lesson or part of it. Key stage 4 During key stage 4 most pupils work towards national qualifications - usually GCSEs. The compulsory national curriculum subjects are the ‘core’ and ‘foundation’ subjects. Core subjects are: English maths science Foundation subjects are: computing physical education citizenship Schools must also offer at least one subject from each of these areas: arts design and technology humanities modern foreign languages They must also provide religious education ( RE ) and sex education at key stage 4.

/government/speeches/sarah-teather-on-reforming-early-years,"Children’s Minister Sarah Teather today confirmed plans for a reformed Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) that reduces bureaucracy for professionals, provides earlier intervention for children facing difficulties and better prepares young children for learning in school. The Government today responded to the consultation on the EYFS, and confirmed changes to be introduced from September 2012. Children’s Minister Sarah Teather said: People working in the early years, teachers, parents, and other professionals are supportive of our proposals which slim down the early years foundation stage, focus on children’s healthy development and make sure they are ready to learn when they enter Year 1. Building on consultation feedback, our changes, including the progress check at age two, will support families to give children the best possible start in life. We want to help young children achieve to the best of their abilities so they are not falling behind before they even reach school. As well as learning to speak and communicate, young children also need to learn through play how to read and write and use numbers. This is a vital foundation for future success at primary school and beyond. People working in the early years will get additional guidance and information so they feel confident to deliver the new EYFS. And a summary of the EYFS will be available for parents so they know what their child will be learning and what they should expect from their child’s early years setting. Dame Clare Tickell published an independent review of the EYFS in March this year. She recommended a slimmed down Early Years Foundation Stage for 0-5-year-olds, reducing the number of early learning goals from 69 to 17 and focusing on three prime areas of learning: communication and language, physical development and personal, social and emotional development. The Government is implementing Dame Clare’s recommendations for the EYFS. Further information Written Ministerial Statement from Children’s Minister Sarah Teather.

/government/speeches/written-ministerial-statement-by-michael-gove-on-education-funding,"Today I am announcing details of education funding for 2012-13. My announcement includes the Dedicated Schools Grant (DSG), funding for 16-19 education and training and capital funding for maintained schools, Academies, the voluntary aided sector and 16-19 provision. School funding As set out in the “Consultation on School Funding Reform”, issued in July, we will continue with the current methodology for funding schools in 2012-13 through the Dedicated Schools Grant (DSG). The underlying school budget will be kept at flat cash per pupil for 2012-13. To protect local authorities with falling pupil numbers we will continue with arrangements to ensure that no authority loses more than 2 per cent of its budget in cash terms. Although the overall schools budget will stay at the same level on a per pupil basis before the addition of the Pupil Premium, the actual level of each school’s individual budget will vary. It will depend on local decisions about how best to meet needs and priorities. This does mean that some schools will see budget reductions, either because they have fewer pupils or local changes to funding distribution. To protect schools from significant budget reductions, we will continue with a Minimum Funding Guarantee that ensures no school sees more than a 1.5 per cent per pupil reduction in 2012-13 budgets (excluding sixth form funding) compared to 2011-12 and before the Pupil Premium is added. Details of these arrangements, including per pupil funding for each local authority, are being sent to local authorities today and have been published on the Department for Education’s website. The “Consultation on School Funding Reform” set out proposals for the funding system from 2013-14. I am grateful to all those who have responded to these important issues. I am publishing today a report on the consultation responses: there was a good deal of consensus around some proposals, such as the factors to include in both any national and local formulae, and the need for careful transitional arrangements. However, the responses also reflect a variety of views over some of the key aspects of the system. We are now working on developing further proposals in light of the responses. Funding for 16-19 provision The Young People’s Learning Agency (YPLA) is today publishing a statement setting out the funding to be made available for 16-19 education and training for 2012-13. The Funding Statement shows that the Government plans to fund an increased number of places as we approach the raising of the participation age. We plan to fund 1,577,000 places in the 2012/13 academic year compared with the 1,543,000 learners we expect providers to have recruited in 2011/12. Transitional protection was introduced in 2011/12 in order to help schools and colleges to manage unit cost savings that need to be made. We will continue to provide transitional protection for these policy changes for 2012/13 and will continue to make this available until 2015/16. Capital funding Today’s capital announcement covers funding for 2012-13 and includes allocations for basic need (funding for additional pupil places), maintenance and devolved formula capital. This is a further one-year allocation. This will enable me to reflect, for subsequent allocations, the rapidly changing situation in local areas on both demographic growth and numbers of schools converting to Academy status. At a national level, overall capital funding remains the same as last year - £800 million to address the shortage in pupil places and £1.4 billion for maintenance, including £200 million for devolved formula capital. I have agreed however to change the methodology for allocating funding for pupil places to better reflect local need. Funding for pupil places needs to take account of the capacity of schools. For this reason, I have agreed that basic need allocations for 2012-13 will be decided using both numbers on roll and capacity data. That is, it combines the two methodologies used in 2011-12 for allocating basic need funding. Moving to this method will result in changes in levels of funding for some local authorities. Because of this, I have introduced a protection so that no local authority will receive, in 2012-13, less than 80 per cent of the funding they would have received had we taken the same approach as taken for 2011-12. This allocation does not include the additional £600 million for basic need allocated to my Department in the autumn statement. I am considering how best to allocate this funding. I will also consider how we can improve the collection of local data on pupil numbers and available school places so that allocations for the remainder of the spending review period are better targeted towards need. Maintenance funding for local authorities will remain at the same level as last year and will be allocated in the same way. Some local authorities will see a reduction because their maintained schools have converted, or are about to convert, to Academy status. Local authorities should take into account the maintenance needs of all maintained provision, including Sure Start Centres, when deciding how to prioritise this funding. I can also confirm the same funding levels for the Locally-Coordinated Voluntary Aided Programme (LCVAP) as in 2011-12 and we are taking the same approach to its allocation. Devolved Formula Capital will remain at similar levels to last year so that the limited capital available can be more strategically targeted. We have retained £276 million centrally to meet the maintenance needs of Academies. This amount is based on numbers of Academies already open and those due to open in the coming months. We expect local authorities to honour any commitments they have made to fund projects in their maintained schools, including where those schools may be intending to become Academies during the next year. The Academies central fund next year will be administered in a similar way to this year, and we will provide further details early in 2012 when we are ready to receive applications for funding. We will also consult with sponsors and Academy chains to explore options for giving them more flexibility to address the maintenance needs of their whole Academy estate. Capital funding for 16-19 provision Over £107 million of capital funding will be available in 2012-13 to meet maintenance and building needs of sixth form colleges and demographic pressures for new 16-19 places in schools, Academies and sixth form colleges. £59 million of this funding will be allocated to the sixth form college Building Condition Improvement Fund (BCIF) in 2012-13 to address priority building condition needs within the sixth form college sector. All sixth form colleges will remain eligible for Devolved Formula Capital (DFC) and it will remain at the same rate as 2011-12. In addition I want to ensure that funding is available to meet the need for additional places where there are demographic pressures in schools, Academies and sixth form colleges. I have therefore made a further £44 million available in the coming financial year for basic need funding for additional places for 16-19 year old students in these areas. This funding will also support the provision of new places in mainstream settings, including in FE colleges, for students with learning difficulties and disabilities. The Capital Review The consultation on the capital review ended in October and I intend to publish a final Government response to its recommendations in January 2012. The Priority School Building Programme Finally I would like to update the House on the latest position on the Priority School Building Programme (PSBP). Partnerships for Schools (PfS) is currently reviewing applications to ensure there is a fair and rigorous selection of schools for admission to the programme. Until applications have been fully assessed, I will not be able to announce which schools will be in the programme. I understand the high level of interest in this programme and expect to be able to make an announcement in the New Year. More details about today’s capital allocations are being sent to local authorities and will be published on my Department’s website at: www.education.gov.uk . A list of resources associated with today’s announcement can be found at Annex A and I shall also make copies available in parliamentary libraries.

/government/news/press-briefing-morning-22-march-2013,"Putin call and Cyprus Asked about the PM’s call with President Putin, the PMS said they had discussed a range of issues including Cyprus and Syria. The PM’s view was that the situation in Cyprus was an issue for the Eurozone, but it was important the banks remained stable and the situation was resolved as quickly as possible. Asked whether the UK would send more money as a contingency for serving soldiers, or whether the FCO was reviewing travel advice, the PMS said the situation was fluid and both positions would be kept under review. Immigration Questioned on the PM’s stance on immigration, the PMS said that the PM’s view remained unchanged. He wanted a grip on immigration, and to see the annual number of net migrants reduce from hundreds of thousands to tens of thousands. The DPM had also raised the issue of bond deposits in a speech, and the Home Office was working on the detail of the proposal. Help to Buy Asked about the Help to Buy scheme announced in the Budget, the PMS said that the intention was to help people onto, and move up, the housing ladder. The process of technical consultation was underway. The PM was confident that the consultation would deliver the process that fulfilled the policy intention. Female offenders Asked to comment on Justice Minister Helen Grant’s position on female offenders, the PMS said that the PM’s view on offenders and reducing crime had previously been set out. Vicky Pryce Asked whether Vicky Pryce should lose her honour, the PMS said it was a matter for the Forfeiture Committee. Benefits Questioned on whether it was right that jobcentres had targets for sanctions, the PMS said that it was not government policy and that the DWP was investigating. Gas supplies Asked whether the PM was concerned about gas supplies, the PMS said that gas supplies were not running out. Mid Staffs Asked how the PM would restore confidence in the NHS after the Mid Staffordshire Trust issues, the PMS said that the PM had already responded to the Francis Report findings. Childcare and stay at home parents Asked whether the PM thought parents who stayed at home to raise their children had any worth in society, the PMS said the PM did. While there had been reports that the latest childcare announcement would not help parents staying at home, the key point was that the government was addressing the affordability of childcare. It was important to note that marriage tax breaks were also still in the coalition agreement."

/government/news/more-than-100-free-schools-applications-approved,"Education Secretary Michael Gove today approved 102 new free school applications to open in 2014 and beyond, delivering around 50,000 new school places. There are already 81 open free schools, with a further 109 aiming to open in September and beyond. In total, all currently approved free schools would deliver 130,000 new school places when full. Free schools are state-funded schools independent of local authority control. They are run by teachers - not local or central government bureaucrats. They have the freedom to decide the length of the school day and term, the curriculum, and how they reward their teachers and spend their money. Many of the free schools approved today will be based in areas of deprivation, or where there is a shortage of school places, like the schools open or approved before them: 72% of all free school approvals and 91% of primary approvals will go towards meeting basic need. Ninety per cent of mainstream schools (excluding 14 to 19 schools) are in areas of basic need or deprivation More than half (64%) of the mainstream schools are expected to be located in the 50% most deprived communities in the country. 44% of the mainstream schools announced today are expected to be located in the 30% most deprived communities in the country Among the free school proposals approved today are: The Jane Austen College in Norwich A secondary school for 1,100 students that will specialise in English. It has been proposed by inspirational headteacher, Rachel De Souza. The school will have a focus on cultural literacy and traditional academic subjects, with every pupil studying a language until 16 years of age, with the option to study Latin. National Autistic Society (NAS) Free Schools NAS has had 2 schools for children and young people with autism approved today. One, for 60 pupils, will be in east Cheshire and the other, for 78 pupils, will be in Lambeth. This builds on NAS’s first free school that is due to open in Reading in September. East London Academy of Music (ELAM) A music school for 16- to 19-year-olds in Tower Hamlets. The school is the brainchild of Will Kennard, one half of production duo Chase and Status, who wants to give talented students from deprived areas the opportunity to be successful. Will brought together a group of talented and innovative teachers and professionals with experience of education. With the support of the music industry they created a vision for ELAM, a school where any pupil with potential can realise success. Sir Nick Williams, former headteacher of the BRIT School, is supporting the school. North Somerset Enterprise and Technology College in Weston-Super-Mare A 700-pupil 14 to 19 free school proposed by the local Weston FE College. The free school will deliver a full curriculum, with an emphasis on STEM subjects. At KS4, all students will be entered for the English Baccalaureate and additional GCSEs, or will combine their core subjects with vocational level 2 subjects. In total, 70 of the applications approved today are from teachers, existing schools, and educational organisations. Twenty-four of the approved free schools – 8 special free schools and 16 alternative provision free schools – will serve the most vulnerable children and young people. This adds to the 5 special and 12 alternative provision free schools that are on course to open from September 2013, and Harmonize Academy, an alternative provision free school, that opened in April this year. Of the 81 free schools already open, 6 are alternative provision free schools and 3 are special free schools. There are fewer schools approved this year with a faith designation or ethos. Fifteen will be faith designated, compared with 20 last year. Ten will have a faith ethos, compared with 13 last year. Today’s announcement underlines the continuing demand for free schools. More local communities want a different or better school to meet the needs of their children and to help drive up standards in their local area. Education Secretary Michael Gove said: There are many innovators in local communities set on raising standards of education for their children. I am delighted to approve so many of their high-quality plans to open a free school. Free schools are extremely popular with parents and are delivering strong discipline and teaching excellence across the country. The groups will now finalise their plans in readiness to open from September 2014. Chief among their tasks will be to secure their site. The department has co-developed a website - www.gov.uk/find-government-property - with the Cabinet Office that lists all surplus government property available to buy or rent, including those suitable for free schools. Changes to planning laws at the end of May 2013 will also make it easier for free schools to move into their preferred site. The list of approved schools will be published on the department’s website. Notable examples include: Perry Beeches III in Birmingham This secondary free school is the latest to be set up by the excellent Perry Beeches Academy Trust. The trust has a strong track record with their first school, Perry Beeches I improving pupils’ key stage 4 attainment from 20% 5 or more A* to C including English and maths in 2006 to 75% by 2011. This proposal aims to provide an outstanding traditional education, with a strong emphasis on behaviour, academic achievement, and smart appearance of pupils. Perry Beeches has links with a number of key figures in Birmingham who will teach students about the city’s rich history and enrich their school experience. Queen Elizabeth Grammar School in Blackburn It is one of the oldest independent schools in Lancashire and will join the non-selective state sector. The proposal is supported by Jack Straw. The ethos of the school will be maintained through high aspirations allied with academic breadth and challenge. It will be based on the national curriculum, (and in the foundation stage on the early years statutory framework), with a strong emphasis on developing high levels of literacy and numeracy. There will be a wide programme of enrichment for all students delivered by well-trained specialist teachers, with 64% possessing a 2.1 or first class degree. The school’s rich co-curricular life will be maintained through a newly designed extended day and on-going Saturday sporting programme. Liverpool Institute of the Performing Arts (LIPA) Free School in Liverpool This will be a creative arts primary free school established by LIPA and Edge Hill University. LIPA was co-founded in 1996 by its lead patron, Sir Paul McCartney, and principal, Mark Featherstone-Witty. The LIPA Free School will immerse children in the creative arts to enrich teaching and learning in the early development of literacy and numeracy. Younger pupils will use the art work at Tate Liverpool as the stimulus for creative writing and older pupils will work with the Everyman Theatre and use their ticket sales data as a real life maths resource. XP School in Doncaster This is a teacher-led proposal drawing on the practices of charter schools in the USA. XP will aim to prepare pupils to be successful in the adult world by facilitating authentic, real world experiences. As well as mastery of subject knowledge, the pupils will gain skills critical to readiness for further/higher education and lifelong success, such as; literacy, numeracy problem-solving, critical thinking, collaboration, creativity, persistence toward excellence and active citizenship. All projects will be rigorously mapped to the national curriculum in terms of standards, content and skills at both key stage 3 (KS3), and an appropriate programme of GCSEs and A levels. This will be tracked across each project, and across each year, to prevent gaps and ensure breadth and balance. The Family School in London This will be a 5 to 14 alternative provision free school for children with complex psychological, family and mental health problems. Combining teaching with elements from the most up-to-date CAMHS practice (including the use of multi-family groups), the Family School will both ease behavioural and mental health-related blocks to learning and provide learning opportunities that will keep pace, day-by-day, with the pupil’s ability to learn and achieve. A central feature of the programme will be that children will remain pupils, in a school context that is non-stigmatising. Treatments, whether individual, family or multi-family in nature, will for the most part be delivered either in the Family School itself or in the mainstream school. East London Academy of Music (ELAM) in Tower Hamlets This is a teacher-led proposal for post-16 students. ELAM will work in conjunction with the British music industry to educate through the music. The school will bring world class music provision to the heart of east London. The proposal is supported by Sir Nick Williams, the former principal of the BRIT School, who will be a governor of ELAM. ELAM will develop young musical talents into industry-ready professionals. It is designed to specifically improve the outcomes of young people from the diverse backgrounds found within these east London. North Somerset Enterprise and Technology College in Weston-Super-Mare This proposal is for 14- to 19-year-olds from all backgrounds and abilities, who can benefit from the partnership with employers and universities. Its focus will be on high-quality teaching with an emphasis on STEM subjects. Student will benefit from practical sessions and enrichment activities and apply them to real life situations. Work placements will be built into their timetable so they gain valuable experience and skills which will give them an advantage in future job and university applications. The ethos of the college is designed to prepare students for the world of work and higher education. It will operate in business hours and a longer working year of 39 weeks. Students will wear business dress and work on live-project briefs set by employers. The Jane Austen College in Norwich This secondary free school will specialise in English. It has been proposed by an existing academy sponsor, East Norfolk Academies Trust, led by Rachel De Souza, its CEO and an inspirational school leader with a track record in transforming schools. The college will follow the national curriculum, with an emphasis on traditional academic subjects, and pupils will take GCSEs and the English Baccalaureate. There will be a focus on high academic achievement and cultural literacy and pupils will have the option to study Latin. The college will have a joint sixth-form with the Sir Isaac Newton Sixth Form Free School, which is opening in September 2013. The National Autistic Society (NAS) Free Schools in Lambeth and Cheshire East These are 2 proposals from the NAS for 4- to 19-year-olds with autism. The NAS already has a free school set to open in Reading in September 2013. They will focus on core subjects - English, maths, science and ICT – and will offer GCSEs and A Levels, as well as AQA and ASDAN functional skills qualifications. Pupils will also be taught life skills and social communication. The Seva School in Coventry This will be a co-educational, Sikh school in Coventry for 4- to 16-year-olds. The proposer group, the Sevak Education Trust was formed by a group of parents and community members who have lived and studied in Coventry. The group aims to deliver excellent educational development through a framework supporting the wellbeing of all pupils. They plan to follow the national curriculum in English and science at key stages 1 and 2. They will deliver the ‘Math in Focus’ curriculum - the Singaporean model used to great effect by Ark Schools. At key stage 3 they will deliver an ‘enhanced national curriculum’ over 2 years which will allow them to focus on GCSEs (including the EBacc) and BTEC courses for 3 years. The school will also offer catch up sessions for pupils who fall behind and Saturday enrichment and extra-curricular activities for all pupils Notes to editors This link will take you to a list of all free schools in the pre-opening stage As of 22 May 2013: 24 free schools opened in September 2011. 55 free schools opened in September 2012. 1 opened in January 2013 – St Mary’s Dilwyn CofE Primary School 1 opened in April 2013 – Harmonize Free School a further 109 are aiming open this September and beyond. after a rigorous application process, including having to demonstrate clear parental demand, 102 groups were successful in their application and interview and move into the pre-opening stage all applicant groups were required to provide details of the individuals involved in the project, and these individuals undergo checks carried out by the Department for Education’s Due Diligence Unit throughout the entire approval process.

This includes undertaking a statutory consultation in their local area and taking steps to recruit their school’s principal designate, with the final aim of securing a funding agreement with the Secretary of State – which will allow the school to open Capital funding for these projects is still to be decided The next application window to open a free school will open in September 2013 [Contact:997]"
/government/news/message-from-michael-gove-regarding-funding-reform,"Dear Colleague, This session we have made further progress on reforming our school system so as to compete with the best in the world. New measures on discipline have come into force giving heads and teachers greater authority to search pupils; the power to insist on same-day detentions and, most importantly, to exclude violent pupils without any threat of having them re-instated. GCSEs have been toughened up. For pupils starting courses this September, we’re ending re-sits and bite-sized modules as well as reintroducing marks for spelling, punctuation and grammar. More than 40% of secondary schools have now taken up our offer to convert to academy status and we’ve found new sponsors for over 100 of the worst primaries in the country. The first 24 free schools are up and running with more than 50 due to open this September. The pupil premium has been increased to £600 per pupil, providing additional support to the most deprived children. It now supports all children whose parents have taken up free school meals at any point in the past 6 years. Today I have announced the next steps in reforming the school funding system to make it fairer and more transparent. The current system is not only ludicrously bureaucratic, it is also unfair as schools in different parts of the country are not funded on a rational basis. Moreover, the sheer complexity of the system gives schools less incentive to respond to the needs of local parents by expanding or establishing new provision. Of course, trying to simplify a complex system is itself an extremely complex task. In our last consultation we sought views on the introduction of a national funding formula, which would distribute money to local authorities based on the current needs of pupils. We also proposed simplifying the way that local authorities distribute that money to schools so that the whole process is more transparent and supports the needs of pupils. Support for reform was widespread but responses also suggested this model would need careful planning. Getting the components and implementation of a fair national funding formula right is critical and we need to manage transition carefully so there is the minimum disturbance for schools. In the current economic climate, stability is crucial. We will, therefore, begin the process of reform by simplifying local funding arrangements, before moving to a new national funding formula during the next spending review period. The document we have published today sets out our first steps towards introducing a national funding formula and explains how the system will operate from 2013-14. The key changes are: A significant reduction in the factors local authorities can consider when constructing school formula - down to 10 from the 37 used around the country at the moment. This will make it much easier for schools to understand the rationale behind their budgets. Much greater delegation of funding to schools - apart from a small fund to cover their statutory duties, LAs will no longer be able to top-slice school budgets. Instead schools forums will decide whether or not to pool funding to pay for LAs to provide services. These simplifications will allow us to fund academies on exactly the same formula as maintained schools in the future - as opposed to with a year’s lag under the system inherited from the previous Government. Academies will continue to receive an additional grant to cover services that are provided by LAs to maintained schools from formula grant and our plans to introduce a national approach will deliver a simpler system which gives equivalent funding to academies and local authorities for these functions. Regulations regarding schools forums will be strengthened so that they operate more transparently and efficiently Schools will continue to receive the stability they need. No school will lose more than 1.5% of funding per pupil for 2013-14 and 2014-15. The combined effect of these changes will be a very significant simplification of school funding that will lay the ground for further moves towards a national funding formula during the next spending review period. We will also simplify arrangements for funding early years provision and will introduce a new approach for funding high-need pupils from 0 to 25. This will provide better support for pupils with high needs as well as giving greater choice to parents. Copies of the document setting out these changes - ‘School funding reform: Next steps towards a fairer system’ - are available at www.education.gov.uk/consultations .

/government/news/4-million-to-fund-free-nursery-places-in-15-areas,"The trials will test out ways of making sure that enough nursery places and staff are available in the right areas so that every disadvantaged two-year-old can benefit. They will also look at how 15 hours a week of free early learning and childcare for two-, three- and four-year-olds could be offered more flexibly to help support parents juggle work and family life. Children’s Minister Sarah Teather said: High quality early education is the foundation of a child’s healthy development and future success at school and beyond. It’s simply not good enough that children from poorer families are less likely to access good quality early education than their wealthier peers - even though they stand to benefit the most. That’s why I’m pleased to announce that 15 local authorities have been provided with funding to look at how best to deliver the free entitlement for the two-year-olds that need it the most. We hope that local authorities across the country will learn from these pilots before the scheme is rolled out nationally to all disadvantaged two year olds in 2013. In addition, from today a new, fairer and more transparent funding system for nurseries and other early years providers will be implemented in all local authorities. The Early Years Single Funding Formula will require local authorities to fund providers by the number of children rather than places. This will mean that the funding follows the child and won’t be wasted on empty places. It will help ensure that nurseries are making the best effort to fill their places by attracting and encouraging more families to take up free nursery education for their children. To make sure that funding is focused on supporting children from disadvantaged families who will benefit most from nursery education, every local formula must also include an amount of money to specifically target the most needy children. Notes to editors The Government confirmed last year that it was protecting funding for free early education for three- and four-year-olds and it would be providing additional funding to extend free early education to the most disadvantaged two-year-olds.

/government/speeches/sarah-teather-article-in-nursery-world-on-early-education-and-disadvantaged-children,"Readers will know how committed this Government is to the early years - giving every child, regardless of their family circumstances, the opportunity to thrive and flourish. You will have seen at first hand the impact high quality early education can have on children’s life chances, but particularly for the most disadvantaged. It’s just not good enough that children from poorer families are still much less likely to access good quality early education and childcare than their wealthier peers - even though they stand to benefit the most. Evidence shows that less than half of all children who live in the most deprived areas achieve a good level of development at age 5 compared with nearly 70% of those living in the least deprived areas. That is why we have protected funding for free early education for 3- and 4-year-olds and have secured additional funding to provide free early education for the most disadvantaged 2-year-olds - despite the tough economic climate. It’s no accident that extending the free entitlement to the most disadvantaged 2-year-olds is the first clause in the Education Bill. We’re clear how important it is to the future prospects of so many children that we get this right. We moved a step closer to realising this ambition recently as all parties welcomed the extension of the free entitlement during the Education Bill Committee debate. In delivering this free entitlement, I know that many providers are doing an excellent job within the funding they receive, and we want to work with the sector to enable others to learn from their example. While funding levels are a matter for local authorities, we have made provision for 2-year-old places to be funded at a higher rate than 3- and 4-year-olds to reflect the higher ratio requirements for this age group. I know that some providers have concerns about the levels of funding they receive from their local authority. We are listening to those concerns and we are taking action to support providers: All local authorities will introduce the early years single funding formula from April. This is a first step in improving efficiency and transparency in the way funding is distributed to providers in all sectors. Later this year we will be consulting on the future of early education funding in the long term as part of the school funding review. We are working to reduce burdens on providers who deliver free early education, minimise prescription from central government and allow more discretion at a local level. We will be working closely with colleagues from across the sector to streamline the code of practice and childcare sufficiency guidance. Funding for free entitlement places is just one part of a broader package of public support that providers can access. Many receive training and other assistance from their local authority to support improvements in quality and secure sufficient childcare provision. I hope that many providers will continue to choose to be part of the free entitlement scheme, offering a fantastic service to all families. But I accept that - for some - delivering the free entitlement may not fit within their business models and they may decide to opt out. During the Education Bill debate we reinforced our commitment to a universal entitlement to early education for all 3- and 4-year-olds that is completely free to parents. For the avoidance of any doubt, we do not see top-up fees as an answer to the concerns that some providers have expressed. The work to slim down the Code of Practice will not change the position on top-up fees, which are effectively prohibited by primary legislation. It is, however, a good opportunity to make sure all providers and local authorities fully understand the principles of the free entitlement - including what they can and cannot charge parents for. It is legitimate for providers to charge parents for lunch, additional activities or for additional hours outside of the free entitlement, but it is unacceptable for parents’ access to the free entitlement to be made in any way conditional on the purchase of these extras. We’re absolutely clear that making parents pay to access their free entitlement would be an insurmountable financial barrier for many families. It would mean that the very children who have the most to benefit from free provision would be unable to access it at all. As a government committed to tackling social inequality and supporting the most disadvantaged families, this isn’t something we would support."

/government/speeches/elizabeth-truss-speaks-about-early-years-teachers,"Thank you, it’s a pleasure to be here. I felt I could only show my face at Policy Exchange if I had delivered on your excellent report last year - early years pupil premium and Teach First in early years - so phew! To misquote Beatrice and Sidney Webb - I’ve seen the future and it is in Bolton. Jack Hatch head of the St Bede’s Academy Group took me on a whirlwind tour of the operation. I visited both Little Rainbows in Leigh, a day nursery, and Baby Bede in Bolton - which operates in tandem with the St Bede’s school nursery. Jack who also has a nursery in Wigan, is opening a childminder agency in Bolton this September. There is also talk of expanding 1 of the nurseries up the age range to open a new primary. There is comprehensive training and progression for all of the team - who burst with enthusiasm. Parents have flexibility of slots between 7.30am in the morning and 6pm in the evening, from 15 hours a week to full time. All of the operations are Ofsted good or outstanding. And parents paying for extra hours pay less than two thirds of the cost of an average place in the North West. This is a fantastic example of how a teacher-led operation, with no boundaries between different types of provision can mean great quality and value for children and parents. Mind the gap At a recent cross-government meeting, I was asked - what does success in the early years look like? At the moment, there is an 18 month vocabulary gap between children on low incomes and children on high incomes when they arrive at school. Success must be: there is no gap. This is possible. And it’s what we’re working to achieve. As Sir Michael Wilshaw said last week: Many children enter formal schooling already behind. Once behind, their disadvantage often becomes entrenched….[but] there is nothing inevitable about the link between poverty and failure. Focusing on quality We have been getting rid of unnecessary red tape, prescription and bureaucratic box-ticking - because it is outcomes that matter. And as Sir Michael says, for too long we have been stuck in an alphabet soup of terminology. A child is a child - whether they come from wealth or poverty they need the same nurture, love and learning in the early years. A teacher is a teacher - regardless of whether they are teaching a 14-year-old the cosine rule or helping a 3-year-old speak in full sentences. Of course teaching in the early years needs to be age appropriate. Sir Michael Wilshaw has rightly highlighted that when parents count the stairs as they carry their child to bed, when they read a toddler stories and sing nursery rhymes, when they guide them so they can play well with other children, it is teaching. And that is what happens in high quality nurseries. It’s not about starting school work at an early age. No one in this debate believes that. It’s about developing the language, communication and social skills so that children are ready to learn when they are at school. And the way success is judged has to be the outcome. Previously different providers have been on different frameworks, school nurseries assessed in a different way from day nurseries and childminders. That isn’t right - and I am pleased there now will be a level playing field. I say to nurseries and childminders whether you are in the state or private or voluntary sector, in a school or in a chain, in an agency or independent - what matters is that you provide safe and high quality childcare that meets the needs of all children - and doesn’t allow any to fall behind. We value the important work you do equally. In future you will be held to account on the same basis. School nurseries I agree with Sir Michael that some of the best quality early education can be found in schools. We know that teacher-led care leads to the best outcomes, and we know that in deprived areas, 41% of staff in school nurseries are teachers with support, which compares to only 10% in private nurseries. That’s why we think schools should lead improvement in early years - working with all providers - and we are making it easier for school nurseries and high quality day nurseries to expand. To listen to some of the debate last week you’d think that school nurseries were a new invention. In fact, the first school nursery was open by 1823; the Butler Education Act in 1944, made it clear that local authorities should provide nursery schools, or, nursery classes for all children whose parents wanted them. So we have a long and proud history of good quality school nurseries. A third of early years places are in schools - and in some London boroughs it’s over 80%. But for too long, it’s been difficult for schools to open new nursery provision and to provide the flexibility modern families need. Some local authorities have said “we already have enough places in our borough” and have blocked schools (and other providers) that want to open a nursery. The vast majority of school nurseries offer only a standard 9 to 12 or 12 to 3 slot. Not easy for a parent who works 2 days a week or works shifts, trying to combine childcare with work and other commitments. So we’ve made it the case that every school - local authority, academy or free school (independent schools can do this already) can now lower the age range to cater for 3- and 4-year-olds without having to go through a legal process or submit burdensome business cases; and can open a nursery for the whole day from 8am to 6pm. Under this government, every school in the country has been given the power to open a nursery. That means school nurseries can offer the free 15 hours of care flexibly for parents - for example, offering three 5 hour slots to suit a part time job. I know that Jack Hatch from St Bede’s offers a deal to parents at his nursery, giving them the free hours plus lunch for just an extra £1.40 - an affordable proposition for many parents. And when that lunch involves homemade pasties with Lancashire cheese - obviously with healthy veg too - I know I’m up for it! We have also enabled school nurseries to extend their provision to 2-year-olds, and they can allow parents to use their funded hours flexibly within that. Like Evelyn Street School in Warrington, another nursery I visited in the North West, which offers top-quality provision from 8am to 6pm for children of 2-, 3- and 4-years-old - giving parents the flexibility to pick and choose the sessions that work best for their family. Helping private nurseries too We also want to see more great quality private and voluntary nurseries as well. Purnima will rightly point out that quality is improving. I recognise the efforts of providers to increase the level of qualifications. There is huge passion and commitment from staff who are working towards early years teacher status - it is a very heartening part of my postbag. We do want to see good quality private providers expand. Which is why we have removed the planning restrictions which are one of the biggest headaches facing providers who want to expand or set up from scratch. As of yesterday, it will be quicker, simpler and cheaper for nurseries to open in buildings not currently used for childcare - making it possible to convert office without planning applications. This is a huge opportunity to make childcare more accessible for parents and children - just think of the opportunities for businesses to offer onsite nurseries for their employees. And if high-quality private providers want to expand by delivering more government funded early education places, we have made that easier too. Before they would need to be approved by a separate local authority check. We’ve ended that. A level playing field and a system that is ‘Better Together’ In its first separate early years report to Parliament, Ofsted included school nurseries, private nurseries childminders - this is good - previously seen as separate. I am very firmly of the view that early years are better together. We want teachers and nurseries in the driving seat of improvement. As we see in schools, we want to see strong providers working with weaker providers to improve practice, and a school-led system. We’ve already got a network of teaching schools - outstanding schools working with neighbouring schools to provide top-quality staff training and development - will be playing a much larger role in the early years and they will reach out to all providers. Some are already doing this brilliantly - like St Bede’s, which I mentioned earlier. And Bristol, where in March last year, a consortium of 3 nursery schools with children’s centres were awarded teaching school designation, working closely with the primary teaching schools in the area with the local colleges and universities. The lead teachers are drawn from the nursery schools and from private and voluntary sector providers. The consortium provides a vast array of proven training and support packages. Over 800 practitioners benefited last year, helping close the gap in early years outcomes in Bristol. We now have over 100 teaching schools with nurseries and over 1,000 more schools with nurseries formally linked into teaching school alliances. We have 16 nursery schools that are teaching schools. But we want to strengthen those links even further and make them more widely available. So I’m delighted to announce that 20 teaching schools are establishing new links with early years providers in their area. On a national level the NDNA and 4children have been sharing the best ways of deploying teachers whether or not the nursery is in a school or run by a private provider. Working together, driving up standards together; building a self-improving system for children from birth right through to 18 - led by teaching schools and nurseries. School Direct (early years) And we don’t just want to schools and nurseries to lead training and support. We want you to develop the next generation of early years teachers. I can announce we are extending School Direct to the early years for the first time - meaning that nurseries will have the ability to train early years teachers at the “Play Doh–face”. As a first stage, 59 School Direct (early years) places have been allocated for September 2014 to 6 early years teaching schools and the large nursery chain, Bright Horizons, a shared project across the maintained and private sector. If it works out as well as we hope - and School Direct is already working very well in schools - next year will be bigger and better, and I want many more schools and nurseries to get involved. This is a fundamental part of the teacher-led, self-improving system - putting you in charge of developing the next generation of talent. Early years teachers But one of the most important ways to drive up standards is making sure that early years have more top-quality staff. I want to say to those nurseries who don’t have high quality staff, and struggle to recruit - we want to help you get the staff and support you need. So we’ve improved the specialised training for early years teachers; and introduced special Teachers’ Standards and the same rigorous entry requirements as primary teacher training. We have had a 25% increase in places this year because of high demand from students. We are offering generous bursaries for trainees on the graduate entry route; and giving incentives of £14,000 per trainee to employers who support their graduate staff getting trained. We are also offering bursaries of £3,000 for top quality apprentices to train as early years educators. Teach First in the early years The other way to bring the best graduates into early years is through Teach First, and I’m glad we’ve got an example here today. Last year - 16 bright Teach First recruits started a 2-year training programme to give them an understanding of working with children from birth to 3. I can announce that from this summer, we are expanding the programme to around 50 more graduates. This will help provide early years with passionate, dedicated ambassadors and leaders for the future. Max [Gregory, on the panel] will be able to tell us more about his experiences at Napier in a minute - so first, let me report that his headteacher called Max and his colleague “outstanding teachers who inspire and challenge children to achieve their best…[and] make a significant contribution to the school in raising standards”. Last week, Sir Michael set out 4 challenges for government - about the 2-year-old offer, pupil premium, admissions, and streamlining regulation. Tax free childcare is worth up to £2,000 per child and for working families on the lowest incomes up to 85% of childcare costs are to be met under universal credit. More than 100,000 low income 2-year-olds are now in high-quality places thanks to the 2-year-old programme. And our early years pupil premium - £50 million in 2015 to 2016 - will give providers extra money for disadvantaged 3- and 4-year-olds - this links the 2-year-old programme to the school pupil premium. Finally, we are making the system much simpler, easier to understand for parents, and helping nurseries to invest in quality whilst keeping prices in line with what parents can afford. Costs are stabilising. For the first time in 12 years - the costs of childcare in England are falling, after taking into account inflation. Compare for example the cost of nursery places for 2-, 3- and 4-year-olds. Flat in England - rising by 8% in Scotland and 13% in Wales. Quality is rising and an immense amount of effort is going in to improving practice by all providers and using funding more efficiently and effectively. But there’s still further to go. As Sir Michael said, the most important measure of success for the early years sector is whether the poorest children are doing as well as their better off peers by the time they start school. There should be no more gap. There should be no 5-year-olds already 18 months behind. This is why we need a teacher-led, self-improving system which is judged on its outcomes. By working together, we can achieve it - and eliminate that gap for good."
/government/news/free-pre-school-education-deputy-prime-minister-hails-a-revolution,"Two-year-olds to benefit from extended pre-school education offer early The deputy prime minister is today hailing a transformation in free early education as he announces a shake-up of the way it is delivered. The changes include a huge boost for hundreds of 2-year-olds who will get access to free childcare earlier than originally billed. At the moment, all 3- and 4-year-olds are eligible for 15 hours of free early education per week. 2-year-olds from the most disadvantaged backgrounds were due to start receiving free pre-school education from 2013, but the deputy prime minister wants to see the programme rolling out early from this September. The deputy prime minister is announcing a series of new changes to childcare, including: Early roll-out of free pre-school education for 2-year-olds in 10 areas - these areas will trial the entitlement, with just under 1,000 2-year-olds set to benefit from this September. Greater flexibility for parents - the hours in which parents can bring in their children for their free place will be extended by two hours. Currently, parents are restricted by having to drop their children off no earlier than 8am and picking them up no later than 6pm. This will be extended to 7am - 7pm. Giving parents the option to spread their free nursery place over two days rather than three. Under the current rules, hours have to be divided over a minimum of 3 days. This doesn’t offer enough flexibility for parents who work part time, for example. Currently, many working parents are unable to take up all of the hours available to them because of this. Revised statutory guidance making absolutely clear parents do not have to pay to access their child’s free early education place - this follows concerns that some free nursery places are being made conditional on parents being able to make additional payments. Currently, more than 800,000 3- and 4-year-olds nationally access up to 15 hours of free early education every week. The government is pledging to extend free childcare to around 150,000 of the least advantaged 2-year-olds from September 2013, rising to around 260,000 in September 2014. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said: We’re revolutionising the early start our children get in life - there will be more free childcare, it will be higher quality, and it will be more flexible for parents. By getting things right from the off we’re making sure our youngsters are ready to learn when they start school so that they get the most out of their education. Every child should have a fair crack at the whip from the start and be able to go on to fulfil their potential. New figures published today set out the number of two-year-old children eligible from 2013 in all 152 local authority areas, with a total of around 150,000 set to benefit. The figures will help local authorities prepare for the expansion of free places. It was also confirmed that money to fund free early education will be included within the ring-fenced Dedicated Schools Grant from April 2013, so that nurseries, pre-schools and childminders can be confident that, if they expand to offer these new places, the funding will be available. The additional amount invested on early education by the government will have risen by more than £1 billion a year. Later this morning (Wednesday 30 May), Deputy Prime Minister and Children’s Minister Sarah Teather will hold a summit with some of the country’s biggest childcare providers to discuss how best to deliver the extension for 2-year-olds. Sarah Teather, Children’s Minister, said: High quality early education is the key to making a difference early on in a child’s life. All the evidence shows how important it is for their development. The challenge now is to make sure the least advantaged 2-year-olds are able to access their early education entitlement. Too often, the most disadvantaged children don’t get what they are entitled to. It’s important we now work with councils, nurseries and childminders to target free early education at those who stand to benefit the most. I am determined that the Coalition government will do all it can to make sure the poorest 2-year-olds and their families can reap the benefits from our investment around the country. Notes to editors The announcements follow a consultation by the government on how early education is delivered . The 10 areas to trial the entitlement to free early education in part of their area from September this year. The areas are Blackpool, Cornwall, Greenwich, Kent, Lambeth, Lancashire, Newcastle, Northamptonshire, Peterborough and Rotherham. Currently, 95% of 3- and 4-year-olds access 15 hours of free early education every week - more than 800,000 children nationally. The government set out how it will now extend this entitlement to the 20% least advantaged 2-year-olds. This means around 150,000 children will benefit in phase 1 from September 2013. From September 2014 this will rise to around 260,000 2-year-olds. Revised figures are published estimating the number of 2-year-old children who are eligible for free early education from 2013 in all 152 local authority areas. [Contact:997]"

/government/speeches/nicky-morgan-speaks-at-early-intervention-foundation-conference,"Thank you for that kind introduction. It’s a genuine pleasure to be here at the opening of this year’s conference, and just such a remarkable privilege to speak to so many people working on behalf of children and their families around the country. Huge thanks must of course go to Graham [Allen MP ] for his unwavering support and commitment. I know I speak on behalf of the government in expressing deep gratitude for his research over the years. I also welcome the EIF ’s new report, ‘Spending on late intervention: how we can do better for less’, published today. I’m very much looking forward to reading it. You have a fascinating day of discussion and debate ahead of you. Fascinating, but also vital - because it is undoubtedly vital that we help and support people when they’re at their most vulnerable, whether that’s children, teenagers, or their parents. The thought that any young person might, through no fault of their own, be denied the right chances and opportunities to fulfil their potential should be enough to make anyone with an interest in education and children sit up and think: how can I help? how can I change things for the better? Early intervention as a priority and focus for the government That’s why early intervention has been a real priority for the government over recent years - and why it’s a personal priority and a passion for me, too. Within the Department for Education, our reforms around childcare and the early years will mean that thousands more families will have access to high-quality and affordable early education, and thousands more children from the most disadvantaged backgrounds get the chance they need to start school on an equal footing with their better-off peers. Because we know that a child that falls behind early on is less likely to catch up. That’s we are determined to ensure all children get those critical basics. I know that early intervention is often particularly important for the most disadvantaged members of our society. Our ground-breaking reforms to the social work system continue. Because early intervention isn’t just about supporting children at the very beginning of their life, but about acting quickly when a problem gets worse. In fact, I’m pleased to announce today that we will, with the Department for Health, be supporting a small number of early adopter teaching partnerships to test and refine new and innovative approaches to delivering high-quality training for social work students and qualified practitioners. All to increase expertise in the sector, and ensure that children get the help they need, when they need it. More widely, the government’s Troubled Families programme aims to turn around the lives of 120,000 families with a broad range of issues, breaking the cycle of disadvantage and avoiding the tragic waste of human potential caused by long-term financial, social, and health problems. And as a mark of the government’s commitment raising the profile of early intervention, the Chancellor committed £3 million as part of the Autumn Statement to support early intervention pilots over the coming year. We’ve also created a mental health taskforce. Joining together ministers from across government, including myself and Sam Gyimah on behalf of the Department for Education, the taskforce recognises the complexities of early intervention, and the need for a coherent and comprehensive approach to tackling problems. Prevention is always better than cure, and that’s why we have a moral mission to provide compassion and support as soon as problems emerge, and do all that we can to ensure that every single child in the country has an equal chance to succeed in life, no matter their background or family circumstances. Proaction, not reaction: mental health Intervening early, rather than just reacting when problems are already getting worse is, put simply, the best way to prevent the serious personal, societal, and financial costs that poor mental health can cause. Investing money into this area really is spending to save in the long run. Because at least 1 in 4 of the population experiences mental health problems at some point in their life. Over half of adults who suffer with mental health problems found that their problems started by age 14, and three-quarters by their mid-twenties. In other words, that’s millions of lives affected by problems that, if caught and addressed in childhood, could have been tackled. And those millions of lives are affected in so many different ways. Imagine trying to find happiness and fulfilment in life when it’s hard even to cope with the very basics. We know that mental health issues can affect someone’s physical health, their social life, their ability to hold down a job, and there are even links with offending and anti-social behaviour. These heart-breaking personal costs also come with a financial cost - and a cost to the whole of society, too. Children and young people’s mental health disorders alone come with an annual cost of £1.6 billion. Not to mention the suffering and anguish for families affected. As Education Secretary, I visit schools every week, and talk to headteachers, teachers, school support staff, and pupils about the issues affecting them, their friends, and their schools. I’m sad to say that mental health comes up heartbreakingly frequently. Just this week I met an inspirational young man, John, who has now turned his life around after suffering appalling bullying in school. He stopped caring about education, and he stopped caring about himself. No one gave him the support he needed. No one intervened early enough. Hearing John’s story made me angry, and it made me even more committed to ensuring that we do all we can to ensure young people get the support they need. That’s why it’s so important that we give the right amount of money and time to early intervention, so that we can: help the thousands of young people around the country suffering at any given time give them and their families the support they need as soon as they start to struggle with life and really importantly, make sure it’s the support that works best for them The need for mental health knowledge and skills in schools But of course, our longer-term aspirations for changes to children’s mental health services will only be fully effective if they’re made to a system in which all those who work with children and young people have the right knowledge of mental health, and make the right links to specialists, when needed. So, at the heart of early intervention is good knowledge. We know it’s often teachers that first spot when something is wrong, and that’s why we have published guidance for schools on behaviour and mental health, including further information on mental health difficulties and useful identification tools. We’ve also funded the PSHE Association to produce guidance on teaching mental health - due to be published next month - with example lesson plans to follow. And we will be publishing a strategy looking at counselling services based in schools. It aims to provide schools with practical evidence-based advice informed by experts on how to ensure counselling they offer is high quality and achieves good outcomes. Recognising the role of the voluntary and community sector At the same time, I want to recognise and applaud the voluntary and community sector organisations that already play a huge role in supporting schools and providing good counselling. They quite rightly take their cues from children and young people themselves, and they’re especially skilled at building trust and providing help in an inclusive and non-stigmatising way. Their support extends into the local community, too. That’s absolutely vital. When I ask my constituents in Loughborough about the mental health support services they need, they mention the importance of community services as well as services in a more formal setting. So to reward this valuable work and encourage it to grow and thrive, I’ve ensured that a major new theme of our national prospectus grants is, for the first time, mental health. We’re looking for VCS [voluntary and community sector] organisations that can make a real difference by helping professionals, and crucially, children, young people and their families themselves, to recognise mental health issues, do something about them quickly, and get access to the right treatment. I’m delighted that we’ve seen a great range of really innovative bids from real experts in the field. We’ll be announcing the results of the process in mid-March, with projects getting underway from April onwards. Speaking of innovation, our innovation programme continues to award money to projects around the country that are providing a fresh look at the support we give children, teenagers, and their families. This is a government investment of £100 million to help local groups deliver change. I am pleased to announce today that we have agreed funding for a further 6 successful projects, including some that get right to the heart of tackling some of the most challenging mental health problems experienced by young people in, or on the edge of care. And I would like to take this opportunity to highlight the fantastic work that 3 of these projects will soon be undertaking. Including exciting new work by the Priory Education Services, who are working with Suffolk council to pilot a new type of residential home, combining mental health treatment with a smaller and more personal setting, helping teenagers and their families through crisis periods, and avoiding the need for longer-term placements. And Action for Children, who are working with Barnet, Harrow, and Hounslow councils to run a new suite of evidence-based programmes, assisting local authorities and transforming the support available to teenagers in west London. Or even the National Implementation Service, which will build on a decade of experience to extend its support to over 70 councils across the country, helping young people to tackle problem behaviour and substance abuse, and stopping them from entering care. Between them, these projects are benefitting from £8.5 million of funding from the Department for Education. Not only will they impact on the lives of hundreds of teenagers directly, but the programme will help to rethink the way that services offer support across the country. Character and resilience It’s clear to me that mental health and character education are on opposite sides of the same coin. When I became Education Secretary, one of the first things I did was to add a fifth priority for the department - to prepare well-rounded young people, ready for adult life in modern Britain. That’s how much I value it. Children with the right confidence, skills, and resilience will find challenging situations and periods of emotional upheaval much easier to deal with. They’ll have the resilience to remain strong, and if and when problems become more serious, the confidence to ask for help when they need it. To reflect the importance of a well-rounded education, we’re giving schools and organisations that offer activities promoting character the chance to expand these programmes through a new £3.5 million fund. We are also giving £1 million to the Education Endowment Foundation to help build the evidence base in character education. Through our newly announced character awards, we will recognise excellence and diversity in character education, acknowledging that character is already being encouraged and developed alongside academic rigour through a variety of programmes within and outside schools across the country. The importance of collaboration I’ve spoken to you about what the government is doing, the money we’re providing, and the real importance of VCS organisations in helping the community. And as I have said, it should be clear that early intervention is not just a priority for the government - it’s a personal priority of my own. Just last week I met the leaders of 3 of the 5 children’s charities behind the ‘Stitch in time’ report, published last summer. Between them the NSPCC , Barnardo’s, The Children’s Society, Save the Children, and Action for Children, have produced a report that succeeds in articulating the principles of early education, and in offering a challenge to everyone working in children’s services. But if we want to effect long-lasting culture change in how we best help young people and families in crisis, we need to join up these different strands and work together. Not just in financial terms, but partnering up, sharing best practice: collaborating and innovating together. Gathering and sharing evidence about what works. Because proving what works and ensuring that it pays off is the best way to make the strongest case for early intervention. And making a reality of early intervention will also depend on a wider cultural change and about more joined-up thinking. I am committed to seeing this drive continue: so that teenagers like John get the support they need, as soon as they need it so that the most vulnerable and defenceless members of our society have the voices they need to speak up on their behalf, to demand more support, better services so that the children I see every week, all over the country, can thrive, happy and secure, because they’ve been given the right care when they need it Thank you for everything you do in helping this become a reality."

/government/speeches/unseen-children,"Good morning As Ofsted‟s Chief Inspector, I am determined to use the power and influence of inspection to improve our education system. With government, I am determined to challenge providers to do better so that our education system can genuinely become world class and compete with the most successful nations in the world. This is entirely within our capacity. I wouldn’t be doing this job unless I thought it was so. But, as a country, we have to tackle 2 major barriers to becoming world class. Firstly, the wide variety in regional performance highlighted in my first Annual Report. This found that in some parts of England parents had over a 90% chance of finding a good primary school whereas, in others, parents had less than a 50% chance. Secondly, the long tail of underperformance which mainly affects our poorest children. In this regard, we are amongst the worst performing of the OECD countries. The 2 issues are closely related because providers who fail their poorest children are more prevalent in some regions than in others. This is what our data shows us. That is why I have such high hopes of Ofsted’s regional structure and the work of our Regional Directors and HMI. They must shine a spotlight on local authorities and individual institutions that are failing their children. But system-wide improvement needs much more if we are going to reduce this historical underperformance. It requires co-ordinated action by national and local government, as well as by education professionals throughout the land. I also have an optimistic message as Chief Inspector. The rising tide of educational standards is, at last, beginning to lift the boats for our poorest children in some parts of our country. This third report in 20 years into the provision for our most disadvantaged children is not as bleak as the findings of Stewart Sutherland in 1993 and David Bell in 2003. This is a more optimistic report because we are beginning to learn the lessons of the good practice that we see in schools which are doing well for our poorest children. I am quite clear about the prime reason for this more optimistic picture. Where the political spotlight focuses attention on the needs of our poorest children, improvement does follow. That is why this report is entitled Unseen children . They emerge from the darkness of educational failure when we as a country show the resolve to do something about them. Poor, unseen children can be found in mediocre schools the length and breadth of our country. They are often found in leafy suburbs, market towns and seaside resorts. They can be found in comparatively prosperous communities, many of them achieving far less than they should. They are labelled, buried in lower sets, consigned as often as not to indifferent teaching. They coast through education until – at the earliest opportunity – they sever their ties with it. These children are not unseen in our best schools, which have good knowledge and high expectations of every child. But in more complacent schools such children do badly. So, let me be clear; disadvantage and poor achievement are not necessarily tied to urban deprivation and inner city blight. Indeed, since the last report 10 years ago, a considerable number of our poorest children are doing much better in such areas, particularly in London. Political focus, good organisation and professional leadership can make a difference to these historical problems. That is why I am making practical and affordable recommendations to government which I believe can make a lasting difference to closing the attainment gap. This report is the result of widespread deliberation by an Expert Panel of head teachers, academics and educational leaders. I am most grateful to each of them for their input but I take responsibility for the findings and recommendations of this review. Many other people and organisations have contributed to the review and I wish to thank them also. The evidence on which this speech is based contains much supporting data and analysis, as well as a number of academic papers on specific issues. The evidence is published separately today. I hope you will take the time to look at it carefully, because it paints a striking new picture of disadvantage and educational underachievement. Although we have looked again at the seven local authority areas examined originally in 1993, this review is more far-reaching than previous reviews and reports, for the following 4 reasons. Firstly, we show that poverty of expectation is a greater problem than material poverty because we know of examples of schools serving areas of great disadvantage that are doing very well by their children. It is true that many families find it hard to make ends meet. But the children of poor families with high aspirations do better at school than those whose parents and teachers expect little of them. Many children who live in spiritually and culturally barren circumstances with confused values and constant worries present a real challenge to our society. Some parents, having been failed by education themselves, place little value on it. This is the greatest blight, and it predominates within the underprivileged White British communities that are the lowest performing of all the major ethnic groups in England. Secondly, this review is far wider in scope. It is not simply focused on secondary education and urban disadvantage but considers less visible, underachieving children and young people the length and breadth of the country. We have viewed disadvantage in the context of those children entitled to free school meals. We have identified where they are, and how well they achieve. Many live in areas that might be considered generally affluent but nonetheless are performing poorly. Many others live in places that are relatively isolated, such as rural communities and coastal towns. We need new policies and approaches to deal with underachievement in these areas. Thirdly, we have considered pre-school education, schools, and vocational training to the age of 19. In what follows we often refer to the outcomes for children at the end of secondary school as a measure of success or failure. This is not because I think secondary education is the most important phase for young people. Far from it. If we could get the earlier years right for everyone, that would make much more of a difference. However, the outcomes at the end of secondary school reveal clearly the impact of what has gone before. They also account, to a large extent, for success in subsequent courses and qualifications and the prospects of a secure economic future thereafter. Finally, we have found growing evidence that good schools and other providers with the missionary zeal to do more, are making a powerful difference. They do much to compensate for family shortcomings. In particular, such schools ensure that no child remains unseen. They shine the spotlight on these children and bring them out of the shadows. The more this happens, the better they do. Some reach unforeseen heights. I shall return to this later, but let me start by saying a bit more about our first theme. Poverty of expectation bears harder on educational achievement than material poverty, hard though that can be. And these expectations start at home. Children from disadvantaged backgrounds very often have high ambitions, especially when they’re young. But the odds against achieving them can worsen with age. All too often there comes a point at which expectations shrink. They don’t see their elder siblings or friends going to university, so they think it’s not for them. Or no-one in their household is in paid work, so they don’t expect to get a job. But where the family is supportive and demanding then in my experience the child is much more likely to succeed. Success can be achieved in all communities. There have been striking changes to the pattern of achievement by the main ethnic groups in England over the last 5 years. For example, Black African children have now caught up with - and Bangladeshi children have surpassed - the performance of White British children by the end of secondary school. Let me give you another example. There is now almost no difference between the GCSE results of children who speak English as their mother tongue and those for whom English is an additional language. When we consider those children entitled to free school meals, it is the White British children who do worst out of all the main ethnic groups. The underperformance of low-income White British pupils matters, particularly because they make up the majority – two-thirds – of such pupils. So the lowest-performing group of poor children is also the largest. If we don’t crack the problem of low achievement by poor White British boys and girls, then we won’t solve the problem overall. Let me emphasise, this is not a gender issue. Poor, low-income White British girls do very badly. So we should stop talking about “white working class boys‟ as if they are the only challenge. It is sometimes said that “schools cannot do it alone‟, but this is not quite true. Exceptional schools can make up for grave disadvantages faced by young people. In the process they almost become surrogate parents. However, the job of schools is made so much easier, or so much harder, by the expectations that families have for their children. So as a society we have to create a culture of much higher expectations for young people, both in our homes and in our schools. Far too many children fail because they live in families and attend schools which have far too low expectations of them. Poverty of expectation is insidious because it limits achievement and thus damages children’s prospects. The most effective schools can and do make up the deficit. Our previous reports on outstanding schools in challenging circumstances absolutely demonstrate this. The very best of such schools and heads must be celebrated and incentivised to do more, and much more. I will return to this later. Let me now turn to the geographical inequities for poor children. Many children from poor families live in urban areas of social and economic disadvantage and go to schools serving concentrations of such pupils. However, many don’t live in this kind of place at all. Often they are spread thinly, as an “invisible minority‟ across areas that are relatively quite affluent. Where do you think is the worst place in England to be a child from a poor family, in terms of educational opportunity? Is it inner London, Liverpool, Leeds or Manchester? Absolutely not at all. The evidence suggests that it’s West Berkshire. Disadvantaged children in this lovely, affluent part of south east England last year had: the worst attainment in the whole country at primary school the second worst at secondary school and were in one of the bottom 3 local authorities for qualifications at 19 West Berkshire is an example of a much wider problem affecting the relatively prosperous counties of south-east England. On the surface, the overall outcomes for these areas may look good but, for children eligible for free school meals, they hide deep and shocking failure. So let me be absolutely clear this morning. My first recommendation is for Ofsted. We will be tougher in future with schools which are letting their poor children down. Schools previously judged outstanding, which are not doing well by their poorest children, will be reinspected. Other such unseen children are concentrated in small towns which are relatively isolated, including coastal towns. These places have rarely been the focus of the policy initiatives that have tended to operate in our big cities. The distribution of underachievement has shifted. Twenty or 30 years ago, the problems were in urban areas. Inner London schools were the best funded and worst achieving in the country. Now, schools in inner and outer London are the best performing, and performance in parts of Birmingham, Greater Manchester, Liverpool and Leicester has also been transformed dramatically. Let me show you what I mean. [Show the two maps of the strongest and weakest schools for FSM pupils in England] This map shows you secondary schools serving above average numbers of low income pupils, where they achieve very well. Look at the concentration in London. The next map also shows schools which are serving disadvantaged communities, but which are doing particularly badly for FSM pupils. And look at the different distribution. Many of the invisible children inhabit the classrooms and corridors of the legions of coasting – or sometimes sinking - schools that populate the provinces and hug the coasts of England. Disadvantaged children are usually in a small minority in these schools. They keep most of their parents happy with broadly acceptable results and purport to do their best for the rest. In the past, many of these coasting schools flew under Ofsted’s radar. They were not seriously challenged by the “satisfactory‟ or “good‟ judgements they routinely received when inspected. The underachieving children, populating the middle or lower sets of secondary schools, often remained invisible even to some inspectors, who were not sufficiently assiduous in seeking them out. Too many primary schools were satisfied with Level 4 at the end of key stage 2 without striving for Level 5 and now 6. So in many areas of the country, we have underachieving poor children… in unremarkable schools… with complacent leadership… where there is poverty of expectation… and lack of challenge by governors, parents or local authorities Why, has education in seaside towns like Blackpool and Hastings been so poor? (Although I am pleased to see positive signs recently in Hastings itself.) Why is education so dire in much of Norfolk? Why does East Anglia have so few National Leaders of Education? Why are schools in Herefordshire and Shropshire letting down their Free School Meals pupils? This is not good enough. I make no apologies for directing inspections towards schools that are anything less than good. They require improvement and we shall visit and revisit them until they do improve to good. These coasting schools are not just those in coastal isolation. They are equally to be found in Kettering and Wokingham, Norwich and Newbury, and in many other places that you’ve just seen on the map. The pattern of underachievement is particularly evident in a swathe of the country down the East and South-east of England. My Annual Report drew attention to this geographic preponderance of schools that were no better than satisfactory. When I visited East Anglia recently and was interviewed on local radio, the presenter wasn’t surprised that I was questioning standards in his part of the country. His view was that complacency and sluggishness had prevailed for years in this part of the world. “You’ll never change that here” he said. Well, let me tell you, Ofsted will not let the providers in these areas continue to fail their children. The eastern region includes local authority areas where national initiatives have left little trace. In these areas, National Leaders of Education and Teaching School Alliances have little foothold. In these areas, undue reliance is placed on school improvement services that lack impact and – increasingly – capacity. And yet, when I visited an outstanding primary school in East Anglia, I saw the reverse. I saw fantastic outcomes, brilliant teaching and inspired leadership. It can be done. There are such teachers, leaders and schools in all parts of the country – but in some areas, their power to have influence with schools more widely is stifled by complacency, mediocrity and timidity in school and local authority leadership. So what is to be done about these geographical areas or regions of underachievement? I very much favour the idea of sub-regional challenges, based on London Challenge, but adapted to the area or locality involved. London Challenge was not a bureaucracy. I know that because I worked in it. It worked because school leaders with the credibility to convey tough messages led it. It was a lean and mean organisation backed by big-hitting politicians. These key ingredients can be applied elsewhere with very little additional resource. Great leaders who run great schools have been showing for several years a wider moral commitment to help other schools improve. Why shouldn’t they now be regional players and take the lead in fixing schools across the country? My second recommendation is, therefore, the development and roll-out of subregional challenges aimed particularly at raising the achievement of disadvantaged children. I see sub-regional challenges as being absolutely key in driving forward and coordinating some of the other important changes that need to take place. The most important of these is to attract and incentivise the best people to the leadership of underperforming schools in these areas. Norfolk and Derbyshire, for example, have just a tiny handful of National Leaders of Education whilst other less needy local authorities are awash with them. Where is the strategy behind that? We need more National Leaders of Education working in the places that need them most. We need more National Leaders of Education with the experience and knowledge of working in the toughest and most complacent schools. And, above all, we need a strategy that matches the supply of great leaders with the demand for them. There is much for the National College [for Teaching and Leadership] to do here. Ofsted will make a commitment to work with the college and with government to recognise those who make the greatest contribution to system improvement. Those National Leaders of Education who are not prepared to take ownership of school improvement in areas of greatest need I believe should not be re-designated as such. My third recommendation, therefore, is that a more strategic approach is taken to the appointment of National Leaders of Education and their matching with schools in need of support. These sub-regional challenges can also help to ensure that good teachers are deployed in the areas of greatest need. This happens in countries where teachers are directly employed by the State. If, for example, the government contracted with a proportion of good teachers each year to do “National Teaching Service‟, they could be deployed in the schools which need them most. I know this goes against the grain of decentralisation and the free market but unless government is interventionist in this area, we are not going to get our most talented teachers to the schools in these areas. The government should work with Teaching Schools and others to identify and incentivise experienced and effective teachers who would be willing to work in these areas for a minimum period of time. To be a National Teacher could be seen as a badge of honour - a prestigious post with enhanced professional development and the likelihood of accelerated promotion. It would not be unreasonable to expect that those who really flourish should be fast tracked into leadership positions across the country. Again, the National College, together with its brigade of Teaching School Alliances, would have a key part to play in implementing this important proposal. My fourth recommendation, therefore, is that government does more to ensure that teachers on funded schemes are directed to underperforming schools in less fashionable or more remote or challenging places. The concept of a “National Service Teacher‟ should be an urgent consideration for government. I want to say something at this point about underachievement within and across the education, learning and skills sectors, beginning with Early Years provision for our poorest children. Underachievement starts from birth. Children who fall behind in the early years of their life struggle to catch up. If by 7, children cannot read, the odds are stacked against them. The good news is that this is much better understood now. Greater political focus and increased public funding have improved provision for the early years. The bad news is that many children still don’t get the support they need to make a secure start. This is particularly true of children from our poorest families. Effective nursery and primary schools set high expectations right from the very start. In these schools, children are introduced from the first day to structures and behaviours that help their learning. Clear routines bring order and security into their lives and help build self-assurance as well as awareness of the needs of others. These schools and nurseries also go out of their way to engage with parents who may themselves have had a bad experience of education. They make strong use of family support and social workers, and routinely make pre-school visits to the home to get to know the children. They also ensure that parents are engaged from the start in their children’s education. Most importantly, in the best nursery and primary schools there is a systematic, rigorous and consistent approach to assessment, right from the very start. When children arrive in the nursery or reception class, the best schools quickly assess each child in terms of key skills such as language and grasp of numbers. They use this baseline to inform teaching and support for each child. They link frequent assessments of each child’s progress to the professional development and performance management of their staff. Children in these schools make excellent progress, whatever their background. In such schools, only children with substantial learning difficulties or other barriers fail to achieve the benchmark level 4 in English and mathematics by the end of the primary stage. It is most important that we learn from this good practice and apply the lessons nationally. In particular, these schools interpret the requirements of the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) flexibly and intelligently, rather than following them slavishly. These schools assess their children much earlier than required by the EYFS Profile, much earlier. In my view, the current timing of national assessment, at the end of Reception year, is too late. Children may have lost a vital year of learning by then. In addition, these good schools focus their baseline assessments sharply on the key skills needed by young children to engage in learning. Their assessments emphasise a core of communication, language and literacy. The assessments are straightforward and carefully moderated to ensure accuracy. The schools use their assessments to track children’s progress right through to the end of key stage 1. The EYFS Profile, by comparison, is too broad an assessment and does not link effectively to subsequent key stage assessments. It provides a weak basis for accountability. Therefore, in my view, a major change is necessary in our approach to assessment in the early years. There should be a direct link between national assessment in Reception and assessment at the end of key stage 1 in order to measure progress. In addition, if the government does not want to reintroduce external testing in these early years then it must ensure that moderation is more consistently applied by local authorities or others. These changes would significantly improve schools’ accountability for their work up to the end of key stage 1. Therefore: My fifth recommendation is for government to review assessment in reception and key stage 1, with a view to publishing progress measures from the start of school to the end of key stage 1. I turn now to the other end of the age range that we have considered, and particularly vocational education. Let me make the assumption on the basis of what we know already, that a poor child has not made it successfully through pre-school, primary and secondary school. What chances has this child of making up ground in post-16 education and particularly in the college sector? Let me give you one shocking, awful fact. Of the roughly 7 out of 10 disadvantaged young people who leave school without the qualifications they need for employment, just 1 out of the 7 will gain them by the time they reach the age of 19. This attrition rate is a national disgrace. It leads to youth unemployment on its present scale and the stubbornly high levels of those not in education, employment or training. Vocational and skills-based training has not been good for many years because successive governments have not shone a bright enough spotlight on it. Once again, these young people have remained in the shadows. I was very critical of the FE and Skills sector in my Annual Report and questioned whether the “system was fit for purpose‟. We face an apparent paradox. Too few young people reach 19 with the qualifications they need for employment. Yet so called “success rates‟ in colleges have been remarkably high. This is palpable nonsense. It has arisen because providers have focused on the volume of qualifications and not on the real needs of individual learners and employers. This is an unacceptable situation. It has been reinforced by the perverse incentives of post-16 funding streams. Over half of businesses are not confident of being able to find sufficient recruits with the right skills in the future. Two in 5 employers seeking recruits with Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics skills find it hard or impossible to get them. For too long, the FE and Skills sector has been the Cinderella of the education world. This must change, quickly. I am encouraged by the government‟s response to my critical annual report last year. Rigour and Responsiveness set a new welcome tone of high expectations and rapid intervention to support all FE and Skills providers to be good. It also promised to take more rapid action where failure or inadequacy is identified. I welcome the establishment of a Further Education Commissioner. It will be an important position in an increasingly complex post-16 landscape. Many providers have opted for a broad generalist approach rather than focusing on specialist vocational provision. This might be appropriate in some areas but less so in others. In the case of poor quality and large generalist FE providers, radical measures are needed. My sixth recommendation, therefore, is that the government should be more prepared to dismantle inadequate colleges that have grown too large to assure quality across their different activities. Smaller specialist units, including University Technology Colleges, should be created with stronger links to business, commerce and industry. The level of employer engagement in the FE and skills sector must be strengthened greatly. More employers should be in schools, colleges and providers, advising on the curriculum and providing young people with the direct experience of work. Apprenticeships are the best way of developing young people’s vocational skills, giving them a greater chance of secure employment. The number of apprentices is increasing, but mainly for the over-25 range. The focus now needs to be on the younger age group – 16 to 19 year olds - who would benefit from a rigorous level 3 apprenticeship over at least a 2 or 3 year period. My seventh recommendation, therefore, is that the Richard Review should be fully implemented. It provides a sound basis on which to reform and grow this system. All learners will remain in full-time education beyond 16 from September 2013. It is essential while still at school that they have access to better, well-informed and, above all, independent advice about the full range of opportunities open to them post-16. We need to have clearer information to help us track the plight of our most disadvantaged – those invisible children - as they grow into young adults and leave school. The free school meal status is recognised in schools and serves to hold headteachers to account for their contribution to improving social mobility. If we believe the Pupil Premium is important pre-16 then surely we should consider making additional provision post-16 for our poorest students and tracking their progress from school through to employment. We should never lose sight of these young people. My eighth and final recommendation, therefore, is that all post-16 providers should report on the rate of progress and outcomes for all young people who had previously been eligible for free school meals. So let me recap my recommendations: My first recommendation is for Ofsted. We will be tougher in future with schools which are letting down their poor children. Schools previously judged outstanding, which are not doing well by their poorest children, will be reinspected. My second recommendation is the development and roll-out of sub-regional challenges aimed particularly at raising the achievement of disadvantaged children. My third recommendation is that a more strategic approach is taken to the appointment of National Leaders of Education and their matching with schools in need of support. My fourth recommendation is that government does more to ensure that teachers on funded schemes are directed to underperforming schools in less fashionable or more remote or challenging places. The concept of a “National Service Teacher‟ should be an urgent consideration for government. My fifth recommendation is for government to review assessment in reception and key stage 1, with a view to publishing progress measures from the start of school to the end of key stage 1. My sixth recommendation is that the government should be more prepared to dismantle inadequate colleges that have grown too large to assure quality across their different activities. Smaller specialist units, particularly University Technology Colleges, should be created with stronger links to business, commerce and industry. My seventh recommendation is that the Richard Review should be fully implemented. It provides a sound basis on which to reform and grow this system. My eighth and final recommendation is that all post-16 providers should report on the rate of progress and outcomes for all young people who had previously been eligible for free school meals. I also make a commitment as Chief Inspector that Ofsted will revisit this issue every 5 years and not every 10. By the next report in 2018, I hope I can say that most if not all of these recommendations have been implemented and that our poorest children have continued to improve their educational performance. Nevertheless, everything I have said to this point is predicated on the political will of government and the determination of professionals to move these unseen children from the back of the class to the front, from the darkness into the sunlight. There are stark consequences for our nation if we do not act with sufficient urgency and see it through. Extremists of every hue will feed upon the anger and despair of those not in employment and with poor prospects. We will continue to lose our place as a competitive nation and bear the costs of failure. In conclusion, the quality of education and training is, I believe, the most important issue facing Britain today. In the long term, our success as a nation – our prosperity, our security, our society – depends on how well we raise and educate our young people. And for individual children and young people, education can make a huge difference to their health, happiness and fulfilment. Fifty years ago, a key government committee led by John Newsom produced a report Half our Future which led to the raising of the school leaving age. He concluded: “The greater the number of people who prove to be educable beyond all previous expectations . . . the stronger the suspicion grows that the rest may have been underestimated also, and that we are somehow failing a substantial number of young people.” Our education system has undoubtedly got better over the past 50 years and certainly more than “half our future‟ is now well served. But our poorest children, roughly 20% of the nation’s children and young people, are still getting a raw deal. As Chief Inspector, I will only be happy if this report has the same impact as the Newsom report of half a century ago. Thank you."
/government/news/number-of-2-year-olds-eligible-for-free-childcare-to-double,"From next week, around 40% of 2-year-olds will be entitled to 15 free hours of free early education per week - up from 20% last year. Evidence suggests that children from less advantaged backgrounds often start school 19 months behind their peers, but also reveals that good quality childcare can reduce this gap and have a significant benefit in terms of a child’s development. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said: Giving a helping hand to families that need it most will mean thousands more children get a brighter start in life. This September, we’re doubling the number of free childcare places for 2-year-olds. All parents need to do to check if they qualify is contact their local authority or children’s centre. All the evidence shows that if you compare 2 5-year-olds hanging up their coats next to each other on the first day of school, the poorer child will already be behind their better off classmate before a single lesson has been taught. Without this help, children suffer and the whole class suffers as teachers have to focus more of their efforts on children who are frustrated and left behind through no fault of their own. I believe that every British family, whatever its structure, background and circumstances should be able to get on in life. Childcare and Education Minister Sam Gyimah said: It is wholly wrong that children from lower income backgrounds can be behind their peers even before they’ve attended their first primary school lesson. We know that good quality early education can make a huge difference in levelling the playing field and improving a child’s life chances. This free childcare entitlement gives children crucial support that could make all the difference to how well they do at school and beyond. I encourage parents who think their toddler may be eligible from this September to check this and make sure they don’t miss out. The extension of free childcare to 2-year-olds builds on the entitlement of 15 free hours a week already available to all 3- and 4-year-olds. In addition, the government meets up to 70% of childcare costs for low- and middle-income families through tax credits and are also introducing tax-free childcare from autumn 2015 which will see all eligible families receive up to £1,200 towards each child’s childcare costs. The government is also launching a campaign today to encourage parents in areas of low take-up to get in touch with their council and take up their free entitlement. Background Information about whether or not your child is eligible can be found at www.gov.uk/freechildcare . To be eligible parents must be getting one of the following: Income Support income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance (JSA) income-related Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) support through part 6 of the Immigration and Asylum Act the guaranteed element of State Pension Credit child Tax Credit (but not Working Tax Credit) and have an annual income not over £16,190 the Working Tax Credit 4-week run on (the payment you get when you stop qualifying for Working Tax Credit) Working Tax Credits and earn £16,190 a year or less Children are also entitled to a place if: they’re looked after by a local council they have a current statement of special education needs (SEN) or an education health and care plan they get Disability Living Allowance they’ve left care under a special guardianship order, child arrangements order or adoption order The campaign will primarily cover London, West Midlands, Yorkshire, East Midlands, Greater Manchester and Lancashire.

/government/news/childrens-minister-sarah-teather-comments-on-the-launch-of-the-cross-government-child-poverty-strategy,"Commenting on the launch of the cross-government child poverty strategy, Children’s Minister Sarah Teather said: Every child deserves a happy life free from poverty and free from fear. Children face too many difficulties in today’s Britain. In this strategy we re-commit ourselves to ending child poverty by 2020 and breaking the cycle of intergenerational disadvantage that has blighted children’s lives and aspirations for too long. We know that the early years of a child’s life are critical to their success in adulthood which is why we will measure progress on child development, infant health and school attainment. This is in addition to reforming Sure Start, early years education and our school system to focus resources on the most disadvantaged children and families. And we are adding an indicator of severe poverty alongside the income targets in the Child Poverty Act so can see whether we are properly targeting the most disadvantaged. Today’s publication of the child poverty strategy is an important milestone, but it is only the start. The government’s future strategies will say more about how every child can be given the support they need to succeed, and show how we can genuinely transform the lives of children and families. The child poverty strategy is available to download from the Department for Education’s website . [Contact:997]"
/government/news/nurseries-must-do-more-to-give-children-the-best-start-in-life,"Nurseries and other child carers must do more to help toddlers learn, Childcare and Education Minister Sam Gyimah has said, after statistics published today (16 October 2014) show too few young children are ready for school. The statistics show that overall 60% of children aged 5 are making good progress against the early years foundation stage profile ( EYFSP ). However, the gap between those from the most disadvantaged areas and their peers has remained static at 12%. The EYFSP is designed to ensure that all children are prepared and ready for school and life in modern Britain. It measures things like how children play together through to being able to count to 10 and write their own name. Childcare and Education Minister Sam Gyimah said: Ensuring parents have access to affordable, flexible and high-quality early years provision is a key part of our plan for education. We know the first few years of a child’s life can be make or break in terms of how well they go on to do at school and beyond. The statistics published today clearly show that some progress is being made but more must be done to ensure children, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds, are put on the right path. Parents need to be confident that while their children are out of their care they’re not only safe, happy and having fun but at the same time developing important skills like playing confidently with their friends, speaking, and understanding words, letters and numbers. The government has provided new funding through the early years pupil premium and strengthened qualifications to raise standards. It’s now up to those who support our children to ensure they get the start in life they deserve - something parents and I both want to see. The EYFSP statistics also show: 53% of children in the most deprived areas achieved a good level of development compared with 65% of their peers 66% of children achieved at least the expected level of development in literacy and 72% in mathematics girls continue to outperform boys with 69% of girls achieving a good level of development compared with 52% of boys - particularly in writing The government has introduced a number of initiatives to ensure that those who care for our children have extra support to help. These include: introducing the early years pupil premium - giving providers additional funding to provide specialist high-quality support for some of the most disadvantaged children ensuring all early years teachers must now meet rigorous new standards and pass the same skills tests as trainee school teachers changing the rules so that all early years educators who are responsible for leading nurseries and educating and caring for young children will be required to have at least a C in GCSE English and maths. From August 2015, they will have to achieve these minimum grades before they even start their course making up to £5 million of new funding available to encourage local areas to explore ways of improving their early years practice ahead of the introduction of the early years pupil premium in April 2015 The Effective Pre-School, Primary and Secondary ( EPPSE ) research published recently, highlighted the benefit of high-quality early education. It showed that children who go to pre-school are projected to earn £27,000 more during their career than those who don’t. They are also more likely to get better GCSE results - the equivalent of getting 7 Bs compared to 7 Cs. The research also found that early education helped young people to specifically do better in GCSE English and maths. The effects were better if the pre-school was of high quality, and pre-school is particularly valuable for children from less advantaged backgrounds. Chief Executive of the Professional Association for Childcare and Early Years ( PACEY ) Liz Bayram said: All children - especially our most disadvantaged young children - deserve high-quality, playful early learning, and PACEY welcomes the minister’s recognition that early learning happens whilst children are having fun. We also welcome his acknowledgment that helping young children to develop essential social and emotional skills such as talking, listening to and playing with others is as important as understanding letters and numbers. Childcare professionals share his goal that more needs to be done to close the attainment gap for disadvantaged children. Year on year, Ofsted grades demonstrate the sector’s capacity to continuously improve. We are looking forward to working with the Department for Education and other sector organisations to ensure all providers are supported to further improve. In particular, PACEY is keen to help set out how the 2-year-old offer and early years pupil premium can support settings to invest more in quality improvement so all their practitioners are supported to focus on helping children reach their full potential. Director of Early Years at Bright Horizons Family Solutions Nicola Amies said: Pleased today to hear the new minister’s call to see even more progress for children in the early years as we believe all children can benefit from high-quality care and early education. Many providers have a great deal of expertise and commitment in providing the very best experiences for babies and children, and there is much to be gained by the collective sharing of wise practice across the sector. All providers want the best for the children in their care. We understand the value of continuous quality improvement with strong, inspirational leadership that embeds a culture of critical reflection and ongoing professional development for staff, and that sets high expectations for children’s experiences and progress. Collaborative working across the sector can make a significant impact on the journey we are all on to give young children the best foundations for success in life. Background Read the early years foundation stage profile results (for academic year 2013 to 2014) statistics . The new EYFSP was introduced in September 2012 and is completed by teachers for all children in the summer term of their reception year at school. There is no test - assessment is based on teacher observations throughout the year. Teachers make a best-fit assessment of whether children are emerging, expected or exceeded against 17 early learning goals. Children are deemed to have a good level of development in the new profile if they achieve the expected level in the prime areas of personal, social and emotional development, physical development and communication and language, and the specific areas of and literacy and mathematics.

/government/speeches/michael-gove-speaks-about-the-importance-of-teaching,"Above my desk at home there’s a simple slogan - ‘If you can read this, thank a teacher’. And I do. Every day. I give thanks for the wonderful opportunities I’ve been given by a succession of great teachers - from Mr Gillanders to Mike Duncan, Mrs Christie to Cath Richmond. Every day I also give thanks for the amazing work being done by the teachers who are starting the new school year this week. I am fortunate as Education Secretary because we have the best generation of teachers ever in our classrooms - including the very best generation ever of young teachers - those who have entered our classrooms over the last few years. Whenever I can, I give thanks for their work - not just privately, but on any public platform I’m given. Including this one. This government is determined to do all it can to support the teaching profession. Because there can never have been a more important time to be a teacher. Teachers hold in their hands the success of our country and the wellbeing of its citizens; they are the key to helping every child in this country to realise their full potential. Teachers are the most important fighters in the battle to make opportunity more equal. Teachers are the critical guardians of the intellectual life of the nation. Teachers give children the tools by which they can become authors of their own life story and builders of a better world. It is teachers, not poets, who are the unacknowledged legislators of mankind. And it is because the teaching profession is so crucial that our programme of education reform has been designed to empower teachers; to give them more freedom, more power and more prestige. I know that - sometimes - the speed with which I want to improve our schools, and - occasionally - the style with which I have made my case, have led some to argue that I am - implicitly or explicitly - seeking to criticise teachers. But nothing could be further from the truth. I want to defend teachers - and teaching - from the critics and cynics. Because there are attacks directed at teaching - and I want to fight them. In too many ways and by too many people - the importance of teaching is being denied. There are 4 principal attacks on the work teachers do, which I want to anatomise today: The first attack holds that teaching is a depressing and demotivating activity - and that the profession is suffering reputational decline. The second attack is a denial that teaching can make any real difference. The third attack is the sidelining of the teacher from the activity of learning. And the fourth attack comes from those who believe teachers can’t be trusted - that they need outsiders at every turn to monitor, police and approve their activities. I want to deal with each of those attacks in turn. The first attack on teaching comes - perhaps surprisingly, perhaps unsurprisingly - from the leadership of the 2 biggest classroom unions. Chris Keates, the General Secretary of the NASUWT , has described teaching as a profession ‘in crisis’ - in which morale is at ‘rock bottom’, or ‘an all-time low’. She claims that teachers are ‘angry, frustrated and demoralised’; that three-quarters of teachers feel professionally disempowered, that recruitment into initial teacher training is plummeting, and she has cited what she has claimed is research showing that over half of respondents have considered leaving the teaching profession. Why is morale so low? Well, according to Chris Keates’s closest colleague, it’s because this government’s education reforms are a breach of international humanitarian law. According to Dr Patrick Roach, the Deputy General Secretary of the NASUWT , this government’s Education Act was ‘a crime against humanity.’ It was ‘a smash and grab raid that will tear apart our schools and our communities’. Dr Roach is not, however, alone in suggesting that government reforms constitute cruel and unusual punishments inflicted on suffering innocents. Martin Powell-Davies of the National Union of Teachers National Executive has claimed that our education reform plans will make teaching ‘a totally unbearable profession’. It has come to something when the General-Secretary of the NUT ranks almost as a voice of moderation. But even though Christine Blower doesn’t indulge in the hyperbole of others she still presents teaching as a profession in the grip of some terrible malaise. She has argued that ‘it is hardly surprising that some teachers are voting with their feet and leaving the profession. A combination of pension cuts, pay freezes, an ever-increasing workload and continual inspection and criticism from government at every turn will make retention of teachers increasingly difficult’. And she has argued that ‘those who remain’ face ‘plummeting morale’. The picture these union leaders paint is of a profession which no one rational would wish to join - a profession which is unattractive, unrewarding and unfulfilling. The truth, however, is very different. Teaching - as a profession - has never been more attractive, more popular or more rewarding. Take the figures cited by the NASUWT about teacher opinion - they come from a self-selecting sample of their members, unrepresentative of the profession as a whole. And despite their survey’s annual claims, it’s clearly not the case that more than half of NASUWT ’s members are actually leaving the profession every year - in fact, year after year, more people in England join the teaching profession than leave it. Indeed, teaching has a far better retention rate than many other careers for highly-qualified people. Overall, teachers are only half as likely to leave their chosen profession as graduates in popular non-teaching roles (44% of graduates in non-teaching roles switched career within their first 3.5 years, compared to just 21% of teachers). The numbers who would recommend the profession are up. Ninety-eight per cent of school leaders surveyed by the National College for Teaching and Leadership this year say that overall ‘it’s a great job’; and 91% say they would ‘recommend their job to other staff’. The numbers who think that the profession is rewarding are up. The Teaching Agency’s annual survey of final year undergraduates at leading universities found that 86% thought that teaching is a rewarding career; 66% think teaching involves ‘demanding work that has real status and kudos’; 61% think teaching is a ‘great career option for the long term’. When asked to choose an adjective that best described a teaching career, the largest number of respondents said ‘rewarding’. Last year’s survey found that 71% of undergraduates thought the image of teaching was improving, while 72% thought their friends and family would react positively to them becoming a teacher - up 6% since 2010. The numbers of highly-qualified people entering teaching are up. More than 7 out of 10 new teachers now have a first or upper-second class degree, the highest proportion ever recorded and an increase of 9 percentage points since 2010 to 2011. Teach First has moved up to third place in the rankings of the Times ‘Top 100 Employers 2013’, its highest ever position; first place in High Fliers research of 100 major graduate recruiters. According to the OECD , teachers in England are comparatively well-paid - with annual salaries in England higher than the OECD average, and higher than those in progressive Scandinavian nations such as Finland, Norway or Sweden. Teachers in England already progress up the pay scales twice as quickly as the OECD average, and our reforms to pay progression will mean that, from this year, the best teachers will have the opportunity to access greater rewards even earlier in their careers. And school leaders are now free to reward their best teachers more than ever before - with more autonomy to attract, retain and reward those teachers who have the greatest impact on their pupils’ performance. And research from March this year found that 69% of career changers thought that teaching was a career for them to consider, a rise of 5% in just 4 months; 71% of students felt that teaching was a career for them to consider, a rise of 10% in just 4 months. I think that growing enthusiasm for teaching reflects the fact that opportunities for teachers are now greater than ever. As national, local, and specialist leaders of education, leaders of academy chains and teaching schools … There are opportunities to change lives as subject leaders, like Simon Mazumder at Altrincham Girls Grammar – Head of Maths, a specialist leader of education, who is currently doing brilliant work on primary maths in collaboration with Manchester University. And there are opportunities to become educational pioneers by opening free schools, which can reshape how we teach and how students learn. Educational innovation has a new generation of heroes and heroines in Peter Hyman and Oli de Botton at School 21, in the team behind the Greenwich Free School, or in the inspirational classroom practitioner Mark Lehain who has opened an academically ambitious new school in one of the most disadvantaged parts of Bedford. There are also new opportunities to shape the whole educational debate. In the past, the education debate has been dominated by education academics - which is why so much of the research and evidence on how children actually learn has been so poor. Now, thankfully, teachers are taking control of their profession’s intellectual life, taking the lead in pioneering educational research and creating a living evidence base. Later this week the brilliant Tom Bennett - teacher, blogger, behaviour guru and free thinker - is bringing together other teachers at the ResearchED 2013 conference to debate how to use the most rigorous evidence to improve teaching itself. Some of the most impressive names in the profession - such as Tom Sherrington, Joe Kirby and Daisy Christodoulou will be speaking. Their initiative follows on from the groundbreaking work we commissioned from Dr Ben Goldacre - the author of ‘Bad Science’ - to help us understand how better use of evidence could improve teaching practice. His paper on ‘Building Evidence Into Education’ generated a vast amount of enthusiastic debate and discussion among teachers when it was published in March this year, both on and offline. And his paper sits alongside fascinating research carried out by teaching schools, exciting schemes like the National College for Teaching and Leadership’s Test and Learn programme, and the projects run by the Education Endowment Foundation, a new charity working to ensure that children from all backgrounds can make the most of their talents. I am particularly encouraged by the work being done by teachers to shape new curricula, using the freedoms enjoyed by academies. Caroline Nash, the inspirational sponsor of Pimlico Academy, has set up a wonderful new organisation - the Curriculum Centre - to help teachers develop challenging and aspirational knowledge-rich programmes of study. In Ark’s academies new and more ambitious maths curricula have been developed by brilliant young teachers. And David Benson, the newly-appointed principal designate of the Kensington Aldridge Academy, is also developing aspirational new approaches to the curriculum for students from disadvantaged communities. As well as leading the education debate, teachers are also our most valued public service workers. More and more teachers are being publicly recognised by this government for their inspirational leadership. More classroom teachers than ever before are being honoured for their work - in the 2013 honours alone, Ann Hambly of Queen Elizabeth’s Grammar School, Ashbourne; Paul Hughes of Queensbury Upper School, Bedfordshire; Peter Latham, a former PE teacher from Otley, West Yorkshire; Maggie Morgan from St Paul’s Nursery and Primary School, Brighton and Hove; Linda Wainwright from Slade Green Infants School. In fact, around 10% of all 2013 honours were awarded to people from the world of education. So - far from the picture drawn in such unremittingly bleak colours by the teaching unions, the reality of teaching in England today is that there’s never been a better time to be a teacher. In fact, I could not put it any better than Gerard Kelly, the outgoing editor of the bible of teaching, the Times Educational Supplement - who wrote in his valedictory editorial that: Contrary to most reports, teaching in Britain has never been in better health…The quality of recruits is phenomenally high, the pay isn’t bad, the profession’s status is rising, schools have never been better equipped and teachers’ pensions remain generous compared with most. Students have never been more motivated and parents rarely so supportive. Most encouraging of all are the widespread acceptance that a ‘satisfactory’ education isn’t really good enough and the determination of schools and teachers to take ownership of their profession, sharing ideas and best practice in ways unknown only a few years ago… The fact is that teaching, for all its bureaucratic indignities, petty frustrations and ceaseless initiatives, is a more respected profession and a more attractive graduate destination than it has been for many years. The stresses are endlessly cited, less so the equally stratospheric satisfaction levels. It really is the ‘noblest of professions’. The second attack on teaching has also - perhaps surprisingly, perhaps unsurprisingly - come from within the teaching unions. But it’s very far from restricted to them. The essence of this attack is a belief that teaching cannot actually make that much of a difference to the life chances of children. The people who make this argument exist on both Left and Right. From the Left - and from the perspective of a teaching union general secretary - Dr Mary Bousted makes the argument more eloquently than anyone. I say this in a spirit of genuinely respectful disagreement because I believe Dr Bousted is one of the most impressive people in the education debate. Mary has argued that the socio-economic circumstances of children determine their fate far more than the level of academic expectations at school or the quality of teaching. She maintains that the most important factor in educational success abroad is not great teaching, high expectations of students or the valuing of knowledge but ‘less wealth inequality’ and ‘far more balanced school intakes’. In essence - for Mary - it is overwhelmingly the case that deprivation is destiny. From the Right - and from the perspective of a distinguished academic - a parallel case is made by Professor Charles Murray. Again, I have enormous respect for Charles Murray and his work - but on this occasion, I disagree with him. He and others like him have argued that, because children inherit different cognitive abilities, the quality of teaching cannot significantly alter that and therefore large numbers of children are not equipped to succeed academically. In essence - for Charles - it is overwhelmingly the case that genetics are destiny. But if a child’s background and genetic makeup were all that mattered, then we would expect the same sorts of pupils in the same sorts of schools to get the same sorts of results. Whereas even the most cursory glance at schools in England and America reveals huge variations in performance, even in those schools with the most similar pupil populations. There are schools with relatively gifted - or wealthy - intakes which perform poorly, coasting along without generating real progress. And there are - thankfully - many state schools where children from poor backgrounds, who may have been dismissed as unacademic, perform brilliantly. Indeed there are some schools where the children - irrespective of background - all perform well. Schools like the Ark academies in England – like ULT ’s Paddington Academy and Thomas Jones Primary in West London. In all of these schools children from the poorest, most deprived backgrounds achieve just the same (impressively high) marks as their richer, luckier peers. And in other schools children who have been labelled as likely to perform at below the average academic level defy that categorisation. In schools like Cuckoo Hall Primary or Durand Academy far more children than the national average are registered as having special educational needs. But the vast majority of children - regardless of the challenges they face - achieved at or above the expected level in numeracy and literacy. Why do these schools succeed, transforming poor children’s lives and life chances, for good? Why do their children manage to achieve far over the odds, giving the lie to those pessimists and fatalists from Left and Right and defeating both the poverty of their backgrounds and their so-called innate ‘genetic limitations’? Because they share a single common denominator - a single-minded focus on teaching. On recruiting the best candidates, giving them the best training and development; maximising the time children spend being instructed by passionate experts in the disciplines of rigorous thought. An overwhelming body of academic literature shows that teacher quality and pupil performance are inextricably linked. McKinsey’s report, ‘How the world’s best-performing school systems come out on top’, showed that quality of teaching is the most important driver of quality in any education system - more important than any other factor. Studies in Tennessee have shown that an individual pupil taught for 3 consecutive years can make as much as 2 years more progress when taught by a top-performing teacher than by a poorly-performing teacher - teachers working in the same building, teaching pupils in the same grade, from the same backgrounds. Analysis in England has identified a quantifiable, measurable improvement in pupils’ exam grades when taught by a high-quality teacher. Other studies have shown that the benefits of high-quality teaching last a lifetime - with pupils taught by top-performing teachers ‘more likely to attend college, earn higher salaries, live in better neighbourhoods, and save more for retirement’. All over the world, in individual schools and wide-ranging academic literature, the evidence is crystal clear. Great teaching can and does make a huge difference to children’s performance. Great teaching involves empathy and energy, authority and resilience; detailed planning; constant self-improvement. A great teacher has the ability to ‘read’ a classroom and understand its dynamics, instantly; shows inspirational leadership, exciting and motivating pupils to help them achieve their full potential. But common to all the great teachers I know is a love of children and a love of knowledge. And that shouldn’t be surprising - because the very best academic research also proves the vital importance of an education which is knowledge rich. This concept is, however, undermined by the third attack on teaching, an old one - as old as Rousseau, in fact. It’s the belief that education should not be an activity in which the teacher imparts knowledge to the child but a pursuit - by the child - of what it finds interesting. In Émile, Rousseau wrote: ‘Let [a child] know nothing because you have told him, but because he has learnt it for himself. If ever you substitute authority for reason he will cease to reason, he will be a mere plaything of other people’s thoughts’. Various so-called progressive thinkers subsequently took up the same position. As David Green of Civitas has pointed out, these included influential writers like Ivan Illich, whose book ‘Deschooling Society’ (1971) complained that ‘real learning is not the result of instruction … most learning requires no teacher’; to Carl Rogers, author of ‘Freedom to Learn’ (1969), who claimed that teaching was “based upon a distrust of the student. The attitude of teachers was: ‘Don’t trust him to follow his own leads; guide him; tell him what to do; tell him what he should think; tell him what he should learn”. These arguments have been particularly pernicious in crucial areas like the teaching of reading, for example - where research has consistently and comprehensively shown, both in this country and around the world, that systematic, phonic instruction by a teacher is the most effective and successful way of teaching children to read. Ideologues, however, have long argued against phonics and direct instruction, claiming instead that children should be allowed to discover letters and words for themselves. This mindset - which holds that direct instruction (what you and I would call teaching) is harmful to children’s creativity and curiosity - is not new. From the Hadow report of 1933, which stated that ‘the child should begin to learn the 3 Rs when he wants to do so’; to the Plowden report of 1967, which declared that the ‘skills of reading and writing…can best be taught when the need for them is evident to children’ and the Bullock report of 1975, stating that ‘we do not suggest that children of any age should be subjected to a rigorous and systematic training programme’…the educational establishment has conspired against teachers. Again and again, in this country and abroad, educational thinkers who call themselves progressive, but who are anything but, have converged on the belief that the importance of teaching should be downgraded. These theorists have consistently argued for ways of organising classrooms and classroom activity which reduce the teacher’s central role in education. All too often, we’ve seen an over-emphasis on group work - in practice, children chatting to each other - in the belief that is a more productive way to acquire knowledge than attending to an expert. Although, as the great Texan President Lyndon B Johnson said, ‘you aren’t learning anything when you’re talking.’ Some schools have been pressured to fit in with prevailing doctrines, even against their own instincts. Some nurseries and schools in Kent, for example, reported to us that they were told to remove tables and chairs from their classrooms; were told that they were not allowed to keep children sitting still for longer than 1 minute for every year of their lives - not even during registration, or when listening to a story; were told that children were not allowed to tidy up, or be asked to put their coats on, in case it interrupted ‘child-initiated play’. And it’s not just group work - almost any activity which is not direct instruction has been lauded by the so-called progressives while direct instruction has been held up to criticism and ridicule. In her fantastic book ‘Seven Myths About Education’, Daisy Christodoulou recalls her own teacher training - when she was told that she talked too much in lesson practice - and in a bizarre inversion of LBJ’s wisdom she was told that when she was talking, the pupils weren’t learning. So what happens in classrooms when teaching is marginalised? The teacher Matthew Hunter records on his blog a series of lessons aimed at history students between the ages of 11 to 16 that he had encountered. They included studying the battle of Hastings by re-enacting it on a field with softballs, spending 3 lessons making castles out of cardboard boxes, making plasticine models to represent Hitler’s main aims as Fuhrer and recreating life on a slave ship by making pupils gather under their desks. Another teacher records a lesson for A level English students in which they were asked to depict literary characters on a paper plate - drawing a face on the plate - and then asked to use stickers to define the character’s principal traits - pinning the stickers on their clothes and mingling with other students, while they introduce themselves ‘in character’. Allied to these teaching methods which have nothing to do with passing on knowledge, there has also been an emphasis on teachers having to put their own learning aside so that work is ‘relevant’ to the students. This has resulted in the dumbing of educational material down to the level of the child - with GCSE English papers that ask students about Tinie Tempah, or Simon Cowell - rather than encouraging the child to thirst after the knowledge of the teacher. I believe that we need to move away from these approaches to education - I would call them pedagogies but they don’t leave much place for the pedagogue - towards an education system which believes, right from the early years, in the importance of teaching. Because schools are - above all - academic institutions. We need teachers to actively pass on knowledge, organised in academic disciplines such as physics and history - to introduce children to precisely those areas of human thought and achievement which they are most unlikely to discover or understand on their own. Children naturally learn to talk; they do not naturally learn to read, or to play the violin, or to carry out long division. The most impressive scientific evidence on how children learn - from experts like Paul Kirschner, Richard E Clark and John Sweller - all points towards the importance of direct instruction. Their work on ‘why minimally guided teaching techniques do not work’ is hugely powerful. Their thinking is reinforced by contemporary advocacy from the very best teachers at the sharp end - like Daisy Christodoulou. In ‘Seven Myths about Education’, again, she points out that learning depends on teachers passing on key ‘building blocks’ of knowledge to students so that they become lodged firmly in the memory. Using an instant recall of times tables, for example, to tackle long multiplication. Although the work may initially be hard, it brings its own special rewards. Only after building fluency in scales can musicians play a great sonata or concerto; only after learning how letters on the page correspond to sounds and words can children discover the magic and mystery of English literature. Daniel Willingham’s research in cognitive science has provided compelling evidence that a traditional knowledge-rich curriculum is the key to educational success. As he has written, ‘knowledge does much more than just help students hone their thinking skills: it actually makes learning easier. Knowledge is not only cumulative, it grows exponentially. Those with a rich base of factual knowledge find it easier to learn more - the rich get richer. In addition, factual knowledge enhances cognitive processes like problem solving and reasoning. The richer the knowledge base, the more smoothly and effectively these cognitive processes - the very ones that teachers target - operate. So, the more knowledge students accumulate, the smarter they become.’ Willingham’s comment that ‘the rich get richer’ is, sadly, not just a metaphor. All too often, children from more affluent backgrounds effortlessly acquire this broad knowledge base at home, equipping them with the tools needed at school and beyond; those from less privileged backgrounds miss out. The educationalist E D Hirsch has proved this phenomenon beyond any doubt - with research demonstrating that students with a higher level of ‘background’ knowledge were able to understand and analyse complex texts much better than their peers without that knowledge, who tended to come from poorer, less privileged backgrounds. As he wrote: African-American students at a … community college could read just as well as university…students when the topic was roommates or car traffic, but they could not read passages about Lee’s surrender to Grant [a pivotal battle in the American Civil War]. They had not been taught the various things they needed to know in order to understand ordinary texts addressed to a general audience. This, then, is the perverse result of so-called ‘progressive’ denigration of knowledge. Gramsci put it best: ‘the most paradoxical aspect of it all is that this new type of [education] is advocated as being democratic, while in fact it is destined not merely to perpetuate social differences, but crystallize them in Chinese complexity.’ In short, for too long - whether driven by a romantic, Rousseau-ian reluctance to crush a child’s delicate spirit, or a glib, Google-era insistence that knowledge is irrelevant in a world where ‘you can just look it up’ - the role of the teacher has been eroded. Which is why it is so encouraging that a growing number of teachers - indeed the most popular teachers on the web, like Andrew Old, whose blog has received more than 600,000 hits; Tom Bennett, with almost eight and a half thousand followers on Twitter, and Joe Kirby, with almost 2,000 - are arguing for a restoration of knowledge and direct instruction; in short, standing up for the importance of teaching. The fourth attack on teaching is one in which governments - including Conservative governments - have at times been complicit. It’s the belief that teachers need others to validate the work they do - whether those others are university academics, or inspectors, or examiners - who have never been teachers. Take, for example, the whole practice of teacher training. The evidence shows the best teacher training is led by teachers; that the skills which define great teaching - managing behaviour, constructing compelling narratives, asking the right questions, setting appropriate tasks - are best learnt from great teachers; that the classroom is the best place for teachers to learn as well as to teach. The work of Doug Lemov in the United States - teacher, founder of a charter school, author of ‘Teach Like a Champion’, which has transformed the debate around teacher training and won followers all over the world - has found support right across the American political spectrum. In this country, schools play a central role in all of the ITT providers judged to be outstanding under Ofsted ’s tough new regime. We have already taken a number of steps to put teachers and schools in charge of recruitment and training. Brand new teaching schools have become centres of excellence in training and development - and we will be expanding the number of teaching school alliances beyond the planned 500. The first group of teaching schools have now been operating for 3 years and I can now confirm that their funding will continue beyond the planned 4 years into a fifth year. While our new teacher training scheme, School Direct, gives aspiring teachers the opportunity to work in a great school from day one, just like student medics in hospitals - learning from more experienced colleagues and immediately putting their new skills into practice. We’ve also done a lot to deal with the systematic shortages of specialist maths and physics teachers that we inherited. We’ve collaborated with the Institute of Physics and the Institute of Mathematics to introduce prestigious new scholarships worth £20,000 and brought in new training bursaries of up to £20,000 to attract the brightest graduates into these core subjects, more if trainees go to schools with a high proportion of pupils on FSM . But we’ve got to go even further. So we will soon be announcing even greater incentives in shortage subjects, where recruitment has historically been most difficult, and we will do even more to encourage would-be teachers to study maths and physics at A level and beyond. And we’ve ensured that - at least in maths and physics - there will no longer be any cap on the number of teachers recruited each year, no published target for ITT places; on the contrary, we want to recruit as many new teachers in these subjects as we can. Schools can now also use their new powers to attract and reward great teachers in specialist subjects, in particular - giving them the power to pay great physics and maths teachers more, right from day one. As schools take more control over training the next generation of teachers, many of the best academy chains and teaching school alliances are now playing an even greater role in training the next generation of teachers as accredited SCITTs , school-centred initial teacher training providers. We want to see their numbers increase, enabling more aspiring teachers than ever before to benefit from the expertise and experience of some of the best in the business - so we will be bringing forward proposals to support this later in the year. The best higher education institutions welcome our changes because they know that discriminating schools will increasingly choose partners in HE who deliver the best quality training and development. Many have in fact been working hand in glove with schools for many years, and School Direct is just an extension of what they already do. Oxford University, for example, has collaborated with local secondary schools on an internship programme called Oxford City Learning for many years now, and School Direct places have simply been incorporated within that successful scheme. But sadly, there are some vested interests within some universities that oppose the shift towards school-centred teacher training by SCITTs or through School Direct; those, perhaps, which have long relied on an effective monopoly of teacher training to sustain their finances. So it’s vital for the future of the profession that we defend teachers from self-interested attacks - and stand up for the principle of teachers teaching teachers. We also need to defend teaching from the wrong sort of inspection. I am a passionate believer in the power of good inspection to improve education. And to those who question whether schools need to be inspected by any outside body at all - suggesting, perhaps, that schools should be the only state-funded institutions not accountable to any form of external authority - I merely point out that without Ofsted , exam results would be the only arbiter of a school’s performance - making a system more pressurised, more crude and more ‘high stakes’ than the one we have now. Inspection can be a catalyst for rapid and effective school improvement. We know that schools judged inadequate by Ofsted have generally made more rapid and sustained improvement than those marked ‘satisfactory’, the next rung up - which have tended to coast along at the same level. This, incidentally, is part of the reason why Sir Michael Wilshaw has, quite rightly, changed the old grade of ‘satisfactory’ into ‘requires improvement’ - sending the message that every school should, at least, reach ‘good’, and should be aiming even higher. Ofsted also provides an essential service in highlighting brilliant practice, the schools which make a difference and the teachers we should celebrate. And it has now changed the way it reports its findings so that every inspection report for an outstanding school clearly states on the very first page why that school is outstanding - making it much easier to understand why the best schools are doing so well. But there have been occasions - in the past - when inspection has not achieved what it should. Too few inspectors had recent - or current - experience of teaching. The framework, prior to 2010, required schools to be judged against more than 27 different criteria - putting ‘quality of teaching’ on a par with ‘whether pupils adopted healthy lifestyles’ and ‘the extent to which pupils contribute to the school and wider community’. And Ofsted ’s guidance provided too little clarity about what constituted good teaching; or allowed inspectors’ personal prejudices and preferences to be interpreted as ‘the Ofsted way’. As a result, and as teacher bloggers like Andrew Old have chronicled, time and again too much emphasis was given to particular practices like group work and discovery learning; while Ofsted inspectors marked teachers down for such heinous crimes as ‘talking too much’, ‘telling pupils things’ or ‘dominating the discussion’. The good news is that Ofsted - under its inspirational new leadership - is moving to address all these weaknesses and give us a system of inspection of which we can be proud. The numbers of inspectors with the right experience and credentials is rising. In 2010 to 2011, just 15% of inspections included a serving headteacher or senior leader - today, it’s 52% - and 88 national leaders of education have already trained as inspectors, with 45 more training this term and applications already oversubscribed for the next round. Outdated, misleading guidance has been replaced with a clear directive to reward great teaching - whether it matches the inspector’s personal preferences or not. And the Ofsted framework has been transformed so that, rather than peripherals, teaching now matters above all - in particular, the sort of teaching which generates excellence. That means less focus on processes, pedagogies, lesson plans and structures, and more focus on how well pupils learn. And a school cannot now be awarded an overall ‘outstanding’ grade unless its teaching is judged to be ‘outstanding’. It is thanks to Sir Michael Wilshaw - himself a great teacher - that these changes have been made - and they all point in one direction - the affirmation of the importance of teaching. That phrase - the ‘Importance of teaching’ - was the title of this government’s first and only education white paper; our most important priority then, and our most important priority now. It is the silver thread running through every single one of our policies, every part of our reform agenda. It’s because we know teaching can make such a difference that we have instituted policies that help teachers make that difference. Clearing away the distractions and slashing the unnecessary bureaucracy and central prescription which sapped so much of teachers’ time and energy; in numbers alone, we’ve removed or simplified over 50 unnecessary duties and regulations; and cut the volume of guidance issued to schools by 75%, over 21,000 pages. And giving teachers as much freedom, autonomy and independence as possible, to get on with they do best - teach. Every teacher in the classroom knows - as Gerard Kelly so rightly said - that teaching is the noblest of professions. Which is why everything the Department for Education does, has done and will do is designed to reinforce the importance of teaching."
/government/news/schools-given-5-million-to-work-with-local-nurseries,"Young children across the country are set to benefit from the best possible start in life thanks to a brand-new initiative backed by £5 million of government funding to boost the quality of early years education. The funding announced today (29 January 2015) will be awarded to more than 60 teaching schools across the country who will partner up with local nurseries to drive up standards and share best practice. All partners will be able to learn from each other in order to provide better early education and care for children and families, and support effective transitions from nursery into primary school. Evidence shows that the early years count. Children from less advantaged backgrounds can start school 19 months behind their peers, but good-quality early years education can reduce this gap and have a significant benefit in terms of a child’s development. Children who benefit from good-quality early years can go on to earn around £27,000 more during their career compared to those who don’t, and are also likely to do better at school - the equivalent of 7 GCSE grades at grade ‘B’ compared to grade ‘C’. Minister for Childcare Sam Gyimah today visited St Pauls Nursery School in Bristol, which will benefit from £60,000 funding to develop programmes with local nurseries to help meet the needs of children in the area. Sam Gyimah, Minister for Childcare, said: I was delighted to visit St Pauls Nursery School to learn more about how Bristol’s children are set to benefit from this innovative scheme, which will help ensure they receive the very best early years education. We know the first few years of a child’s life can be make or break in terms of how well they go on to do at school and beyond - and the sharing of expertise and best practice is vital to driving innovation and raising standards. This is a fantastic example of local schools, nurseries and private providers pulling together to improve the fantastic services on offer to families, helping their children to thrive. The new scheme will enable local nurseries to work with the very best early years teachers and school leaders to increase the quality of early years education in their area. The government recognises that systems based on the sharing of expertise are the best way to drive up standards in the sector. Today’s announcement is just the latest step in the government’s drive to make sure all children - no matter what their starting point in life - receive the best possible start in life and are ready to begin school, especially those from low-income families. Since 2010, the government has also: expanded 15 hours of free early education to 40% of 2-year-olds improved the quality of staff entering the early years workforce by introducing early years teachers reducing regulation to make it easier for new providers to open and existing ones to expand through the Small Business, Employment and Enterprise Bill This is the first group of successful schools to be announced.

/government/publications/practitioners-experiences-of-the-early-years-foundation-stage,"The main aim of this study was to elicit practitioners’ views and understand their experiences in using the early years foundation stage (EYFS) to inform a planned review of the framework to take place in 2010. The three main research questions were: how does the EYFS influence day-to-day practice with children and families how, if at all, has it supported improvements in the care and education offered by practitioners what obstacles and difficulties do practitioners face in the effective use of the EYFS The EYFS is a framework for all registered providers of services for children under 5, which became statutory in September 2008. It marks the first time that practitioners from all sectors of the early childhood workforce, from the head teachers of primary schools to registered childminders and after-school play-workers, have been required to observe the same guidelines relating to the education and care of young children. The framework provides statutory guidance, not only on the ways in which development and learning are to be supported within schools and settings, but on the ways in which relationships with families are to be established in support of these goals."
/government/news/nicky-morgan-and-david-walliams-launch-literacy-drive,"Education Secretary Nicky Morgan and children’s author and comedian David Walliams today issued a rallying cry to leading publishers, schools and early years providers to join forces in a bid to make English pupils the most literate in Europe in 5 years. Above all, the role of parents in getting their children reading is critical. To help parents get more children reading before they start school, the Department for Education has created new resources in conjunction with 4Children to equip parents and early years providers with high-quality activities and resources that help their children master the essentials of language. To ensure all children have access to our nation’s vast literary heritage, Nicky Morgan today (24 September 2015) also called on leading publishers to give secondary schools access to classic novels by great English authors such as Jane Austen, Charles Dickens or Emily Bronte at low cost, making sure every young person can discover and enjoy these classic works. These measures build on successful government reforms that have seen substantial and rapid progress towards tacking illiteracy since 2010. A strong emphasis on high-quality phonics teaching has enabled more children to master the essentials of reading quickly. At a speech made during a visit to Charles Dickens Primary School in London today, Education Secretary Nicky Morgan said: If a child fails to learn how to read, the consequences can be nothing short of devastating, holding them back for the rest of their lives. I am absolutely determined to make sure that every child, no matter where they live or what their background, learns to read, to read widely and to read well - giving them the best opportunity to get on in life. In fact, we’re going further than that - in the next 5 years, I want children in this country to become the best readers in Europe. David Walliams said: At the heart of this campaign is a very simple shared ambition - to get more children reading. Few things can compete with the joy of getting stuck into a good book and I believe that is something no child should miss out on. International surveys show that 9- and 10-year-olds in England are currently ranked sixth in Europe - although the best readers in this country are already the best readers in Europe. Nicky Morgan has said she wants to tackle the ‘long tail of underachievement’ which is still leaving too many children behind, in particular the most disadvantaged. The ambition set out today represents the next phase of an ambitious literacy campaign first launched in August. The campaign also includes partnering with the Reading Agency to extend its popular Chatterbooks model by creating at least 200 new book clubs across the country and a shared ambition to see every 8-year-old enrolled at their local library. To improve collaboration between schools, the Department for Education will also identify top primary schools with effective strategies for getting young people reading so that every school can learn from their success. This will ensure literacy teaching across all schools is built on the best evidence from organisations such as the Education Endowment Foundation. The literacy campaign is part of the government’s one nation approach to social justice which will ensure every child is able to reach their potential, regardless of birth or background. Evidence shows that children who develop strong reading skills early on are more likely to succeed at school, achieve good qualifications and go on to succeed in their adult lives and the world of work. Speaking today, Nicky Morgan added: There is no silver bullet, no magic wand we can wave to magically transform literacy for every child in this country. But we owe it to our young people to explore every possible path when it comes to getting them reading well, to break down any barriers, support any who are left behind - to introduce every child, from every background to our incredibly rich heritage of world-famous children’s literature. Then we can trust those books to do the rest. Notes to editors In August 2015 Nicky Morgan announced the first steps in the government’s literacy campaign, including: funding The Reading Agency to extend their popular Chatterbooks scheme and set up new book clubs in 200 more primary schools all over the country supporting The Reading Agency to work with schools and get more year-3 pupils enrolled at their local library to help more children get into the library habit early and address findings that show 1 in 7 children aged 8 to 16 rarely or never read outside of school [Contact:997]"
/government/speeches/elizabeth-truss-speaks-about-2-year-olds-policy-and-practice,"Please note that this text may not reflect the exact words of the speaker. I am really pleased to be here, and to have the chance to outline the government’s policies in relation to 2-year-olds. I also want to speak about early years pedagogy, because it is the basis of everything that follows. That is why our early learning programme will be open to 2-year-olds who are looked-after or whose background would make them eligible for free school meals. They will be offered 570 hours of early learning a year, which will typically be taken as 15 hours a week, but doesn’t have to be. So I want to start with a thank-you. There are promising signs that we are on track to deliver 130,000 places this September – in no small part due to the efforts of many of you in this room. These children can then continue to benefit from early education at 3 and 4, when all children can get 15 hours of it. But we have more work to do to meet our commitment to ensure all eligible 2-year-olds get a high quality place. This programme will be transformational. We know how important early education is. The Sutton Trust has found a 19-month vocabulary gap at age 5 between children from the poorest and most affluent families. 96% of parents already take up their child’s place for their 3- and 4-year-olds. But only 37% of 2-year-olds from the poorest 40% of families access any formal early education, compared to 78% of their richer peers. So there is very much a social mobility imperative here. All of us recognise the unfairness of a young child’s background having a lasting impact on their life. Scientific advances have shown us that the way a child’s brain develops in the first years of its life has a profound effect on their life chances. The gap in maths attainment between our country’s teenagers and those in Hong Kong and Singapore is already evident by the age of 5. The MPs Andrea Leadsom, Frank Field and Graham Allen – along with George Hosking of the WAVE Trust - have all published exhaustive reports that showed how high-quality early years education makes a big difference, especially to disadvantaged children, and referred to research that shows the massive effect of a child’s experiences before they turn three – by which age the brain is 80% developed. This is, of course, an opportunity for providers. It is a great chance for you to expand, to further support child development and improve outcomes. We are putting funding in but we need to know that it is going to providers who will make a difference. We are giving local authorities £525 million to fund 2-year-old places. There will be an average hourly rate of £5.09 across England. Every area will receive funding that equates to between £4.85 and £6.07 per hour. Nationally the funding compares favourably to the Daycare Trust Cost Survey 2013 which shows average hourly nursery fees in England are on average £4.26 across England. We have told local authorities to pass all available funding on to providers so that they can provide sustainable, high-quality places. But they must be good providers. The early education for 2-year-olds pilot showed that higher-quality settings have a positive impact on language ability at age three. In addition, across the scheme, parents typically felt that such settings had improved their parenting skills. All of which is a reminder of how important it is that local authorities are expected to fund places in settings that are rated good or outstanding by Ofsted. Sue Gregory - Ofsted’s National Director of Early Years - has highlighted the fact that regional variations in the quality of early years provision are too wide. In some local authorities 80% of early years providers were judged good or outstanding at their last inspection, but in others it was less than 60%. I want standards to rise across the board, and not only be high in certain pockets of the country. All the evidence shows that the No. 1 factor is people, and specifically the quality of engagement with children. The international evidence is clear. Andreas Schleicher of the OECD – who has welcomed our review into childcare practice - has said that “staff qualifications are the best predictor of the quality of early childhood education and care”. We know that teacher-led settings with larger groups of children are widely seen as the gold standard in the system. At every age we have studied, there is a benefit to involving graduates in education, and particularly so for pre-school-age children. As last year’s NAO report on early education for 3- and 4-year-olds explained some 96% of maintained nursery schools were judged good or outstanding by Ofsted. Settings that have a graduate leader have significantly improved outcomes, especially with language and literacy. And once again, these benefits are particularly acute for disadvantaged children. Crucially, not only are trained teachers the most effective in their interactions with children, but their supervision of less well-qualified staff made those staff better as well. Sue Gregory has said: Entry requirements for teaching, particularly in English and mathematics, are being strengthened. If this level of qualification is essential for teachers, why not for the early years? If we are serious about investing in the future, I believe that many more of those working with young children should be highly skilled and qualified to degree level. There are other countries where the majority of the early years workforce holds a degree-level qualification, unlike England where numbers are much lower. This just can’t be good enough. She is right. As you will be well aware, early years professionals are paid significantly less than primary school teachers, who earn £33,250 on average - a figure which compares favourably with France, where they earn £25,400, and Sweden, where they earn £23,250. Yet childcare workers in formal settings earn £13,300, in contrast to £22,450 in Sweden and £22,100 in the Netherlands. Supervisors and managers earn only £16,850, whilst in France and the Netherlands the averages are £23,950 and £34,400 respectively. This distance between the early years and primary schools is a mistake. It would be quite wrong to think that under-5s should have one sort of pedagogy and over-5s a completely different one. And it is wrong that early years staff are paid so much less than primary school teachers. Increasing qualifications will meet with some resistance. This country went through the same trajectory with teaching a few decades ago. The mushrooming of teacher numbers in the 1950s and 1960s had seen a lot of inexperienced and under-qualified people enter the profession. In the mid-80s Keith Joseph sought to improve training and development for teachers, insisting on higher standards in maths and English. His stance was not universally popular; but it was right. Play and structured learning are not opposites and nor does one stop at age five and the other one start. Rather, they are complementary. And there are real-world examples of this. At Woodberry Down School 9-year-olds learn fractions in a fun way in a programme known as ‘Go Fish’. I spent a good half-an-hour watching them, and they were engrossed and immensely engaged. Elsewhere, a teacher prepared 3 water trays at differing levels, with only the top tray full. Having made guttering, hosepipes and various other objects available, the teacher challenged the children to move the water in the top tray down to the bottom tray – thus providing an excellent lesson in the theory and practice of gravity. The best nurseries do similar, age-appropriate work for 3- and 4-year-olds. Alexandra Nursery School has a structured maths teaching programme that encourages counting at every opportunity – for example through songs and counting blocks when building a wall or ingredients when making a gingerbread man. Having got such a good head start, children are known to make significant progress when they leave the nursery. It would also be wrong for people in schools to take the view that life doesn’t begin before the age of 5. In fact, what we have learned about the brain shows that this is very far from the truth. I think we have a lot to gain from seeing early education and primary school as a continuum rather than as 2 completely separate things. This is the motivation behind our reforms on professional qualifications. We want to increase the number of trained teachers entering the early years. It is not a rebuke to those of you who have dedicated your lives to this profession and do not have these formal qualifications. And you are absolutely right to make the point that qualifications alone are inadequate – anyone working with children needs a whole range of other skills. Early years teachers, who will specialise in early childhood development, will face the same entry requirements and need to pass the same skills tests as trainee school teachers. I also want those working with children to have a good understanding of proven theories. Attachment theory would be one of these. It is well-established that secure bonds between children and adults provide safety, security and protection and also help children learn to socialise and form new relationships with their peers. As part of raising standards among professionals below graduate level here, people will train at level 3 to become early years educators. The National College for Teaching and Leadership will set out which rigorous qualifications are needed to earn that title. Being an early years educator will require at least a C in maths and English GCSE and the qualification will be the contemporary equivalent of the highly respected Nursery Nurse Diploma (which was discontinued in the mid-1990s). Just as there is no contradiction between structured, teacher-led learning and play, there is no contradiction between education and enjoyment! One of the great joys of young children is their sense of wonder and curiosity about the world. It is still concerning that there are so few teachers employed in early years and that 70% of settings do not take advantage of the higher ratios and graduate leadership. Our analysis suggests that it is affordable for nurseries but sometimes there is a resistance to the idea of larger groups. That is why I am pleased that Ofsted has confirmed today that qualifications will be a critical in how they judge a setting – with a view to getting many more qualified graduates into the sector. Ofsted has already adjusted the focus to be more heavily upon outcomes. Today Ofsted is announcing a greater focus in their inspection regime on qualifications, because it considers this a key to making it happen. Settings will be judged against a new framework from September, including a ‘requires improvement’ category. Ofsted proposes to re-inspect them within 24 months if they are judged to fall into that category. HMIs will be looking for highly qualified staff and Ofsted will clarify what it expects to see. It is also recruiting inspectors who can work across both primary and EY settings. Standards and requirements for HMIs will be as tough as for the settings themselves. Since September Ofsted has started keeping records of qualifications held by staff, which will be updated at every inspection. I welcome this new emphasis. The independent charity Teach First has done great work in encouraging top graduates to become teachers and so I am very pleased that from September recruits will begin working with children as young as 3, with more trainees beginning in September 2014. Over 2 years trainees will learn about teaching and leadership and undertake coursework and on-the-job training. I am absolutely clear that – although we should have strong accountability – we should give high quality providers more autonomy. Just as we are doing in schools where academies and free schools have greater freedom, so I want to see the same for the best practitioners in the early years sector. After all, there are lots of good ways to do early education - and although poor settings quite often look the same, 2 outstanding settings rarely do. In his report for the Department for Education on evidence-based learning, Dr Ben Goldacre wrote: I think there is a huge prize waiting to be claimed by teachers. By collecting better evidence about what works best, and establishing a culture where this new evidence is used as a matter of routine, we can improve outcomes for children, and increase professional independence. Too often moves by government or local authorities are interpreted as directions. I am clear that whereas government should set the ‘what’ and hold providers to account, it is for teachers and professionals to determine the ‘how’. I want to see confident practitioners, availing themselves of the best available evidence to deliver the early years foundation stage ( EYFS ) in the way they see fit, so long as outcomes for children are good. I also want to see practitioners well-versed in the evidence. This is very compatible with best practice that Sue Gregory outlined this week. We are seeking out good interaction between adults and children as well as encouragement for children to work with each other. For example, Toad Hall Nursery Group has family rooms in their nurseries, similar to a model which is popular in Scandinavia. Children aged between 2 and 5 learn and play together. Not only is the development of younger children boosted, but the older children behave better. I went to France this week to look again at how they do things there. There is a strong focus on structured learning, led by a qualified professional. I saw a teacher lead 8 2-year-olds in putting together a series of plastic discs for a good 20 minutes. I was captivated – and so were they. In fact, the 1 boy who had left to go and play with Lego came back because he felt he was missing out. I also saw 26 3-year-olds all following the steps of a dance teacher. There is a real culture in French nurseries of socialisation and interaction, rather than excessive tailoring to each child, which can mean that they miss out on the chance to take part in a purposeful activity together. There is also a premium on manners. In the best French nurseries that I saw, the children are recognisably happy and confident, and eager to learn. I saw teachers working very effectively on the kids’ vocabulary. They are even taught logic! And there is a comparatively seamless experience between early education and formal schooling. For their part, the French have also found much to like about nurseries in this country and also our regulatory structures through Ofsted. This exchange of ideas and best practice on an international level is thoroughly welcome. There are various myths about practice which sometimes can prevent the development of different ways of doing things and inhibit professionals developing their knowledge. It can also prevent new providers entering the sector with new ideas. So I want to clarify the position of the government. The EYFS is a framework that sets out the standards expected for children’s learning and development, and for their safety and wellbeing. It is not a straitjacket that requires professionals to operate in one particular way. And beyond the EYFS , there is no central guidance, because we expect professionals to take the lead – just as we do throughout the education system. For example, Development Matters is not statutory – it just outlines one possible approach and helps underpin inspections, rather than dictating. And we are reforming the role of local authorities so that their focus is on the champions of children and parents, not on setting out methodologies that nurseries should follow. And local authorities will no longer be able to withhold funding for not following their way of doing things – it really is up to you. From September Ofsted will have a revised framework for the early years. This framework will be more focused on child outcomes than any specific methodology. This will give early years professionals more freedom to tailor teaching to the specific needs of the children in their care. Let me dispel a few other common myths. These are things I have heard visiting nurseries that they tell me they are expected to do. I want to point out that they are required by neither government nor Ofsted: Free-flow play between outdoors and indoors is not a requirement and not something Ofsted is looking for. There is not a requirement to have a certain amount of child-led activity. There is no reason why children should not be part of structured groups and be encouraged to interact with each other. There is no requirement to fill in learning journeys. For each individual child there are just 2 pieces of writing: the 2-and-a-half year check and the EYFSP. And Clare Tickell in her report on the EYFS made very clear her view that adult direction was not inconsistent with the requirement of the EYFS for planned, purposeful play. She said that: Adults should be modelling, demonstrating and questioning. To exclude elements of teaching from the early years would increase the risk of children not being ready for the move to key stage 1. Of course that also means exercising professional judgement according to the children’s stage of development, or about the time of day things happen, or about what group structures are appropriate, or where a child may need something else. To this end, we’re working with Ofsted to make sure that all documents reflect this approach. With an increase in quality will come increased freedom for professionals – backed up by an improved and clearer inspection regime in which Ofsted will take the lead and ensure better accountability. The whole of government must be concerned about child development, and work together towards better outcomes. The Department for Education and the Department of Health are working together to implement an integrated review at age 2-and-a-half. The Healthy Child Programme already requires a health review at age 2, 2-and-a-half, and since September 2012 in the new EYFS there has been a requirement for parents to be provided with a written summary at age 2 of their children’s progress in the EYFS prime areas of learning. By 2015, we want to integrate these 2 processes. Our drive for higher standards is a recognition of the fact that the area in which you work is of immense importance. The stakes could scarcely be higher when we are talking about 2-year-olds, all of whom are infinitely precious and all of whom – no matter where they come – deserve the very best start in life. Thank you."

/government/news/record-numbers-benefiting-from-thriving-childcare-market,"Statistics released today (25 June 2015) show an unprecedented demand for childcare places thanks to the government’s offer of 15 free hours per week - resulting in 99% take-up from 4-year-olds and 94% take-up from 3-year-olds. The figures mean that around 650,000 3-year-olds and 675,000 4-year-olds currently receive funded early education - a total of over 1.3 million. The number of free hours is soon to rise to 30 hours for working parents, meaning their children will be able to benefit from 1,140 free hours per year - worth around £5,000 per year in their back pocket. Childcare providers have risen to the increased demand, and today’s statistics show that for the first time more than 1 million 3- and 4-year-olds get their funded hours in settings rated ‘good’ or ‘outstanding’ by Ofsted. Childcare Minister Sam Gyimah said: It’s fantastic that not only are more parents accessing free childcare, but more places are in top-quality settings. I’m delighted that we are extending this popular offer and doubling the number of free hours of high-quality childcare to working parents. No parent should be denied the childcare option that works best for their family, but costs have historically been a burden on family finances that prevented them from working if they wanted to. We are removing these barriers and giving parents the chance to return to work. Two-year-olds from the 40% most disadvantaged backgrounds are also eligible for 15 hours of free childcare per week. Today’s statistics show that around 157,000 2-year-olds are already benefiting following its introduction in September 2014, and that 85% attend good or outstanding settings. The Childcare Bill , introduced to Parliament this month, will double free childcare available for up to 600,000 families. The government has also committed to increase the average funding rate provided. A Department for Education review has already begun, overseen by Childcare Minister Sam Gyimah. A new government taskforce, headed by Minister of State for Employment Priti Patel, will also work to drive forward the plans to benefit working families. Notes to editors The statistics come from the provision for children under 5 years of age in England: January 2015 . The number of 4-year-olds receiving funded early education has risen by 16,540 from last year (658,680 to 675,220). The number of 3-year-olds receiving funded early education has risen by 5,440 from last year (641,230 to 646,670). The number of 3- and 4-year-olds attending settings rated as ‘good’ or ‘outstanding’ is 1,035,870 or 85%. This is up from 84% last year. The number of providers (excluding childminders) offering free places has grown, with an additional 3,690 providers offering places for 2-year-olds compared to 2014. The Ofsted ratings relate only to where statistics are available. Support for families put in place by the last government includes: an increase in Department for Education funding for childcare from around £5 billion per year to £6 billion per year funding 15 hours a week of free childcare for all 3- and 4-year-olds - an increase from 12.5 hours, saving families an additional £425 a year per child funding 15 hours a week of free childcare for around the 40% most disadvantaged 2-year-olds. This saves families over £2,500 a year per child legislating for tax-free childcare, which will save around 1.8 million working families with children under age 12 up to £2,000 per child per year increasing child tax credit entitlement up to £2,780 per year for families with 1 child, £480 more a year than 2010 introducing shared parental leave to help mothers back into the workplace when their children are still young The Childcare Bill legislation introduced to Parliament would place a duty on the Secretary of State for Education to ensure 30 hours of childcare is provided to 3- and 4-year-olds of working families for 38 weeks of the year. This includes the 15 hours currently available and the additional 15 hours. [Contact:997]"

/government/news/schools-minister-nick-gibb-responds-to-the-guardian-websites-claims-about-cutting-one-to-one-tuition-and-every-child-programmes,"Dear Sir Polly Toynbee is completely wrong to claim we are cutting support for children falling behind (The Guardian’s comment is free: 24/05/10). We’re actually doing exactly what the taxpayer expects - protecting core schools, college and Sure Start funding in the financial year 2010 to 2011 but not hesitating in cutting out bureaucracy, waste or unused spending. We are spending £256 million in the financial year 2010 to 2011 for 7- to 16-year-olds who need catch-up support in English or maths this year so no child due to receive help will miss out. But we are handing £47 million of centrally-held funding, unallocated by the previous government, back to the Treasury as part of our savings package. We will continue to spend £89 million this year in the Every Child schemes giving extra support for 5- to 8-year-olds in the three Rs. But we are able to release over £5 million, mainly from unallocated spending because the Department for Education had planned for a higher number of teacher leaders in writing than needed. All local authorities who want to take part in the programmes this year can still do so. And longer-term we are clear that while there will be difficult decisions ahead, we will take the right balance between urgent action to manage the public finances; protecting frontline education services; and using the pupil premium to give significant extra funding for disadvantaged children who need the most support. Yours faithfully, Nick Gibb Schools Minister [Contact:997]"
/guidance/2016-early-years-foundation-stage-assessment-and-reporting-arrangements-ara/section-5-legal-requirements-and-responsibilities,"## 5.1 Legal status of the ARA The ARA provides further guidance on the EYFS profile, which is set out in the statutory framework. The framework sets standards for development, learning and care of pupils from birth to the age of 5. The current [framework for the EYFS](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-years-foundation-stage-framework--2) can be found on GOV.UK.Section 40(2)(a) of the Childcare Act 2006 stipulates that early years providers must secure that their provision meets the learning and development requirements as specified in the EYFS (Learning and Development Requirements) Order 2007 (S.I. 2007/1772) (amended in 2014). The Act states that this Order can specify the arrangements which are required for assessing pupils for the purpose of ascertaining what they have achieved in relation to the early learning goals (ELGs).All English local authorities (LAs) must have regard to any guidance given by STA in exercising their function under the EYFS (Learning and Development Requirements) Order 2007, article 4(2). The learning and development requirements are given legal force by this Order made under section 39 (1)(a), 42 and 44 of the Childcare Act 2006.##  5.2 How the ARA applies to different EYFS settingsThe ARA applies to all early years settings including:*	all providers registered with a childminder agency*	all providers on the early years register (eg nurseries and childminders) *	maintained schools, non-maintained schools and independent schools with early years provision ###Academies and free schools in England  Academies must implement the requirements of the EYFS (by virtue of section 40 of the Childcare Act 2006). All references to academies include free schools, as in law they are academies. Unlike other key stages the EYFS profile must be moderated by the academy’s geographical LA. An academy must comply with its moderation requirements. All registered early years providers are required to complete the EYFS profile assessment for any pupils in the final year of the EYFS and to participate in moderation. This includes an academy providing for pupils in the final year of the EYFS. Funding for EYFS profile moderation activities for all schools rests within LA budgets. The DfE publishes information about [funding allocations for academies](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/funding-allocation-pack-2015-to-2016-academic-year).###Service children’s education schoolsService children’s education (SCE) schools are required to participate in early years national curriculum assessment and reporting arrangements in line with the arrangements for administration in England.###Overseas schoolsOther overseas schools which are not SCE schools can’t participate.###Hospital schools Pupils attending a hospital school are not subject to the assessment requirements in this ARA. Pupils still on the register at a maintained school but attending a hospital school are required to be assessed, and the results should be reported by the home school.###Home-educated pupilsThese assessment and reporting arrangements do not apply to pupils who are being educated at home, unless they are on the register of a maintained school or independent school.###Independent schools and EYFS providers registered with Ofsted under the Childcare Act 2006All independent schools and registered EYFS providers must comply with the information in the ARA unless they have an [exemption from the EYFS learning and development requirements]( https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-early-years-foundation-stage-eyfs-learning-and-development-requirements-guidance-on-exemptions-for-early-years-providers). This includes participating in moderation arrangements for the EYFS profile and submission of EYFS profile data to the LA (this data collection is governed by section 99 of the Childcare Act 2006), as specified in the table in section 2 of this ARA.Independent schools registered with the DfE that are not academies can take up an [exemption from the learning and development requirements](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-early-years-foundation-stage-eyfs-learning-and-development-requirements-guidance-on-exemptions-for-early-years-providers) if they meet the conditions set out in the Direction from the Secretary of State.###Settings with pupils who are not in receipt of government fundingUnder regulations made under section 99 of the Childcare Act 2006, LAs are allowed to collect specified data for pupils not in receipt of government funding in the summer term. EYFS providers are required to comply with LA requests for this data. LAs are not required to submit this data to the DfE. The LA can request data including:*	the learning and development category for each early learning goal (ELG) *	the pupil’s date of birth *	the home address where the pupil normally resides *	the pupil’s ethnic group *       the pupil’s gender *	whether the pupil has a special educational need *	if the pupil has English as an additional language ## 5.3 ResponsibilitiesAll those responsible for assessing and reporting on the EYFS need to refer to this ARA and make sure they are aware of any changes from previous years.The ARA provides guidance on the responsibilities of those involved in assessment and reporting for the EYFS. EYFS profile assessments must be completed for all pupils in the final year of the EYFS who will be 5 years old on or before Wednesday 31 August 2016, although some exceptions apply. They should read the section 2 of this ARA for information about exceptions. The EYFS profile must be completed no later than Friday 1 July. This date applies to all EYFS providers, including:*	all providers registered with a childminder agency*	all providers on the early years register (eg nurseries and childminders) *	maintained schools, non-maintained schools and independent schools with early years provision The EYFS profile must be completed by the provider at the setting where the pupil spends the majority of their time between 8am and 6pm. ###HeadteachersAll headteachers and managers of EYFS provision have a duty to implement the EYFS. Headteachers must ensure their school or setting complies with the learning and development requirements of the EYFS. This includes completing the EYFS profile and engaging with LA moderation activities. Headteachers must: *	ensure an EYFS profile is completed for all eligible pupils and data is quality assured*	ensure provision is made to meet the requirements of all pupils with special educational needs*	take responsibility for the reliability of their EYFS profile outcomes and ensure that the data accurately reflects the level of attainment of the current cohort of pupils *	ensure teacher judgements are monitored*	ensure EYFS profile data is returned to their LA in accordance with the table in section 4 of this ARA *	provide EYFS profile assessments to their school’s governing body to enable it to comply with national data submission requirements and report to parents*	ensure the statutory requirements for the transfer of records between providers are fulfilled, including the completion of the common transfer fileHeadteachers must also provide parents with a written report of the pupil’s  progress against the EYFS ELGs and the opportunity to discuss the profile. If a parent requests it, headteachers will need to provide a copy of the EYFS profile report on their child’s progress free of charge.###Local authoritiesLAs must ensure that EYFS providers understand and follow the requirements set out in the ARA by providing:*  advice on all aspects of assessment at EYFS *  training, including on ‘agreement trialling’‘Agreement trialling’ is the process of discussing assessment judgements in a group so that all practitioners understand the national exemplification of standards and apply them consistently. LAs must make sure assessments made by early years providers in their geographical area are accurate and consistent. LAs must do this by ensuring moderation of the EYFS profile is carried out in all schools, academies and other settings.In terms of data LAs must:*  ensure schools have a secure electronic system to submit EYFS profile data *  ensure all other EYFS providers have an appropriate means for accurately recording EYFS profile results, and submitting data to their LA if requested (see the table in section 2) *  collect EYFS profile data, and quality assure and submit it to the DfE in the required format by the due dates (see the table in section 2).LAs must also inform STA without delay of any irregularities in settings’ assessment arrangements.##5.4 DefinitionsIn the ARA, the term ‘parent’ as defined in section 576 of the Education Act 1996, includes:*	any person who is not a parent of a pupil  but who has parental responsibility for the pupil *	any person who has care of a pupilAll references to EYFS settings include any out-of-home provider of early years provision for pupils from birth to 5, for example:*	all providers registered with a childminder agency*	all providers on the early years register (eg nurseries and childminders)*	maintained schools, non-maintained schools and independent schools with early years provision *[EYFS]: early years foundation stage *[DfE]: Department for Education*[SCE]: Service Children’s Education*[LA]: local authority*[LAs]: local authorities"

/government/news/prime-minister-announces-landmark-wave-of-free-schools,"Prime Minister David Cameron today (9 March 2015) announced 49 new free schools for communities across the country, strengthening the government’s mission to give all parents the choice and security of a ‘good’ local school. The move brings the total number of free school places created since 2010 to almost a quarter of a million, making this policy the most successful new schools programme in national history with schools being created more quickly than ever before. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan hailed the policy for giving thousands of children the choice of attending an excellent local school ‘and the best possible education that prepares them for life in modern Britain’. In total more than 400 free schools have been approved since 2010, creating more than 230,000 school places across the country. Prime Minister David Cameron said: Delivering the best schools and skills for young people is a crucial part of our long term economic plan to secure a better future for Britain. Free schools set up by teachers, parents and community groups are not only outperforming other schools, but they are raising the performance of those around them, meaning more opportunities for children to learn the skills they need to get on in life. These new schools are an important part of our plan to improve education by raising standards and restoring discipline so our children can compete with the world’s best and enjoy a better future. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan said: Free schools give pupils the chance to attend an excellent local school. They are providing more choice than ever before to parents and ensuring that children have access to a high quality school place and the best possible education that prepares them for life in modern Britain. With the total number of approved free schools now rising to more than 400, the demand from parents, charities and education experts to set up the schools has proven the programme to be one of the most important modern drivers of social mobility. Today’s announcement sends a clear sign that children for generations to come will be able to benefit from a place in a free school. With already more than two-thirds being rated ‘good’ or ‘outstanding’, today’s news will reassure parents that standards will continue to rise. The schools announced today will meet the growing demand of parents for more ‘good’ local schools with high standards and strong discipline. One of these new schools includes the Northampton International Academy, which will benefit thousands of parents in the East Midlands. The new 2,220 place school will serve pupils from aged 3 to 19 and will offer an extended school day. The curriculum will focus on the study of modern languages at both primary and secondary level. Elsewhere, parents in Maidstone, Kent, are set to benefit from a new School of Science and Technology, a new STEM -focused school for up to 800 students, which will forge links with the Singapore School of Science and Technology to give pupils an international knowledge of science and commerce. But also announced today are a number of schools using the innovative powers of the free schools programme to transform the lives of many of society’s most disadvantaged and disaffected children. 17% of all free schools are dedicated to special needs or alternative provision ( AP ). One new school being designed will stop young offenders returning to prison. The Campus free school is the result of more than 3 years of collaboration between education and youth justice experts and will help up to 30 Haringey teenagers caught up in the cycle of crime to gain valuable qualifications, while giving them the support needed to avoid reoffending. Also announced today is a school that will harness the discipline of boxing to transform the lives of disaffected young people who have fallen out of the mainstream education system. The Boxing Academy will open as a free school in order to extend its offering to up to 56 pupils a year - 2 more classes than before. While pupils will not have to box, the sport’s ethos will be harnessed to help them channel their aggression and learn discipline and teamwork. Pupils will be mentored in small groups by boxers, while gaining valuable GCSEs including English and maths. Free schools are brand new schools set up by parents, teachers and charities in response to demand from the local community. Today’s announcement - the final wave of free schools to be approved before the general election - brings the total number of open and approved free schools to more than 400, creating around 230,000 new places often in the most deprived parts of the country. Through free schools and academies the government is taking power away from politicians and bureaucrats and handing it to heads and teachers. 72% of free school heads say they are having a positive impact on schools in their local area - driving up standards and ensuring more parents have a great school in their neighbourhood. More than 40,000 pupils are already attending free schools just 3-and-a-half years after the first one opened its gates. More than two-thirds are rated ‘good’ or ‘outstanding’ and 72% are located in areas with a shortage of places. 90% of today’s free schools will be located in areas with a shortage of places. With demand for childcare at an all-time high, ministers have also announced the government will finance free schools to offer nursery provision in the next wave of applications. For the first time, successful applicants will be able to use capital funding to create nursery places for 2-, 3- and 4-year-olds, where the government’s offer of 15 hours per week of free childcare can be provided. Notes to editors Just 27 academies were opened in the first 4 years of the academies programme (from 2002), while only 15 City technology colleges were opened in 5 years (from 1988).

/guidance/2016-early-years-foundation-stage-assessment-and-reporting-arrangements-ara/section-3-moderation,"## 3.1 Internal moderationThe moderation of EYFS profile assessments begins within each individual setting. It is supported by LAs, or LA approved agencies, through a programme of visits and meetings. Within their own settings, practitioners can agree assessment judgements with others informally. This might involve 2 practitioners, for example a teacher and a teaching assistant or a reception class teacher and a year 1 teacher, discussing evidence about a pupil’s development.## 3.2 Local authority responsibilitiesLAs have a statutory duty to make provision to ensure the accuracy and consistency of the assessments made by early years providers in their area. They must set up and carry out moderation arrangements to:*	secure the consistency and accuracy of judgements made by different practitioners*	reassure practitioners that their judgements are accurate, valid and consistent with national standards*	assure moderators that an acceptable level of accuracy and validity has been achieved for assessments  recorded and reported by the settings for which they have responsibilityModeration of the EYFS profile is a sampling process and not a method for checking each pupil’s attainment. LA moderation visits use discussion to check teachers’ ability to make accurate assessments and apply them consistently. Evidence discussed includes:*	materials*	knowledge of the pupil*	anecdotal incidents*	results of observations *	information from additional sources that supports the overall picture of a pupil’s development Evidence doesn’t need to be formally recorded or documented. The extent to which the practitioner chooses to record information will depend on individual preference. Paperwork should be kept to the minimum that practitioners need to illustrate, support and recall their knowledge of the pupil’s attainment. The outcome of moderation should be recorded.The [‘EYFS profile handbook’]( https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-years-foundation-stage-profile-handbook ) includes guidelines and examples of effective moderation practice for LAs. LAs must ensure that all providers are visited regularly as part of a cycle of moderation visits. They must be notified of whether the EYFS profile assessment is being carried out in accordance with requirements. 25% of settings must receive a moderation visit each year. LAs must inform settings which are due to receive a visit by the end of the spring term. For moderation purposes, these settings will need to complete interim judgements against all early learning goals (ELGs) at the beginning of May for pupils in the final year of the EYFS. All 17 ELGs must be scrutinised during the visit.Section 13 of the Childcare Act 2006 requires LAs in accordance with regulations SI 2014/2319 to secure the provision of information, advice and training, for childcare providers, prospective providers and childcare employees. LAs must offer training in EYFS assessment and the completion of the EYFS profile summaries to all providers who need it. 75% of settings must attend EYFS profile training (including agreement trialling activities).LAs must ensure that EYFS profile assessment judgements are moderated. This means appointing and training moderators with appropriate experience of the EYFS and the ELGs to secure consistent standards in assessment judgements.The LA moderator may judge that the assessment is not in line with the exemplified standards. If so, the LA can require the provider to:*	arrange for the practitioner to undertake further training or moderation activities*	reconsider their assessments as advised by the moderatorAll English LAs must have regard to this guidance by virtue of article 4(2) of the EYFS (Learning and Development Requirements) Order 2007. If an LA chooses to use a moderation model which doesn’t rely on moderation visits, they must ensure they can show that all the key elements of the moderation visit are protected. Any deviation from this guidance may be deemed as not meeting statutory requirements.##3.3 Headteachers', governing bodies' and managers’ responsibilitiesHeadteachers, governing bodies and managers of early years settings are responsible for the reliability of their EYFS profile outcomes. They must use quality assurance processes to ensure that the data accurately reflects the attainment of the current cohort of pupils.They must arrange for practitioners who are involved in completing EYFS profiles to take part in LA moderation activities at least once a year.If they receive an LA moderation visit they must meet reasonable requests from the LA moderator: *	to enter the premises to carry out the visit*	to amend assessments*	for practitioners to take part in further training or moderation activitiesIn addition they must:*	allow their LA to examine and take copies of documents and other articles relating to the EYFS profile and assessments *	provide their LA with such information relating to the EYFS profile and assessment as it may reasonably request They are also responsible for ensuring that any of their practitioners who are involved in making assessments have the opportunity to become familiar with effective practice. This may involve:*	attendance at training courses*	visits by moderators to settings *	moderation meetings within settings (in-house moderation) *	moderation meetings with practitioners from other settings *[EYFS]: early years foundation stage *[DfE]: Department for Education*[SCE]: Service Children’s Education*[LA]: local authority*[LAs]: local authorities"

/government/speeches/charlie-taylor-talks-about-developing-the-birth-to-18-system,"Thank you very much for coming here today. I think these opportunities for colleagues to meet, network and share ideas and challenges across the early years and schools are essential in order that we keep the momentum up in this dynamic and fast changing world. For 6 years I was the head of the Willows special school including First Steps nursery, which supported some of the most troubled children and families in west London. And during my teaching career I managed to work in every school age group, so I know that teaching - from early years through primary and secondary, in mainstream and special schools - is both a challenging and rewarding job. Over the last few years there has been a lot of talk about a self-improving, professional-led system and today I want to talk to you about that. My aim is for NCTL to support the development of an education system that is led by the best schools, early years providers, leaders and professionals working together for the benefit of our children. Wider context It is important for NCTL and for ministers to continue to understand the context and circumstances in which early years providers and schools work. I understand that things probably don’t feel easy at the moment. To some extent they never have and workers in the early years and schools are well accustomed to responding quickly and professionally to changes of government expectations, of funding, of inspection, of everything really. But I know this probably feels particularly tricky given the challenging situation with public funding. I know that local authority services are much smaller than they once were. And government expectations are changing - with factors such as the removal of the role of the LA in early years quality assessment, and many schools opting to become academies. But one thing stays the same - children and parents need high-quality education and care. That is an ambition shared by us all. So how will a professional-led system help you? It will mean that that the people who are the experts, doing the work on the ground, day after day, are the ones deciding on the content and focus of continuous professional development. They will be seeking out, recruiting and training the next generation of leaders and teachers to further professionalise and improve our schools and early years provision. Locally run CPD programmes are a great example of how schools and early years providers are already leading the system. They are designed to give leaders what they require and ask for, in order to fulfil their roles and continue to improve their settings. I know that some of you in the room may already have adopted a self-improving approach in developing programmes to enable your best leaders and practitioners to support others to improve. Nottinghamshire and Northampton are 2 excellent examples of this, offering peer mentoring schemes across their early years settings. The CPD programmes at the National Day Nurseries Association (NDNA) are another great example. These are the sector’s programmes - not what the government think is needed - and they’re already proving a huge success. There has been quite a lot of thinking on how schools can be self-improving, holding one another to account and offering support. We now want to extend this into the early years. However, we recognise this is a different context, not least because of the major role played by the PVI sector. This is one of the reasons I am here today and want to hear from you - as leaders - about how we can make this work. And make it work we must if we are to make all provision to be outstanding for all children. At the moment there is an 18-month vocabulary gap between children from low income and high income families when they arrive at school. Many children enter formal schooling already behind and we want to close this gap. Schools working alongside private and voluntary nurseries can help change this. We know that high-quality provision is particularly important for the most disadvantaged children. So how can we make a self-improving, birth-to-18 system a reality? First by helping leaders and providers to make the most of the reforms to improve the quality of the workforce. Ninety per cent of the success of any organisation is the quality of its workforce. The better the workforce, the better the outcomes for children. So we have expanded Teach First in schools and introduced Teach First for the early years - bringing even more of the brightest young graduates to work with even more of our most disadvantaged young people. And we have built on the early years professional programme to introduce the new status of early years teacher, equivalent to qualified teacher status, attracting even more high-quality graduates into a career in early education. We have developed a set of robust early years teachers’ standards to operate in parallel with the new teachers’ standards - identifying the essential elements that make a good teachers for children from birth to 18. The quality of graduates entering ITT has never been higher. And from this year the entry requirements for early years teacher training will be strengthened even further with the introduction of the skills tests and will be the same as for primary teacher training. Early years ITT will be delivered by accredited ITT providers who currently deliver QTS . This approach will locate early years teacher training with good and outstanding providers of ITT pushing up training quality even further. It is critical to continue to improve the quality of all staff in the early years workforce. So, from now on, Ofsted will include the qualifications of staff in their judgements of early years settings. School Direct was introduced to give schools more control over the training and development of their own workforce. The appetite for schools to become involved in initial teacher training through School Direct has been quite staggering. In the first year we had bids for 1,000 places, last year it was over 9,000 and this year schools asked us for 17,700 places including an increase in primary bids from 3,400 to 6,900. And now we want schools and nurseries to develop the next generation of early years teachers. We are extending School Direct to the early years for the first time - meaning that nurseries can have more involvement in the training of early years teachers. As a first stage, 59 School Direct (early years) places have been allocated for September 2014 to 6 early years teaching schools and the large nursery chain, Bright Horizons, so this is a shared project across the maintained and private sector. If it works out as well as we hope - and School Direct is already working very well in schools - next year will be bigger, and more schools and nurseries will be able to get involved. This is a fundamental part of the teacher-led, self-improving system - putting you in charge of developing the next generation of teachers. Second, as well as helping you to improve the quality of your workforce, we want schools and early years providers to support quality improvement locally - and for early years providers and schools to work more closely with each other as part of a self-improving, birth-to-18 system. Many early years providers will already have excellent relations with local schools making the transition to primary school a slick, well-organised process. But I would also bet that for some, transition is not as smooth as it should be for such an important and challenging change. Communication is not clear, busy people cannot find time to meet and discuss more complex children. And I am afraid some schools simply do not understand the importance of transition and discount the essential work of early years providers. In a system led by schools and early years providers, we must break down and challenge the divides that can exist between schools and early years. In addition to observing and visiting, there is more that can be done if these boundaries are broken down. In the future we should be seeking opportunities to share expertise, resources and knowledge to improve children’s learning and achievement. And I don’t mean just that schools should pass on their insight to early years providers, I mean both ways. The more schools and early years providers are able to collaborate and work together, the better the outcomes for children. With the reduction in some LA services, early years providers and schools need to be looking elsewhere for support. I see this as a great opportunity to develop partnerships and put early years provision at the heart of local networks. A birth-to-18, self-improving system will use the best leaders and the best professionals to support others. We want early years providers to fully embrace their role in children’s education and to play an important part in working with others towards achieving a world-class birth-to-18 system. The expertise and experience that exists in the early years sector means they have so much to give to this approach. It makes sense, in particular for children and families, that the work of early years and schools is interconnected and treated accordingly. Parents want to see continuity, so do children. I would love to hear examples of where this practice is already well-established so that we can help to share more widely. But I also recognise that early years is a very different landscape from schools and we want to give professionals the freedom and flexibility to deploy a range of methods and to decide how best to structure children’s activities throughout the day. These include a combination of teacher-led group activities where children learn to interact with each other; such as using shape sorters, using bricks and Lego to build, story-time - and free play and exploration. This is ultimately about trusting the profession - giving professionals more responsibility for quality improvement, and putting the profession at the heart of the system. This will contribute to greater motivation, better retention and higher standards across the workforce. We know from schools what a difference it makes for teacher motivation when they work beyond the boundaries of a single organisation on peer improvement. There are already almost 300 (291) early years specialist leaders of education supporting quality improvement. There is a growing number of early years teaching schools and alliances where early years providers are key strategic partners. These teaching schools and alliances are already developing opportunities for joint CPD and practice development. For example Bristol early years teaching consortium have designated early years specialist leaders of education that can offer support across the birth to 7 age range, including family support workers. Teaching schools are central to the delivery of the government’s vision for a self-improving, school-led system. Teaching schools are amongst the best schools in the country. They are outstanding in their own performance and have a track record of working with others to raise standards for children beyond their own school. Maintained nursery schools are already engaged in this vision. Sixteen nursery schools are already designated as teaching schools and over 50 more are formally linked into teaching school alliances: many of which already have strong links with their local PVI settings and childminders. This number increases still further when we include schools with registered nursery provision to over 100 teaching schools and over 1,000 more formally linked into teaching. Everton Nursery School and Family Centre, who lead the North Liverpool Teaching School Partnership and St Edmunds Nursery School and Children’s Centre, who lead the Bradford birth to 19 teaching school alliance, are great examples of this, bringing together early years providers and schools through their alliance to support, encourage and drive quality improvement locally. We want to strengthen this even further and encourage more early years engagement in a self-improving education system, so that quality improvement is driven locally by the best leaders. Through the teaching schools research and development network, 20 teaching schools are testing and developing models to build on their existing alliances and increase early years engagement. A final evaluation report is due by the end of this year. But we need to do more. The affordability and availability of childcare is a major barrier to work amongst parents of the under 5s. There is a strong demand for a greater number and range of nurseries providing childcare. And without suitable provision it is difficult for young families to be able to find good quality places for their children that are convenient for their journeys to work. The government wants to make it easier for nurseries and childminders to expand by extending the planning relaxations recently introduced for state-funded schools - such as using vacant office space - to nurseries. It also wants to encourage more schools to offer nursery places for 2-year-olds and to extend the availability of childcare. Schools offer a popular and convenient option for some parents. We all want the norm to be high-quality opportunities for peer to peer learning and improvement and we know that much of the best learning is generated by the sector for the sector. In developing a self-improving birth to18 system we need to break down the barriers preventing great practice and expertise from being shared and reciprocated. This will benefit all children entering and progressing through our education system. So we need to be listening to and learning from early years providers. What are the barriers stopping them leading improvement across settings within a birth-to-18 system? How can we realise the benefits of such a system for settings and the families they serve? What more can we do to support early years to become an integral element of it? It is important for all providers to think about collaboration rather than isolation or competition. To seek out opportunities to work in local partnerships with schools to develop new approaches to supporting quality improvement and school readiness. We want to see early years leaders play a full role in local partnerships to improve quality and to recruit, train and assess early years teachers. This is a real opportunity - building upon the great work you have already done and continue to do in improving children’s lives. I hope you will come with us on this journey to help make this vision a reality."
/government/news/317-million-boost-for-life-changing-send-reforms,"The Department for Education has today (17 December 2014) announced it will invest a further £31.7 million in 2015 to 2016 to help local authorities in England continue to meet the costs of implementing the special educational needs and disabilities ( SEND ) reforms. Children and Families Minister, Edward Timpson, said: Our reforms put children and parents right at the heart of the system. We’re on the beginning of a journey to provide simpler, improved and consistent help. Local councils have made a strong start in implementing these life-changing reforms, but we want to give them more help to take delivery to the next level. The timescale has always been for them to bring children into the new system over the next 3 years - this extra money will help them to do that. Edward Timpson has today also invited Ofsted to formally inspect local areas on their effectiveness in fulfilling their new duties. They will do this along with the Care Quality Commission and a local authority officer. It is hoped that robust and rigorous inspections will ensure that parents and young people receive as much information as possible about what is being offered. In England 1 in 5 children has SEND , ranging from dyslexia to a physical impairment. The government’s reforms will enable them and their parents to have a role in shaping the support they receive. The SEND code of practice requires local authorities, health bodies, schools, maintained early education settings and colleges to carry out statutory duties for children and young people with SEND . The reforms extend provision from birth to 25 years of age. This will give families greater choice in decisions and ensure needs are properly met. The new system extends rights and protections to young people by introducing a new Education, Health and Care plan. Professionals will also provide more tailored support to families, giving them the help and assistance they need. The Department for Education has also worked with Mencap to publish today for the first time easy-read guides for young people with SEND and their parents that explain the reforms to the system. Dean Meuleman, who works for Mencap and has a learning difficulty, said: Easy-read is one way of making information easier to understand and use. It uses simple words, short sentences, bullet points and pictures. All these things help people with a learning disability understand important information. It can make a real difference to people’s lives. The changes to the law on SEND will affect parents and young people with a learning disability. They have a right to understand these changes and how they will impact them directly. I hope that these new easy-read guides will help people with a learning disability to make the best choices and decisions for themselves. Further information and links to the guides are available on the Mencap website . Notes to editors Read about SEND implementation grant allocations by local authority . As well as the £37.1 million to help local authorities implement the SEND changes, the government is also today giving authorities details of their dedicated schools grant allocations for next year, which will include an extra £47 million. Read Dedicated schools grant 2015 to 2016 for further information. Councils are required to publish a ‘local offer’ showing the support available to all disabled children and young people and their families in the area. Since the reforms went live in September, all local authorities have published local offers and 94% of parent carer forums say they feel engaged with the reforms. The additional funds build on the £45.2 million funding for 2014 to 2015 and the earlier special educational needs reform grant of £70 million. The money will support local authorities to transfer children and young people with SEN statements and learning difficulty assessments to new education, health and care ( EHC ) plans in an ordered way. All children and young people with statements will be transferred to EHC plans by April 2018. The government is providing more than £2 million for parent carer forums. We have invested £30 million in recruiting independent supporters so families who are new to the system can get help. The parents’ guide to the code has been downloaded over 42,000 times. The new system will extend rights and protection to young people by introducing a new birth to 25 education, health and care plan. Professionals will also provide more tailored support to families, giving them the help and assistance they need. The new package of ambitious changes transforming the support on offer came into force in September. The new system will: replace SEND statements and learning disability assessments with a new birth-to-25 education, health and care plan - setting out in one place all the support families will receive require better co-operation between councils and health services to make sure services for children and young people with SEND and disabilities are jointly planned and commissioned give parents and young people with education, health and care plans the offer of a personal budget - putting families firmly in charge introduce mediation for disputes and trial giving children and young people the right to appeal if they are unhappy with their support introduce a new legal right for children and young people with an education, health and care plan to express a preference for state academies, free schools and further education colleges - currently limited to maintained mainstream and special schools [Contact:997]"
/government/news/phonics-reading-check-and-key-stage-1-results-published,"National, regional and local authority results for the year 1 phonics reading check and key stage 1 results are published today. The results for the phonics reading check show that 58% of six-year-olds reached the expected standard (32 out of 40). Thanks to the check, teachers have identified over 235,000 pupils who will now receive additional reading support from the school. The check is a short, light-touch assessment of the phonic skills of pupils at the end of year 1. It assesses their ability break down and blend words using systematic synthetic phonics, the internationally proven method of driving up reading standards, especially in children aged five to seven. It was piloted in June 2011, involving around 9,000 children. Independent evaluation of the pilot, conducted by the Centre for Education and Inclusion Research (CEIR), found that: 43% of pilot schools were able to identify pupils with reading problems of which they were not already aware. 83% of teachers said the number of words was suitable; 80% said the type of vocabulary was suitable; and 74% thought the non-words used were suitable. The experience of the check was positive for most pupils. The check took on average between four and nine minutes to complete per pupil. Education and Childcare Minister Elizabeth Truss said: The reading check helps teachers identify those pupils who need extra help in learning to read. Many thousands of children will now receive the extra support they need to develop a love of reading. Today’s publication also shows that there has been a slight rise in the percentage of pupils reaching the expected level - level 2 - across all areas of the teacher-assessed key stage 1 subjects - reading, writing, speaking and listening, maths and science. Percentage of pupils reaching level 2 or above Subject 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Reading 84 84 84 84 85 85 87 Writing 81 80 80 81 81 81 83 Speaking and listening 87 87 87 87 87 87 88 Mathematics 90 90 90 89 89 90 91 Science 89 89 89 89 89 89 89 Commenting on the key stage 1 results, Elizabeth Truss added: I congratulate pupils, families and teachers on their hard work and achievements. The government is committed to improving performance by raising expectations, giving new freedoms to schools and increasing teachers’ professional responsibility. Notes to editors The phonic reading check and key stage 1 test results published today are available on the Department for Education’s website. 592,010 pupils in state-funded schools (including academies) took the reading check in June this year - 2% of the pupils were dis-applied. The reading check is a short informal assessment of a pupil’s ability to decode phonics: They sit one-on-one with a teacher they know, and is asked to read 40 words aloud - 20 real words and 20 pseudo-words. The pseudo-words are important to include because they cannot be read by memory or vocabulary - children have to use their decoding skills so it is a fair and accurate way to assess ability to decode. The check normally takes a few minutes to complete. There is no time limit. If a child is struggling, the teacher can stop the check early. The check is designed not to be stressful for children. Pupils who do not meet the expected standard on the check should receive extra help from their schools, so they can catch-up with their peers. Systematic synthetic phonics is the internationally proven method of driving up reading standards, especially in children aged five to seven. The Department for Education published an evidence note detailing some of the research supporting the use of phonics as the most effective method to teach children how to read. It includes the findings of a number of studies, including: A seven-year study in Clackmannanshire, Scotland, of the teaching of synthetic phonics to 300 children found they made more progress in reading and spelling than other children their age. A 2005 Australian report, Teaching Reading, which said: The incontrovertible finding from the extensive body of local and international evidence-based literacy research is that for children during the early years of schooling (and subsequently if needed) to be able to link their knowledge of spoken language to their knowledge of written language, they must first master the alphabetic code: the system of grapheme-phoneme correspondences that link written words to their pronunciations. Because these are both foundational and essential skills for the development of competence in reading, writing and spelling, they must be taught explicitly, systematically, early and well. The US National Reading Panel report of 2006, which said: Systematic synthetic phonics instruction had a positive and significant effect on disabled readers’ reading skills. These children improved substantially in their ability to read words and showed significant, albeit small, gains in their ability to process text as a result of systematic synthetic phonics instruction. This type of phonics instruction benefits both students with learning disabilities and low-achieving students who are not disabled. Moreover, systematic synthetic phonics instruction was significantly more effective in improving low socio-economic status (SES) children’s alphabetic knowledge and word reading skills than instructional approaches that were less focused on these initial reading skills… Across all grade levels, systematic phonics instruction improved the ability of good readers to spell. The phonics evidence report can be accessed on the Department for Education’s website. The reading check was piloted in about 300 schools in June 2011 - 229 of these came from a nationally representative sample. In total, 8,963 children participated in the pilot from schools in the representative sample. 582,500 pupils took the key stage 1 assessments this year.

/government/speeches/edward-timpson-improving-access-to-physical-education-and-sports,"Thank you, Sue [Baroness Sue Campbell]. I’m delighted to be able to join you all this afternoon for what I know is a landmark conference. Twenty years on, and it’s been another great year for the Youth Sport Trust in providing access to sport and inspiration to thousands of children. And today, all of us here are united by a single belief - that sport changes lives for the better. Whether you prefer a racquet to a rugby ball or a swimming cap to a skateboard - just getting involved can make you a happier and healthier person. And a big part of that is having somebody to inspire you as a youngster. For me, as I’m sure I’ve told many of you before, that person was Big Joe Corrigan. This time, however, I’ve come armed with photographic evidence. Growing up in the early 1980s, the Manchester City and England goalie was my sporting hero. As you can see, even in snowy weather, I’d be outside, fielding shots from my big brother, pretending to be Big Joe - attempting spectacular finger-tip saves, and imagining, unlike him, I’d saved that winning and still-grating Ricky Villa goal for Spurs in the 1981 FA Cup Final replay. Meeting him has got to be one of my top moments to treasure. And when Tottenham Face Chelsea in the League Cup final next month, I’m sure there’ll be thousands of children, eagerly cheering on Petr Cech and Michael Vorm - if they’re picked! - in the same way I would have Big Joe. Because, although certain sports and sports players will fall in and out of fashion, a passion for sport can be passed down, generation to generation, and should remain a feature of every child’s upbringing. And we know that the early years of physical education are the most important - that’s why we chose to target primary schools with £450 million of premium funding, to improve PE and sport for children across the country. And importantly, we’ve put the power in the hands of headteachers - those who know their pupils best - to decide what to do with the cash to maximise its impact. But we also know that exercise faces huge competition when it comes to what children want to spend their free time doing. It’s easy to see why so many young people live sedentary lives. The appeal of the newest computer game - Minecraft and Skylanders are current favourites in our household - or the magnetism of screen-time on iPads all contribute to children moving less and losing out - something the YST ’s ‘Future foundations’ report called the “digitally distracted”. And this has real and lasting consequences: Just the other week, we learned that children as young as 2 were being hospitalised for obesity. And a recent King’s College report places a third of middle-school children in the obese bracket. But the report also offers hope that these figures are levelling out. With the help of programmes like Change 4 Life, which has attracted 350,000 pupils to take part in sports clubs, we’ve managed to stem the rise in obesity we saw in the preceding decade. But maintaining a healthy weight isn’t the only spur to an active and sporty lifestyle - it’ll reduce the risk of heart disease, stroke and type 2 diabetes. And we know that regular physical activity goes further than just physical health, and can even guard against depression. Being active is central to good mental health. For me, I run marathons not just for my body, but for my mind too. Mo Farah’s trainer, Alan Watkinson, has said that the energy Mo put into his training also helped him focus on his studies. If it’s good enough for Mo, it’s good enough for me! And children themselves know just how important sport is for a healthy lifestyle, so we need to set them up to succeed and not fail. And that’s where the primary PE and sport premium comes in. It’s allowed schools both to invest and improve the quality of PE and sport as well as provide new opportunities for their pupils. And we know just how important it is- that’s why it’s the only money for schools that is ring-fenced, to be spent solely on school PE and sport. So how is it helping? Well, since the introduction of the funding in 2013 around 18,000 schools have been in receipt of the premium, and an independent analysis of its impact clearly demonstrates that headteachers and their staff have started to transform PE and sport. Cedars Primary School, in Milton Keynes, has decided to use their allocation - a little over £9,000 - to employ a specialist PE teacher, as well as working on greater participation in sports at lunchtime. And just down the road at Glastonbury Thorn Primary School, they’ve put their funding of just under £10,000 towards a specialist teacher, too. They’ve also expanded their extracurricular timetable, and purchased new equipment to broaden the curriculum. Last week I visited the fantastic Brackenwood Junior School on the Wirral, where I met Kevin Byrne, Head of PE and the cluster group leader for 12 local primary schools. Kevin told me that thanks to the premium, staff are more competent at teaching PE and - across the cluster - the number of children taking part in after-school clubs has more than doubled. On the back of these changes, Brackenwood are now finally able to enter inter-schools competitions, and have given pupils access to new after-school clubs like basketball and hockey. They’ve also introduced PE into other areas of the curriculum, with 1930s jive dance being taught alongside the Second World War - proving that cross-curriculum lessons not only work, but can be of benefit to your health, too! As these and many other primary schools have demonstrated, the premium is having a very real, positive impact and - importantly - has been designed for the future to ensure a long-term, sustainable approach to physical education. For instance, more teachers have been trained to take children out on to sports pitches and playing fields. And the subject has been firmly embedded into the curriculum - something I sincerely hope will outlast parliamentary terms. And perhaps most crucially of all, the Prime Minister has personally committed to funding the primary PE and sports premium into 2020 - an additional £750 million that will ensure the progress you have made will not be lost. And with stronger Ofsted accountability over how schools are spending premium money, physical wellbeing is sure to remain a firm priority. Victoria Pendleton, amongst our most illustrious Olympic gold medallists, has said that the premium “gives teachers an opportunity to get creative about the activities they offer”. She added that “you can’t beat the life lessons that competitive sport offers”. And I couldn’t agree more. The premium will allow us to support budding Pendletons or Farrahs. And as Jess Ennis-Hill has said, it will “spark an interest” in sports at a young age. It’s great of course to know that these sporting stars and role models, who’ve achieved so much for our country, can see the good in what we’re doing. But the people we really need to embrace and lead our work on this are headteachers and teachers - those who are bringing the funding to life. None more so than the first 120 specialist PE teachers, trained through a National College pilot. Since September, these highly trained graduates have put their expertise and love of sport into delivering the calibre of PE lessons we need. John is one of those 120, and is now in place at Moorlands Junior School. He used to be a professional rugby league player - representing Ireland and Oldham - and now takes part in downhill mountain biking and cross-fit. He sounds less like a teacher and more like a professional trainer. John says he’s excited by the new concept of specialist PE teachers, and that the experience at his training school, Ashton on Mersey, was he said “life changing”. In helping make all this happen, the Youth Sport Trust has been a stalwart for schools seeking support with their funding and professional development, and I want to put on record my continued gratitude to Sue and the YST team in being such an integral part of our collective push on PE and sport in our schools. Importantly, that work is complemented by other growing initiatives, like School Games, which has got nearly 30,000 disabled children involved, and is the only youth programme that has seen girls outnumber boys at last year’s games, accounting for 52% of participants. We’ve also seen health and wellbeing boards, local councils and sports governing bodies take the funding very seriously too. And, for me, it’s these all-encompassing collaborations have contributed to such promising progress. But, as ever, there is always more we can do. Particularly when it comes to encouraging more girls to take part. Girls, and women, face a whole other set of inhibiting factors to participation. YST ’s own ‘Girls’ active’ report shows women and girls are put off sport because of fears about how they look or how they will be perceived. It doesn’t help when top seed tennis stars are asked to ‘do a twirl’ at the Australian Open - reducing their incredible sporting achievements to the clothes on their backs. Thankfully, most commentators found the request as patronising as the rest of us. Because women and girls in sport deserve to feel that they are on a level playing field with their male peers. And there are some incredible role models out there - women like Stephanie Roche, who narrowly missed out on FIFA ’s prestigious Puskas award. If you haven’t seen her goal yet, watch it online - it’s an absolute cracker, one even Big Joe Corrigan would’ve struggled to save. And Ebonie Jones, a British boxer who’s been crowned European Champion at just 16-years-old. Some of you have also seen the This Girl Can campaign on adverts and posters around the country. It’s a great, honest campaign led by my colleague Helen Grant, the Sports Minister, that’s inspiring more girls and women to follow the lead of Stephanie and Ebonie, and have a go at sparring, or joining a 5-a-side. As research by YST has demonstrated, good leadership can help girls to see their bodies and aptitude for sport in a much more positive light - and even feel better about school in general. So I hope This Girl Can, with its positive messaging, will go some way towards encouraging more women to discover the benefits of exercise. We also want the legacy of the Paralympic Games to live on just as much as the Olympic Games - and our investment in Project Ability is helping staff to deliver better sports activities to thousands of disabled student students in both mainstream and special schools. One teacher in North Warwickshire described inclusive competition in her area as “flourishing” and that Project Ability had increased opportunities for all young people. I’d love for the teachers and headteachers among you to consider what your premium funding can do to enhance the activities on offer for young disabled students - and what a fantastic legacy that would be for your schools to leave. To help you achieve just that, I’m pleased to be able to announce today the extension of the Project Ability programme for another year, with around £300,000 of additional funding to do so. The funding will ensure that Project Ability can grow and extend its reach, as well as to drive and test innovative ways of support for all disabled young people to access and excel at PE and sport. So - what do we want the child of 2035 to look like? Ideally, obesity in childhood will be a thing of the past. Children will be eager to try new sports, and will be fulfilling or even exceeding their target of an hour’s activity a day. Better yet, sports halls and fields will be packed with as many girls as boys, supported by encouraging and motivating teachers - because thanks to the premium, it’s down to the professionals, with even greater control, to help build a generation of fit and active children. For me, 30 odd years ago, Big Joe gave me the inspiration to go on and play competitive football and run marathons. But today, the inspiration need not be on a pitch a hundred miles away - but much closer to home, in teachers, coaches and club leaders. And of course, parents. Parents like me and you - who are from a generation that has benefitted so much from having PE and sport as a constant feature in our lives. But, as much as I hate to admit it, it’s not about me anymore. It’s about our children and our grandchildren - ensuring they too get to experience, as a rite of passage, all that physical activity and sport has to offer, giving them every chance of leading healthy, active lives. Children like my son Sam, seen here on sports day, straining every sinew to keep that egg expertly lodged on that spoon whilst hurtling full pelt towards the finish line. I love this photo, because it reminds me of my own discovery of a lifelong love of sports that’s helped shape my future in so many positive ways. Whether my son’s been inspired to do likewise, time will tell. But what’s important is that we open up that opportunity to all children, regardless of their background, or start in life - to be inspired by sport, and see the real value in a physically active life - so that they, in turn, allow the pupils of 2035 to benefit from a legacy that we can be proud to call our own. Thank you."

/government/news/ofsted-launches-consultation-on-childminder-agency-inspections,"The government’s Children and Families Bill 2013 will allow for the creation of childminder agencies. They will help childminders with training, support, advice and networks. The aim is to better support existing childminders, attract new high quality providers into the market, and provide more choice for parents. In light of this development Ofsted will need to have a framework for regulating childminder agencies, the first of which are set to be created later this year once the legislation is on the statute books. In developing this framework, Ofsted has sought to maximise its knowledge and experience in regulating and inspecting similar services. Ofsted proposes: there should be a judgement on the overall effectiveness of the childminder agency; childminder agency inspection judgements should be made against the four point scale of outstanding, good, requires improvement and inadequate; childminder agencies should have no notice of Ofsted inspections; Ofsted inspectors should take into account the way in which childminder agencies use self-evaluation to improve; inspection judgements should take into account the views of individual childminders and parents; and inspection reports should be published on the Ofsted website. Lorna Fitzjohn, Ofsted National Director of Childminding and Regional Director for the West Midlands, said: Childminders will have the option of joining an agency from later this year. We want to make sure that they are inspected in a way that is fair to agencies and which gives assurance to parents. As the inspectorate and regulator, we will have a big role in helping childminder agencies in improving the quality of early years provision. Our inspectors will work with agencies to help drive improvements and give young children at least a good start in life. [Contact:2325]"

Object to a registration decision You can object to a decision if you’ve been sent a notice of intention or if you don’t agree with any conditions placed on your registration. You must object within 14 days of the date on the notice of intention. Ofsted will consider your objection then tell you if you’re still refused registration. If you don’t object, or you’re still refused registration after objecting, you’ll get a second letter called a ‘notice of decision’. This is the final decision to refuse registration. Appeal against a registration decision You can appeal to an independent tribunal against a registration decision made by Ofsted. You must appeal within 3 months of the date that you’re sent the notice of decision. Withdraw your application You must tell Ofsted if you want to withdraw your application. If you don’t, the application will continue and may be refused if you don’t meet all the requirements. A refusal disqualifies you from providing registered childcare in the future.

Resigning from the register doesn’t affect any future application you make to provide childcare. What to register as You’ll need to say what type of childcare you want to provide when you apply. You may need to register as more than one type of provider, eg as both a childminder and a childcarer on domestic premises if you work with 3 or more other childminders or assistants on some days. Type of childcare you want to provide What you register as Taking care of children in a home that’s not their own (usually your own) with up to 2 other people Childminder Caring for children of up to 2 families at the same time in their homes, eg a nanny or an au pair Home childcarer (voluntary part of the Childcare Register only) Caring full time for children in someone’s home with at least 3 other people Childcare on domestic premises Setting up a nursery, pre-school, out-of-school club or holiday playscheme Childcare on non-domestic premises If you want to register as both a childminder and a home childcarer you can register on the same form. You’ll need to fill in separate applications for all other types of childcare. Setting up a nursery or pre-school You’ll need to register as a childcare provider on domestic or non-domestic premises if you want to set up a: nursery pre-school out-of-school club holiday playscheme You must make a separate registration for each premises where you take care of children. You can register as an individual or as an organisation, eg a partnership, company, committee or statutory body. If you’re applying as an organisation, then you’ll still be known as the ‘registered person’. Registering as an organisation You must appoint a ‘nominated person’ to make the application, eg a committee member, partner, director or someone in a comparable position. If the nominated person doesn’t manage the childcare themselves then you must employ a manager before you can be registered. If childcare is not your organisation’s main purpose (eg you’re a manufacturing company providing care for your staff’s children) then the nominated person should be the most senior officer of the company who has direct responsibility for the childcare. It’s your responsibility to ensure that any person caring for, or in regular contact with children is suitable to work with children."

/government/speeches/nareys-report-on-initial-training-for-childrens-social-workers,"Children’s social work is one of the most demanding careers a person can pursue, with the power to transform the lives of deeply disadvantaged children. It requires a unique and highly complex set of skills and knowledge. When those skills and that knowledge are not present, lives which might have been transformed immeasurably for the better can be left damaged instead. Today we publish an independent report , by former Barnardo’s chief executive Sir Martin Narey, which reveals a training system which in too many universities is not fit for purpose. He concludes that entry demands are not high enough, the system of endorsement of courses is insufficiently rigorous, and the content of those courses too generic. The result is a failure to protect the most vulnerable children in our society. While Sir Martin stresses that some fine social work courses do exist, in too many universities and in many social work texts, social work training can be dominated by an emphasis on inequality, empowerment and anti-oppressive practice. As Sir Martin Narey says, “sometimes, parents and other carers neglect and harm children. In such circumstances, viewing those parents as victims, seeking to treat them non oppressively, empowering them or working in partnership with them can divert the practitioner’s focus from where it should be: on the child.” Sir Martin argues that there is too much theory, not enough good practical experience. Training for children’s social work ought to include: recognition of the signs of abuse, understanding of the impact of child abuse and neglect in very early years and beyond, assessment and analytical skills, training in how to question and engage parents and children, a sound knowledge of the evidence base around parental capacity and effective intervention including how to prepare a child to move home, either in an emergency or to a new permanent family, management of risk, the legal framework, and child development. To learn how to apply this knowledge in practice, training must always include a placement in a statutory setting. Sir Martin reveals there are some good undergraduate courses, and there are many better masters-based entry routes - but too many social workers are leaving university today ill-prepared for their vital role working to protect at risk children. Children’s social work requires a uniquely fine balance of moral, legal, practical and psychological considerations; challenge as well as support; a hard intellect as well as a generous heart. Too many prospective social workers, as Sir Martin also reports, are entering university ill-equipped to meet those demands. Between 2003 and 2012, no fewer than 307 social work degree courses at 83 institutions were formally approved, with a rapid increase in the number of entrants and worryingly low entry standards: less than a third of those on undergraduate courses had one or more A levels. The failure rate on these courses was just 2.5%. We want to see universities demand more of prospective social workers. We accept Sir Martin’s recommendation to set out, in one place, what a newly qualified children’s social worker needs to understand, based first on a definition of what a children’s social worker is, work which is being led by the Chief Social Worker for Children, Isabelle Trowler. And we want to see university students committed to working with children specialise in children’s issues both academically and in their practice placements. The Chief Social Worker is also developing plans for the introduction of a more rigorous testing regime for children’s social workers, including a license to practice examination, continuing professional development and compulsory revalidation; and I am personally supportive of this work. The Frontline and Step Up to Social Work programmes are leading the way in increasing the ambition of children’s social work; more traditional entry routes must, at all universities, have similar aspiration. We want to do for social work what has been done so successfully for teaching: raise the status of the profession and the quality of those wishing to join it through higher quality entry routes and training. The cluttered landscape of standards and university endorsement criteria should be cleared, and the criteria sharpened. We shall consider Sir Martin’s recommendations for a single body to approve and audit children’s social work training; and further consider how to strengthen regulation of the profession. The fundamental reform of social work training recommended by Sir Martin sits alongside our existing reform programme in children’s social work: a swifter and surer adoption system, sharper intervention in inadequate authorities, diversification in delivery, and an innovation programme to encourage a wider range of partners, greater creativity, and more intelligent and supportive practice systems. What we would want for our own children, we should aim to deliver for all children. Copies of Sir Martin’s report will be placed in both House libraries."

/government/news/primary-schools-continue-to-forge-ahead-says-ofsted,"The gap in performance between primary schools and secondary schools in England is widening, the Chief Inspector of Ofsted said today. Launching his third Annual Report , Sir Michael Wilshaw said that primary school standards are continuing on an impressive upward trajectory – with more than eight in ten schools now rated at least good. The overall rate of improvement in secondary schools, however, has stalled. A similar number of secondary schools inspected over the last 12 months improved as declined – while over 50 more secondaries are now in special measures than was the case a year ago. During the same period, teaching in the further education sector has improved but too many college courses are still not equipping learners with the skills that employers want and the economy needs. Today’s Annual Report is underpinned by the findings of more than 7,000 inspections carried out during 2013/14 of schools, colleges and further education and skills providers. Separate reports dedicated to the children’s social care and early years sectors will be published in the coming months. The report finds that 82% of primary schools are now good or outstanding (up from 78% a year ago) while the overall proportion of good or outstanding secondary schools remains unchanged from last year at 71%. There are now 700,000 more pupils attending a good or outstanding primary school than in 2012. A higher proportion of secondary schools than primary schools are outstanding, 113 schools achieving Ofsted’s highest grade in the last year alone. On the other hand, more than 170,000 pupils are now in secondary schools rated inadequate, an increase of around 70,000 from two years ago. And there are 13 local authority areas of the country where children have a less than 50% chance of attending a good or outstanding secondary school. Sir Michael said more primary schools are improving because they attend to the basics, including: improving the quality of leadership effective governance teaching focused on getting the basics right, including phonics good attendance and behaviour enabling the more able pupils to reach their potential narrowing the gap between those on free school meals and other pupils In secondary schools where improvement has stalled, or standards have declined, inspectors identified the following common characteristics: teaching at Key Stage 3 (11 to 14) failing to build on prior learning poor and inconsistent leadership ineffective middle management too much low-level disruption the most able not being challenged a failure to narrow the gap for disadvantaged pupils weak governance and oversight. The proportion of further education and skills providers that are good or outstanding has increased to 81% from 72% in 2013. However, today’s report says that in order to improve the quality and status of vocational training in England, a number of issues need to be addressed, including: poor careers guidance young people not having the right skills and attitudes weak teaching in the FE and skills sector in English and mathematics a lack of employer involvement Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector, Sir Michael Wilshaw, said: This time last year, I was able to point to unmistakable signs that England’s school system was improving. This year, I am reporting that primary schools are continuing on an upward trajectory. Many secondary schools are also doing a superb job, where leadership is excellent, teaching is inspirational and the ethos fosters a learning culture. However, weaker secondary schools are not improving at the same rate as their primary school counterparts and too many are declining. I believe the time has now come to move away from the debate that has raged for the past five years about school structures and towards a sharper focus on what works in all schools, regardless of their model or status. The essential ingredients for success are no secret and have been well documented from time immemorial strong leadership, a positive and orderly culture, good teaching and robust assessment systems. Sir Michael said that in an increasingly autonomous education system where schools have greater freedom to innovate and raise standards, the importance of effective oversight was greater than ever. He voiced concern that a number of local authorities and a number of rapidly expanding multi-academy trusts were failing to provide the necessary challenge, support and intervention to their constituent schools. He also questioned whether the necessary challenge, support and intervention had been put in place quickly enough in the small proportion of cases where converter academies that are not part of any multi-academy trust declined in performance from their previous inspection. Sir Michael said he was encouraged by the rising quality of new teaching recruits and the high standards of initial teacher training in England but was becoming increasingly concerned about the declining numbers joining the profession and their uneven distribution across the country. He said: This is a pressing issue. More teachers will be needed to match the substantial increase in the number of school-aged children expected over the next 10 years. We also face a major challenge getting the best teachers into the right schools. Good and outstanding schools with the opportunity to cherry pick the best trainees may further exacerbate the stark differences in local and regional performance. The nation must avoid a polarised education system where good schools get better at the expense of weaker schools. Notes to editors The Ofsted Annual Report 2013/14 is available online.

/government/news/92000-2-year-olds-already-receiving-free-childcare,"Around 92,000 of the most disadvantaged 2-year-olds are now receiving up to 15 hours a week of fully funded childcare - just weeks after free pre-school education for these children was introduced. The Deputy Prime Minister, Nick Clegg, and Education and Childcare Minister, Elizabeth Truss, welcomed today’s figures which show that after just 1 month of this year’s scheme being launched, an estimated 70% of the identified 130,000 children are already benefitting from the scheme - a huge increase on the 20,000 children accessing free early education in 2010. Evidence shows that 2-year-olds in good and outstanding places - including nurseries, school nursery classes, and childminders - see real benefits in terms of their early language skills, and physical, social and emotional development. Parents can also be confident in the knowledge that their children are receiving high quality care which will benefit them in later life. Yet access to early education remains unequal, with children from low income families far less likely to receive high-quality learning despite research showing that they stand to benefit the most. The government wants to see more eligible 2-year-olds in high-quality early education, and has committed to providing funding for 130,000 2-year-olds to access free places from September this year - increasing to 260,000 from next September. This offer is backed up by over half a billion pounds of government funding this year, rising to £760 million in 2014 to 2015. Elizabeth Truss has called on local authorities to pass on the money in full to good and outstanding providers so that as many children as possible are able to access places, and to ensure that high quality staff are recruited and retained - particularly in the most deprived communities. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said: A child’s future can too often be decided even before they hang their coat on a peg on the first day of primary school. Early access to high-quality childcare is vitally important to ensure children are ready for school, ready for the world and able to get a good start in life. Giving disadvantaged children early support gives them the best possible chance to succeed, it means they’re less likely to fall behind their wealthier classmates and it can make a huge impact on their future. It is vital for a fair and prosperous society. This funding has meant that just 1 month in, 92,000 eligible 2-year-olds are already benefitting from support and learning that can help shape their future. Education and Childcare Minister Elizabeth Truss said: We know that high-quality early education can make a positive contribution to a child’s future success, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds. After just 4 weeks, it is fantastic to see that 92,000 2-year-olds are now benefitting from these places. Research shows that a third of children are starting school without basic language and communication skills. In poorer areas, this rises to more than a half. Good quality teacher-led early years education helps children develop the social skills and vocabulary they need for learning, and as Baroness Morgan has pointed out, school nurseries can offer these places as well as childminders and nurseries. In future, funding to councils will be based on a ‘use it or lose it’ basis. The number of participating children will determine the amount of funding they get. Where parents are not taking up these places, local authorities will get less money. Parents are able to check whether their child is eligible by contacting their local authority, provider or children’s centre. Ofsted has also developed an online tool which allows parents and providers to compare how many good and outstanding providers there are in each local area . In addition, parents and providers will know whether the full allocations have been passed on as the department will publish details of local authority spend on its website. Notes to editor Details of the funding breakdown for the 2-year-old early education programme for lower income households in 2013 to 2014. There is strong evidence that early education makes a positive difference to young children. The ‘Effective provision of pre-school education’ study found that high-quality early education has particularly strong impacts on the cognitive and social development of disadvantaged children, and that these benefits last throughout primary school. The ‘Early education pilot for 2-year-old children evaluation’ also found that only higher quality providers made an impact on children’s development in the pilot. See Ofsted’s tool which allows parents and providers to see good and outstanding nurseries and childminders in their area . The programme to provide fully-funded early education to 130,000 of the most disadvantaged children was officially launched on 1 September 2013. The figures published today were collected just a month after introduction of the programme. The number of children eligible for a funded place will double to around 260,000 from 1 September 2014.

/government/news/free-childcare-extended-to-working-families-on-low-incomes,"The Deputy Prime Minister has announced how free childcare for 2-year-olds is being doubled so that 40% of families will benefit from Britain becoming a place fit for modern working families. Read ‘Making Britain fit for modern families: speech by Nick Clegg’. From today, 130,000 2-year-olds from some of the poorest families are eligible for free childcare, based on whether their family qualifies for free school meals or whether they are looked after by the local authority. That is 20% of 2-year-olds. Next September, the number of 2-year-olds qualifying for free childcare will be doubled to 260,000 (40% of 2-year-olds), by opening up the offer to families that earn less than £16,190 per year and receive Working Tax Credits. Those who have been adopted, are in care or have a disability or special educational needs will also benefit from next year. Local authorities and providers: read more about early education for two-year-olds Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said: “From today, if you’re a parent on a low income with a 2-year-old in the family you’ll qualify for up to 15 hours a week of free early education for your child. This free support is focused on helping the families that need it most. That’s around 130,000 2-year-olds – one in every five 2-year-olds. “And from this time next year, we will extend that helping hand even further, doubling the number of youngsters getting a brighter start in life. “All the evidence shows that if you take two children – two 5-year-olds hanging up their coats next to each other on the first day of school – the poorer child will already be behind their better off classmate before a single lesson has been taught. “Without this help, children suffer and the whole class suffers as teachers have to focus more of their efforts on children who are frustrated and left behind through no fault of their own. “I believe that every British family, whatever its structure, background and circumstances should be able to get on in life.” The government is investing £534 million this year to provide childcare for 130,000 2-year-olds from this week, and this will rise to £760 million in 2014 to 2015 to help the next 130,000 2-year-olds to get a better start in life. Other measures to make Britain fit for modern families include: raising the personal allowance on income tax so that from April next year, basic rate tax payers will get to keep all of the first £10,000 they earn; this is worth around £700 a year for more than 20 million people tax-free childcare from 2015 where both parents are working but earning less than £150,000 each, the government will provide 20% of childcare costs – equivalent to £1,200 of support per child per year increase in childcare contributions from 70% to 85% by the government from 2016, so that lone parents or couples in work who pay income tax and receive Universal Credit to help pay for childcare will see reduced costs – benefiting 200,000 families more flexible parental leave by 2015, so parents can share leave between them by 2014, every employee will have the right to request flexible working Parents can check whether they are eligible by contacting their local authority or children’s centre."

The Ofsted rating of satisfactory is replaced with requires improvement to make it clear that anything less than good is not good enough for young children. The revised inspection framework details what an early years provider has to do to be rated outstanding or good. Nurseries and pre-schools judged to require improvement will be subject to monitoring within six months and re-inspected within 12 months. They will have two years to get to good – otherwise they will face the prospect of being judged inadequate. Inadequate settings will be re-inspected within six months rather than the current 12 as part of a drive to give young children, particularly those from poorer backgrounds, the best start in life. There were more than 2,500 responses to Ofsted’s consultation Good early years provision for all. Comments from professionals, parents and carers underpin the revised inspection arrangements. Sue Gregory, Ofsted Director of Early Years, said: Young children deserve the very best start in life and inspection can be a catalyst for improvement. Very many nurseries, pre-schools and childminders provide a good or better service, but we want to help others to become good through our inspections. Our revised framework will give further reassurance to parents, and give the early years sector the opportunity to demonstrate that they are providing a high quality service in which young children can develop in a safe environment.

New tests and frameworks for teacher assessment have been introduced to reflect the new curriculum. Levels have been removed and each pupil will now be given a scaled score outcome. In July 2015 we published guidance on scaled scores which made clear we won’t set the standards on the new tests until pupils have taken them and tests have been marked. In previous years, headteachers and parents always had last year’s results to benchmark their performance against in advance of the national statistics publication in late August. In order to help headteachers and parents set the results in context, I was asked to consider whether results could be published any earlier to provide more context to this year’s results. I have decided to publish the following figures at national level on 5 July 2016: the percentage of pupils in England achieving the expected standard in reading, writing and mathematics the percentage of pupils in England achieving the expected standard in reading the percentage of pupils in England achieving the expected standard in writing the percentage of pupils in England achieving the expected standard in mathematics the percentage of pupils in England achieving the expected standard in grammar, punctuation and spelling average scaled score in reading average scaled score in mathematics average scaled score in grammar, punctuation and spelling I will confirm the exact time of release closer to the time.

/government/speeches/elizabeth-truss-speaks-about-childcare-reform--2,"We live in a time of big changes: unprecedented globalisation, new technologies, and a shifting balance of global economic power. As the research of the Resolution Foundation shows, these powerful forces are changing how we work - and what we do. It’s making the link between education and earnings much stronger - because a tech-led, outward-facing economy rewards the highly-skilled. The OECD , for example, says that the association between education scores and GDP growth increased by a third from 1960 to 1980 and 1980 to 2000. And the pay and prospects of families are changing, too. Across the developed world, it has become the norm for both parents to work. In 60% of 2-parent families in the OECD , both parents work. And the concept of work itself is changing - becoming more flexible. People change jobs more often - and mums and dads use different combinations of work - sometimes holding down 2 or more jobs. Day in day out, they’re taking decisions about how they structure work - while also raising happy, successful children. For anyone that’s ever rushed home from a meeting to the school gates, or sat down to work out how to balance family time and family bills - they’ll know that this often feels like a challenge. But I think these conditions present an opportunity. Because a changing economy means that parents need affordable, available childcare more than ever. A changing world means that children need a rigorous, rounded education more than ever. The opportunity is to join those 2 things together - so that we achieve both. The opportunity Get it right, and we help parents - and give children a good start in life. That is the potential of an education and childcare system that works. And that’s why we’re reforming education, and reforming childcare. Longer school day Because at the moment, some children are falling behind. Since 2010, the number of children in failing schools has dropped - by a quarter of a million. But we still have a long tail of poor academic performance. And it’s not just academic performance. Whether it’s simple things like not having space to do homework - or big things like not being encouraged into core academic subjects - we have a long-term issue with low social capital - of pupils who lack the cultural knowledge or network to succeed. And for parents, we know things are often frustrating. Listen to the blogger Rebecca Allen, a researcher at the Institute of Education, talking about what happens when schools close in mid-afternoon: I am resigned to spending many afternoons each week standing at the school gate, driving my children to extra-curricular clubs, sitting reading my Twitter feed while the club is running, driving them home and preparing their tea while they watch TV. Yes, it is great for families to spend quality time together, but this doesn’t feel like good quality time to me. Some children left behind - some parents feel unsupported. This is why Michael Gove announced last week that a future Conservative government would help state schools - just like independent schools - to offer a school day 9 or 10 hours long. That extra time would help children who might otherwise slip. It would provide a safe, supervised place to do homework - and in particular, ensure everyone masters the core academic subjects - maths, English, sciences, languages, history and geography subjects that wealthier families have always encouraged their children into - and that our competitors like Germany and Poland now mandate for all children to at least 16. And at the same time, it would help all children build character, confidence and resilience. It would provide time for debating, cadets, orchestras, drama, volunteering, getting employers in to develop technical skills and get ready for the world of work - things that nurture rounded young people - activities that wealthier families often take for granted. And for parents who want to work, an extended school day makes balancing work and care much easier. Of course, some schools do it already. Like Great Yarmouth Primary School. Their school day runs from 9 to 5 for years 3 and 4, and to 6pm for years 5 to 6 - using that time to provide team sports, drama, extra maths, and supervised homework clubs. Or Bourne Abbey Church of England in Lincolnshire. They’re a converter academy, offering provision, from 7:30am to 6pm. They’re rated outstanding. They show you can expand children’s horizons, and support working parents. It’s good to see teaching leaders like Russell Hobby recognise this. As he said, the current schedule of intense periods and long breaks doesn’t necessarily work for teachers, either. He welcomed a debate over an extended school day - because it’s not about teachers being on their feet long into the evening. It’s about the fact that we have school buildings across the country, sitting empty for hours of each day. The fact that children need a broad, rounded education - which too many are currently denied. The fact that parents struggle to do the school to care run. It’s about seeing results for children and support for parents as part of the same question. So we’re making it easier for schools So today, I am delighted to announce sweeping reform of the regulations around the school day and childcare. We publish our response to a consultation , outlining plans for a simplification and improvement of the rules. And that will make it easier for schools to offer a longer school day. At the moment, if they want to bring in an external provider to run on-site care, they have to do new registrations. If they want to offer extensions of the school day, they have to struggle through a different set of staffing rules, different qualification rules, local consultations, and local authority permissions. So we’re making the staffing requirements for out-of-hours the same - so that the school doesn’t need to worry about changing the numbers of staff, just because the clock’s struck 4. We’re improving the child development guidance, so they don’t need to worry about meeting unnecessary rules about pedagogy and instruction. And we’re removing unnecessary central rules around setting up after school clubs - so if they want to bring in an external childcare provider, they don’t have to worry about a pile of new paperwork. Childcare outside schools And we also want to makes it easier for the childcare around the school day, too. At the moment, for example, childminders can’t operate outside homes. So in future, they’ll be able to. If schools want to bring them in, they can just do it. And at the moment, parents aren’t allowed to pay a neighbour, or relative, if they want them to look after their children for more than 2 hours - unless they register with Ofsted. That’s just daft - especially when the gap between school finishing and work ending is more or less 2 hours exactly. So the plans released today make it easier, increasing the time they can rely on informal care from 2 to 3 hours. So a longer school day; making it easier for schools to offer childcare; more sensible regulations. All of these things help parents. Whatever combination of work and care is right for them - they should feel confident there’s an option. Quality in childcare We are also improving childcare for the under 5s - as well as raising the quality of provision. All the evidence suggests once an attainment gap opens up, it’s hard to close later in life. At the moment, by the time they start school, poorer children are a full 18 months behind their richer peers in vocabulary development. It would be better to think about preventing the gap in the first place. That requires high-quality staff and pedagogy suited to the age of the child. The psychologist Daniel Willingham notes that it’s not a simple choice between academic or fun activities. Often, they’re the same thing. As he says: Songs and rhyming games…help children hear that words are composed of individual sounds, making it easier to learn how to read letters. Kids gain knowledge about the world - important for reading comprehension in later elementary years - when they are read to. Jigsaw puzzles and globes help kids develop spatial skills, which later help with math. Household rules teach children to learn to control their impulses, part of learning self-discipline. And these activities need teachers to lead them. Already, we’ve seen a 25% increase in the number of early years teachers recruited, when you compare September 2012 to 2013. We’ve introduced English and maths requirements, so that staff are themselves confident and have reached a minimum standard. But we should also think about how providers structure their operation, too. If they’re ambitious and smart, they can spend less money on overheads, make better use of their buildings, drive up their occupancy rates. Meaning there’s more money to spend on high-quality staff. And we know that containing costs doesn’t have to mean low quality. We know that other countries, like France or Germany, have excellent systems, for comparable amounts of government spending - while also paying staff good salaries and keeping parents’ costs affordable. School nurseries And we’re seeing it happen in England, too. There are some great school nurseries out there. That are open 8 to 6. That offer affordable care. And that deliver outstanding quality. Take schools like St Bede Primary Academy or Parbold Douglas Academy, in the North West. They are rated outstanding by Ofsted. They use highly qualified staff. And because they’re smart about their sessions, their staffing and their costs - it only costs these schools about £6,000 a year to provide each place. Direct comparisons are difficult, but average for the North West as a whole is something like £9,000. So not only do these schools help children: they help parents. We want more school nurseries to have similar ambitions. That’s why we are providing an £8 million fund to London local authorities - where costs are particularly acute - to extend their opening hours. We’re working with 49 different schools as they offer places for 2-year-olds - seeing what works for their pupils and parents, and how school premises can be used to offer nursery places And just imagine if all school nurseries opened longer. About two-fifths of all places provided in London are in school nurseries. Across the country, some 30% of all childcare is in school nurseries. If they all went from 9 to 3 to 8 to 6 - that’s over a 60% increase in childcare hours at school nurseries. Private nurseries and chains And it’s not just school nurseries we want to see expand. We’re backing high-quality private nurseries and chains, too. We’re ending planning restrictions - so they can convert buildings without extra bureaucracy. We’re simplifying funding - so that good or outstanding providers automatically get money. And in the reforms announced today, we’re removing unnecessary bureaucracy and red tape - allowing providers to register multiple premises in one go. All of that makes it easier for the best nurseries to grow - which in turn, makes it easier to provide quality care, and keep bills for parents low. Of course, private providers have some extra costs, like VAT . But it can be done. Like Cedar Road nursery, in Northamptonshire, that I visited last week. I saw children toasting marshmallows by a campfire - learning and having fun. The local MP Michael Ellis and I were shown around by the Director, Tom Shea - and we were served some play dough ice creams, children learning counting and gross motor skills. Their staff are well-trained, and well-paid. It’s rated outstanding. But what was really impressive was that they used their resources so well. They had 150 children on their books. They had reduced paperwork and recording to spend more time interacting with the children. And they had a capable manager - who could justify the progress children were making to Ofsted, without needing daily or weekly notes. Childminders If we look at childminders, we can see similar issues. Many are low-paid. Many struggle to fill their hours. Many have high costs for things like marketing or buying equipment - an average of £3,600 per year. We know that we have fewer younger childminders entering the profession - and it costs about £800 just to become a childminder. So we’re helping by first, simplifying funding - so that any good or outstanding childminder automatically gets access to funding to provide free early education. And second, we’re helping establish childminder agencies. So that the admin burden - marketing, accountancy, equipment, training, registration - is shared, so childminders spend less time on paperwork, and can concentrate on what they want to do - look after children. About 20 organisations are trialling the agency model. We have schools, private enterprises, local authorities and a children’s centre - working out how they can help childminders, and meet parent’s needs in their local area. Because we want more good childminders - both independent and agency. Whole market working together But crucially - whether it’s schools, private providers, nurseries or childminders - we want the system to work as a whole. In schools, one of the big lessons of academy trusts and school chains is that they can drive up standards faster - by sharing resources, and learning quickly from each other, and stronger schools lending help to weaker. By encouraging chains and expansion in nurseries and school nurseries, I hope we see the same pattern in early years. And we want all providers to work together. So our rules move us towards a system that is much clearer and more coherent. In registration - it makes no sense to have 3 separate, overlapping safeguarding requirements - so that childcare workers have to spend time working out which requirements apply to which registers. So we want to make it simpler - with 1 set of aligned requirements. In inspection, it makes little sense to have different requirements and rules for different providers. So we want to make it simpler - with a much more coherent, flexible inspection framework. Because we think of education as 1 system - and will work further with the National College of Teaching and Leadership and Ofsted towards a system where from 2 to 18, teachers have the same respect, the rules are equally clear, quality is equally valued, and parents are equally supported. Parents survey Things are moving in the right direction. Last month we published our annual survey of parents. Those parents told us that hourly costs for nurseries were about 6% lower in 2012 to 2013 than 2011 to 2012 - and childminders, about 11%. It showed that low-income parents were accessing more childcare by 16%. And it showed that maternal employment had gone up. And other surveys are encouraging, too - like the National Day Nurseries Association which showed more than half their members had frozen fees - or the recent study by Laing & Buisson finding that there has been no real growth in costs for the second year running. That’s good - but we are not complacent. And our reforms aim to secure and advance these positive numbers. Our vision Because as I said when I started - the world is changing. Families are feeling the impact of a growing, changing economy. We want the highest of expectations for early years education. We want schools that excel at academic performance and also give confidence and resilience. We want education and childcare providers that respond to the modern world, and the way families live. We want a system where not only can parents chose the life they want - get the balance of work and care that’s right for them - but can be confident their children are getting a rich, broad and effective education. Support for parents, and a good education for children. That’s the opportunity - and that’s what our reforms aim to achieve. Thank you."

Following the decision to end the wasteful BSF programme there will be enough funding to meet demographic pressures and to address maintenance needs. The independent review of education capital will ensure that the Department for Education’s capital budget is allocated in the most cost-effective way and targeted where there is most need. Over the Spending Review period there will be a total of £15.8 billion of capital spending. The average annual capital budget will be higher than the average annual capital budget in the 1997-98 to 2004-05 period. We have had to prioritise in order to ensure that funding is maintained on frontline services that are critical to helping us build a world-class education system, and we are determined to protect the most vulnerable children and young people in society. We are therefore streamlining our funding grants to generate better value for money but ensuring that targeted support remains available to those who need it most. For instance, we are: Ending Education Maintenance Allowances, which have deadweight costs of around 90%, saving £0.5 billion, and replacing them with targeted support for those who face genuine financial barriers to participation; As we move towards full participation by 2015 we will secure reduction in individual unit costs; Within the schools budget, procurement and back office savings will allow at least £1.0 billion to be invested directly on frontline teaching while the public sector pay freeze will free up an additional £1.1 billion; Ending and rationalising a range of centrally directed programmes and instead streamlining funding for the most vulnerable children and families in a new Early Intervention Grant to ensure local authorities have greater flexibility. To ensure funds are rightly prioritised on frontline education and children’s services, we are committed to making a 33% reduction in real terms by 2014-15 from the Department’s administrative budget. This will be achieved by closing NDPBs, reducing headcount, reducing the costs of the DfE estate and cutting non-essential expenditure. In addition, the Department for Education will be adopting ideas suggested through the Spending Challenge process to improve efficiency across Whitehall. These include selling surplus Government equipment through an online e-auction site, and working with the Efficiency and Reform Group to cut costs by centralising the Department’s procurement of commonly used goods and services. The Department has a number of next steps in order to set out how the school system and children’s services will be reformed and how the education spending settlement will be spent. These include a Schools’ White Paper, a Special Educational Needs and Disability Green paper, further announcements about allocating voluntary sector grants, and confirmation of LA allocations for schools and early years provision. We will announce further programmes and further bureaucracy we intend to end in the next three months. Secretary of State, Michael Gove said: The size of the deficit means we have had to make tough decisions. There will be many savings across the Department but the Coalition Government is committed to improving education for all. That’s why we’re protecting the frontline, handing power to teachers and introducing a pupil premium for the poorest.

/government/speeches/sam-gyimah-integrated-review-a-big-development,"Good morning ladies and gentlemen. It’s great to be here today (10 March 2015), and to see such a great turnout. I’ve become very familiar with 4Children and all your fantastic work. I know that whenever I spot your logo, there’ll be something innovative and exciting going on - even if it’s criticizing the work of the DfE ! I’d like to take this opportunity to congratulate, and welcome, Imelda Redman to her post. It is an exciting challenge after Anne Longfield, and as a department we look forward to continuing our strategic partnership with 4Children - and working to give every child the best start in life. And I wanted to congratulate Ted’s Meluish’s new work on evaluating children’s development and the quality of early years provision. This is shaping our understanding of what children should be achieving and when - and highlighting the good value for money that early years investment offers. All of us here know it, but we need everyone else, outside of the sector, to realise it too. But as a new parent, going through it all for the first time, I know just how important the right knowledge and support is in building your confidence and supporting your child as best as you can. But with the right helping hand, and access to the best services, getting through those early years becomes a little bit easier in today’s time-pressured world. I am proud that this government has put parents at the heart of all our early years work. We’ve helped them not just understand their child’s progress, but how to best meet their early development needs. Pupil premium In this context, the ground-breaking early years pupil premium ( EYPP ) will, as I’m sure you all know, be introduced across England from the beginning of April. It is a substantial - and essential - pool of money to help every child fulfil their potential. I want to thank 4Childen for working so closely with the rest of the sector to identify good practice, and how the premium should be used. The launch of the Education Endowment Foundation’s ( EEF ) toolkit will become an invaluable resource for providers that want to get the most out of the premium. This money is the first step in making sure that all disadvantaged children achieve just much as their peers - and in giving children the best possible start in life. But I believe we have to go even further than the premium in making sure that the impact of the early year’s workforce - those delivering life-changing services to families day in day out - is more influential than ever before. Teaching schools That is why we have focused on teaching schools. By channelling £5 million of government funding into partnering teaching schools with local nurseries, we will improve both the quality of the workforce and sharing of best practice. These are 2-way relationships, with the schools learning from early years settings and vice versa, and making those short years of early learning really count. Sheringham Nursery School and Children’s Centre in Newham has just been granted national teaching school status - a fantastic achievement for staff there. It demonstrates the important role early years settings have in making improvements across the sector. And young people in Newham now stand even an greater chance of fulfilling their potential. We want to see teaching schools, nursery schools, children’s centres and outstanding early years providers working with weaker settings to support their improvement. When it comes to spreading best practice - and I genuinely think there is best practice in every part of the sector - children’s centres, nurseries and teaching schools are all doing excellent work - and we want all of them to share and lead the sector in improvement. Integrated check Of course, to deliver improvement one of the most important partnerships for those crucial early years is between health and education - and making sure these 2 sectors talk to one another. The health visiting programme has invested in more health visitors to improve outcomes for children and families. So, in providing that all important update to parents on their child’s progress, we piloted the integrated review, bringing together health check and EYFS progress check. This is a big development. The pilots were a success, demonstrating to the authorities that took part the money, time and effort they could save with these checks - as well as a positive response from parents, who preferred the new streamlined approach and the advice provided. So, if, for example, your child is a little behind in language development, this can be identified as early as possible, and where necessary, support put in place for them. One of things I realised when I joined the department is that, although the government thinks in silos: parents don’t think in terms of how government departments work parents think about the solution to helping their children Speaking to a close friend about government support, I said you can claim something from education, something else from the treasury. And he said, “Why do I have to think that way?” That is something the integrated review will do - break down the barriers and respond to parents in a way that is more solution-focused. Equally, though, parents will learn about their child’s strengths, and how well they are progressing in all areas of social, emotional and physical development. We recently announced, with the Department for Health, that we want these rolled out everywhere from September this year. I am pleased to say today that over £2 million of funding is being made available to help local authorities meet this deadline and work more closely with their partners. So, to those who say we are not investing in the early years, we are continuing to invest in the early years. Local authorities should look to their children’s centres - non-stigmatising hubs of trusted information and support - as accessible local venues. The most innovative centres already offer birth registrations, health visitor appointments and breast feeding support. They will be excellently placed to offer the review. For example, in Bristol I have heard about the way that children’s centres are at the centre of delivering and hosting integrated reviews for disadvantaged children. We want every parent to get a rounded picture of their child’s development, with input from professionals at the relevant stage to guide them towards a happy and thriving school life. But if your 2-year-old is not in a formal childcare place, you stand, at the moment, to miss out on getting valuable input from an early years practitioner. To even out the interactions that all parents have, we have put £300k of funding, in addition to the £2 million, towards developing a joined-up review for children who aren’t in formal settings. That those young people who are cared for by grandma, other family members or their nanny, will also get the integrated check. These new pilots will test and evaluate how this will work best for parents and strike a fair balance for children in formal and non-formal settings. There will be multiple ways to access the review, because no two families are the same. Even if that is not the same lengthy review as a formal childcare setting, it is better than no review at all. Our ultimate ambition is to offer a snapshot of every 2-year-old child, everywhere, because regardless of their childcare setting, every family wants the best for their child as they progress. New parents guide Of course, these reviews are voluntary, but by utilising the expertise of the sector, and evening out parents’ access to it, we are going even further in ensuring that no parent is left in the dark over their child’s progress. With that in mind, we have developed, with 4Children, a ‘what to expect when’ guide - walking parents through the sometimes overwhelming journey of child development. One of the things I appreciated most when my wife was expecting were the emails and texts at different stages of pregnancy in terms of what to expect. And there are lots of apps telling you what you should expect your 10-month-old to be doing - but couched in careful language so not to make parents paranoid if their child isn’t there yet. The parents guide provides you, as a parent, with the empowering knowledge of how your child is developing. The accessible information plots where your child is likely to be against the early years foundation stage early learning goals - which feedback from parents tells us has been a great help. Conclusion Crucially, with the funding and the guidance, published by great organisations like 4Children and the Education Endowment Foundation, I think we can safely say that we have the ingredients needed for innovation to flourish. But, the most important ingredient is you - the people in this room. The childcare providers, nursery owners, early years educators and health professionals - all of whom know their jobs inside out, and get out of bed every morning with the sole motivation of improving life for the children in their care. That innovation we need - in joining teaching schools with nurseries, utilising the expertise in children’s centres, and widening access to crucial checks - will come from all of you. Our ambition, for a properly integrated review, easily accessed by all parents, no matter their childcare or early education choices won’t work if you’re not involved every step of the way. So, tell us your ideas, opinions or concerns. I want to hear from you. And I’ll always listen - that’s something I’ve said since I became a minister, and I hope I’ve stuck to it so far. On that note, I look forward to seeing your continued success, to see our plans for the integrated review become a reality, and celebrating what I’m sure will be a great deal of future success in the sector. Thank you."
/government/news/parents-to-get-complete-picture-of-childs-development,"Parents will have a better picture of their child’s progress at age 2 thanks to reforms including a move to bring together health and education reviews for the first time. The government today (10 March 2015) announced funding of £2.2 million for local authorities to implement their ‘integrated review’, bringing together assessments given by the Department for Education and the Department of Health. Currently, health and early years reviews of young children are carried out separately. By integrating them, parents will get a more complete picture of their child, drawing on the expertise of health visitors and early years practitioners. It has also been announced today that reviews will also be available for 2-year-olds not in settings for the first time thanks to pilots exploring how they can be offered to all children. It is hoped the pilots will find a way to reach around 275,000 children who are not in early education settings. The final part of today’s package helping parents review their children’s progress is a guide for parents on development during the first 5 years. Parents will be able to check their children’s physical, social and language development against these milestones and learn how best to support them in their development thanks to the ‘What to expect when’ handbook produced by the Department for Education and 4Children. Childcare Minister Sam Gyimah said: No parent should be left in the dark about their child’s development. There should be an accessible check for all at the age of 2, which is a pressure point where issues such as speech delay and behavioural problems begin to appear. Today’s announcement will mean more families can get valuable information in a more convenient way Health Minister Dr Dan Poulter said: We know it’s important to check children’s health and development when they are 2, so that if extra support is needed it can be identified early. Integrated reviews and the huge increase in health visitors will lead to better outcomes for children and families. The integrated review, which will be implemented nationally from September, will be available to children between 24 and 30 months old. It will bring together the assessments given to 2-year-olds through the Department of Health’s Healthy Child Programme and the Department for Education’s early years progress check. Health and early years professionals will share information and may carry out the reviews together – giving parents a better picture of their child’s progress and reducing duplication. The joined-up approach was trialled for 2 years in 10 local authorities and the new approach received strongly positive feedback from parents. Notes to editors The pilot areas that will trial reviews for children not in education settings have not yet been announced. Go to the Foundation Years website to read the ‘ What to expect when ’ guide. Integrated reviews will mean bringing together the Healthy Child Programme review at 2 to 2-and-a-half years old and the early years progress check at age 2 years. The integrated review pilot phase ran for 2 years between 2012 and 2013 in 10 locations. The 2012 to 2013 Parents Survey estimated that 48% of 2-year-olds are not in formal childcare. Since the 2-year-old entitlement has been rolled out the percentage is estimated at 40%. Given that there are around 687,500 2-year-olds in England, it is estimated that around 275,000 are not in an early education setting. Read the ‘ Integrated review at age 2: implementation study ’ report. The National Children’s Bureau has published 2 further documents which will help local areas prepare for implementation of the integrated review by September 2015. The Early Intervention Foundation has published the ‘ Getting it right for families: review of integrated systems and promising practice in early years ’ which has been welcomed by government.

/government/speeches/sarah-teather-speaks-to-the-daycare-trust,"Thank you very much for inviting me to address your conference. It’s a great pleasure to be here and to see quite a lot of familiar faces. You probably heard me speak recently at other events, I recognise quite a few people here. Can I begin by saying a huge thank you to Anand and the Daycare Trust for all the work you have done in supporting policy development over the last twelve to eighteen months. We’re hugely grateful for your input on many areas and we really do appreciate it. Some very expert, very specific, and we’re very grateful to you for the time you make to do that with us. The everyday practice of what happens in early years and childcare settings transforms and changes lives. Now I’m going to pause and say it again. The everyday practice of what happens in childcare and early years settings transforms and changes lives. Now if you’re here and you work face to face with children you will know that, because you will know that on a day-to-day basis you will have that privilege of watching children grow before your eyes, and develop and change with the input you give. You know that that is true. And if you’re a policy-maker, who works behind the scenes in early years, you also know what happens really does set the future for our country. Because there is no other time that children grow as quickly, or develop as fast, or learn as much in a way that at no other stage in our lives, as we grow up, as we become adults, there’s no other time when we absorb as much information as in those first few years. So the foundation, if you like what you do, is that foundation on which everything else is built. You build, for the long-term. Your work is not short-term. It’s measured in its impact in years, sometimes decades. Not in months, not in weeks. Many other areas in policy-making, you see those impacts very quickly. But in this area it takes a long, long time before that work is really seen, and before we can actually see whether or not we’ve made good decisions and the right decisions. Now I know, because I’ve met some of you before, and because many of you have spoken with my officials, I know that for some of you at the moment it’s an anxious time. There’s a lot of changes. Local authorities’ budgets are, in many areas, very tight. They are changing the way in which they’re developing things on the ground. And there are huge changes also in the NHS. And for some of you that’s a very anxious time indeed. However, although those changes might apparently bring many threats, I think they bring many opportunities as well. Now I’m speaking almost in the graveyard slot at 3pm and I imagine you’ve had presentations all day. You will have heard probably all day about the challenges. But I want to persuade you that there are enormous opportunities too. But they’re not short-term. They’re about building for the long-term. And a lot of what we’re trying to do is, again, just as the same way in which the work that you do is about long-term, it’s similarly about building for the longer term. And if we’re going to get that right, I’m going to need your help in making sure we get the detail right. I want just to say a few key areas where I’d really appreciate your input to make sure that we actually get that right for the longer term. Now the first of those is about a consultation I launched just over a week ago. Some of you may have seen the press coverage, some of you may already have been contacted about it, or seen information on the Department’s website. Let me just recap about that consultation. It’s a consultation about the free entitlement. The Government announced just over a year ago that in addition to extending the early years entitlement for three- and four-year-olds to 15 hours, that we’d offer 15 hours of early years education to all disadvantaged two-year-olds. We are providing substantial additional investment, £380 million by the end of the Comprehensive Spending Review period, in order to make sure that we can do that. Furthermore, we are legislating to make sure that it is a free entitlement - that has gone into the first two clauses of the Education Bill that’s just finishing up in the House of Lords at the moment*. But the question then is about how we distribute that, and how we make sure it really gets to the two-year-olds who need it. How we make sure they take up that offer, and how we make sure we get the quality of that right so that it’s really making the difference on the ground. It’s all very well just providing it, but we know that particularly disadvantaged two-year-olds, are most particularly sensitive to the quality of that offer. So that’s what the consultation is about. And what we’re proposing is that families who would meet the criteria for free school meals should benefit, along with all looked after children. But we also want to give local authorities the discretion to offer it to disabled children or children with special educational needs as well. Now that’s something, again, I’d very much like your views on about how to make sure that works. We’re also consulting on a basket of new measures for measuring quality - to define the criteria by which providers will be eligible to take up that offer. And we published the number of eligible two-year-olds that we expect, for each local authority, by 2013. And that’s really to help local authorities begin to plan. And I think in some areas, the numbers will be probably substantially larger than they were perhaps expecting. We hope that they will use this next 12 months to begin to plan an increase in capacity. We’re also changing the way in which local authorities have to respond and publish information about sufficiency of childcare in their area. And we hope that what we are proposing is much more sensible. Previously, local authorities were required to do a very bureaucratic assessment once every three years. But I don’t think any parent was ever able to use that information in a way that was useful. And I don’t think members on local authorities were really able to get at that information to scrutinise it and make sure that local authorities were actually providing childcare in a way that was useful. In addition to that, we are also requiring local authorities, as part of a new annual report, to make sure they look specifically at the needs of disabled children as well. I’m also the minister responsible for children with special educational needs and disabilities, and it’s an issue that is very dear to my heart indeed. And we’re very determined that we try and get this issue right. So I say to you, whether or not you work in a local authority, or whether or not you work on the frontline with children, please read the consultation and tell us what you think about it. Have we got the balance right, for example on the extra flexibility we’re trying to offer on the free entitlement. We’re suggesting that we might be able to offer that over two days rather than three days, with slightly longer hours. Have we got that balance right between the flexibility the parents want, and the need to prioritise child development. Look at it and tell us what you think. What’s your local authority doing to try to increase the number of places for two-year-olds? We’d really like to hear your examples. There are some fantastic examples that we’ve already seen from the pilots coming through. Tower Hamlets, despite having very cramped conditions, they’re really working well to increase the amount of capacity in their early years settings. I think you were hearing from Sutton and Merton at some point today, and similarly I know that they’re doing fantastic work in their area, again on capacity. And outside of London, Gloucestershire - really interesting work on increasing capacity. Second issue I want to raise with you is also about the workforce. This is really in response to things that many of you have said when I’ve spoken at previous conferences, and that many of you have also raised when we worked on the Families in the Foundation Years paper which we published earlier in the summer. Consistently people said to me, actually we need to think about the quality of the workforce and the training regime and the qualifications. Now, we know that the quality is substantially rising. And indeed the numbers of people working in childcare settings is also going up quite substantially - by 25% since 2006. As a Government, we are committed to continuing to fund graduate leader programmes like the Early Years Professional Status. But I’m also very aware that I think we need to do more to think about rigour and quality of training. So I say to you, what more can we do in that area? I’ve just appointed Professor Cathy Nutbrown to lead a review of workforce qualifications - and Cathy is incredibly keen to hear from you and to hear about your experience, particularly if you’ve been through the training, or are responsible for managing training for other people. We’d like to hear what your views are. This is really about planning for the long-term. These are not changes that are going to be brought out in the next few months, there’s a call for evidence happening now. But this is about planning for the next decade - these are long-term changes which we need your experience and your ability to look to the future now to make sure that we actually get that right. There will be lots of opportunities for you to do that and not just in writing. I do hope the Daycare Trust might be willing to host some workshops for us, for example, to gather evidence from many of you on what you think and feel about Cathy’s review. And the third area is around children’s centre reform and wider support for families. We have 26 areas now involved in piloting payment by results to try to move our thinking on - away from inputs and just measuring the number of children that go through centres, to make sure we’re actually measuring outcomes and really being tested about what difference we’re making to children and to families lives. We’re also setting up 16 Sure Start children’s centres teaching centres. And they’re based on the idea that some of you may have heard discussed in the Schools White Paper, that we have teaching schools - centres of excellence that really pioneer best practice and bring in all of that quality and share information. Three areas around the country are going to be piloting universal parenting classes for under 5s and we’re working very closely with the Department of Health - as they’re recruiting substantially more health visitors. I’m trying to make sure that work is really linked in with children’s centres on the ground. So I think no matter where you’re based, you’re probably quite close to somebody who is doing quite significant change and trialling something new in terms of the way in which we’re working with children’s centres. And I’m very keen to get views from the ground up about how, for example, we might involve parents better in shaping services, and making sure those services are really focused around what parents need and want in the area. Later this year we’ll be consulting on a shorter, punchier version of the statutory guidance, which will be clearer on the must dos and the should dos. So that everyone is clearer about what flexibilities they have, and are able to be, I hope, more creative on the ground. Now if you’re based in a children’s centre, or in a local authority, or another childcare setting that works closely with a Sure Start children’s centre, then please do get involved in this type of work. There are some fantastic examples on the ground of really creative practice. I’ve seen some really good examples. In fact in the last 10 days, I went to Hull and saw some very good examples of information sharing between health and children’s services. Very innovative work that I think many other areas could learn from. So if you have any examples like that, please make sure they’re fed through and people here about the good work that you do. There are lots of other things coming down the tracks, for example, the EYFS. We will be consulting again on that later in the year. We’ve responded very much to what many of you said - we’ve kept the core but made it slimmer. We hope it will drive up quality but we will need to consult again because we’re going through now the responses that many of you gave, to make sure we’re actually responding to what you said. So there is a lot more coming down the tracks and lots of things which I hope you will be involved in. As a minister, when I visit local areas and see services on the ground, you tell me two things. You tell me that first of all, it is very challenging at the moment. But you also tell me that you’re absolutely determined, no matter what the circumstances, we see substantial improvements and that we see genuine increases in quality for the children that we serve. And I think, probably because I’m a minister, when I go round, most of you show me the thing you’re most proud of. Rather than you’re main worries - though I certainly hear about your worries as well. Though sometimes it feels as though I’m the only person who gets to see the thing that you’re most proud of. And I wonder whether or not, next door, the children’s centre or the local authority or the nursery actually gets to see that fantastic example of creative practice that you do. Or whether or not that information just comes into the Department and goes somewhere on my list of examples of best practice. I say to you, my take home message - I’m sure that all of you will be doing something which is really changing the way in which you work. You’ll be doing something really interesting in your area. Please make sure that you’ve told your neighbour, or somebody on another table about what that is. Because if we’re going to genuinely change practice and genuinely drive up quality, yes it will take leadership from me, yes it will take leadership from Government, but actually mostly it will take leadership from you. Because you’re the people who are actually doing the work on the ground. Thank you very much. Ends The Bill is now an Act having received Royal Assent."
/government/news/review-to-improve-the-training-and-qualifications-for-people-working-in-the-early-years,"Nutbrown review Children’s Minister Sarah Teather has asked Professor Cathy Nutbrown, an expert in early childhood education from the University of Sheffield, to lead the review. Today Professor Nutbrown launched a call for evidence to hear from people working in the early years about the training and qualifications they think they need, and from employers, trainees, and parents. The number of people working in childcare has risen by 25 per cent since 2006. Professor Nutbrown will focus on the qualities needed to ensure that young children receive the best quality pre-school education. She will focus on improving the confidence, knowledge and skills of people who work with families on all aspects of children’s development. The review is part of a range of measures to improve early years education and childcare, especially for disadvantaged young children. Evidence shows a clear link between a high qualified, skilled early years workforce and children’s healthy development. Children’s Minister Sarah Teather said: It’s essential that people working in the early years have the right skills and training to give children the best start in life. One of the most important factors affecting a child’s healthy development is the quality of the education and childcare they receive in their earliest years. We want to make sure young children are starting school ready and able to learn. So we need to look at the training and qualifications of those working in the early years. Professor Cathy Nutbrown said: It’s vital that we have a professional, diverse and confident workforce who feel equipped to do their job well. They are often the unsung heroes of the children’s workforce - responsible for the care, education, development and wellbeing of over three million young children. I will look at how to improve the rigour and quality of current training and qualifications, and create a clear route for career progression. The review will look at: The content of early years and childcare qualifications and training courses to improve the skills, knowledge and experience of early years professionals. Career progression and motivation in the early years workforce. The development of a range of qualifications to meet the needs of all professionals, at every stage of their career. The high standards and quality that are needed to meet the needs of children, families, workers and employers in the early years sector. Raising the status of early education and childcare. The review will run until December 2011. Notes for editors The call for evidence is published in the Nutbrown review section of our website. Professor Nutbrown will be supported by an expert panel.

/government/news/disadvantaged-primary-pupils-to-benefit-from-extra-225-million,"Disadvantaged primary school pupils will benefit from an extra £22.5 million to help them close the gap on their peers, Schools Minister David Laws announced today (11 November 2014). The increased pupil premium funding for primary schools for 2015 to 2016 will provide additional resources for teachers to support the most disadvantaged pupils from the very start of school and stop them falling behind. Evidence shows that raising the attainment of pupils by the end of primary school has a direct impact on how well they go on to perform in their GCSEs , setting them on the path to a more successful future. Primary schools will now receive £1,320 for every pupil who has been registered for free school meals at any time in the last 6 years (known as ‘Ever 6 FSM ’ pupils). There has already been significant progress towards closing the attainment gap. The percentage of disadvantaged pupils meeting the expected level in both reading and maths at the end of primary has risen from 62.2% in 2011 to 69.3% in 2013, and the gap between disadvantaged pupils and others has narrowed from 18.5 percentage points in 2011 to 14.8 percentage points in 2013. The government has protected this funding as part of an ongoing commitment to providing teachers with the resources they need to continue to raise the attainment of all disadvantaged pupils, building a stronger economy and a fairer society. Schools Minister David Laws said: Every child should be able to reach their full potential, whatever their background. The pupil premium is building a fairer society with opportunity for everyone. We know schools are using their pupil premium funding more effectively than ever to raise the performance of those children who need extra help. We have already made significant progress towards closing the gap between disadvantaged pupils and their peers. This additional funding will ensure teachers continue to have the resources they need to give all pupils the best possible start at school, regardless of their background. David Laws confirmed the total available pupil premium funding will be protected in real terms, giving a total of £2.545 billion in 2015 to 2016. All secondary schools will continue to receive £935 for ‘Ever 6 FSM ’ pupils, and all schools will continue to receive £1,900 for those who are looked after or have left care through adoption or other circumstances. The government has taken significant steps to provide support at an earlier stage for disadvantaged pupils, to ensure all young children are able to fulfil their potential in life. Last month it was announced that schools, nurseries and childminders are to receive £300 for every 3- and 4-year-old from a low-income family under the new early years pupil premium, so these children start school on an equal footing to their peers. As part of a wider government commitment to raising the attainment of all pupils, David Laws today also announced that the literacy and numeracy catch-up premium for year 7 pupils will be continued in 2015 to 2016. The premium, for pupils from all backgrounds who do not reach the expected level 4 in reading or mathematics at key stage 2, enables schools to provide additional support to help them catch up with their classmates. Schools receive £500 per eligible pupil, totalling £53.8 million in 2013 to 2014. Notes to editors Actual 2015 to 2016 pupil premium allocations will be announced in June 2015. The pupil premium has increased in each year of this parliament, and will now surpass the £2.5 billion originally set out at the formation of the coalition government. Read more about the pupil premium . The government is providing a literacy and numeracy catch-up premium for year 7 pupils who have failed to reach level 4 in reading and/or mathematics - the 2 most important skills for life. Allocations for the 2014 to 2015 year 7 literacy and numeracy catch-up premium will be made in early 2015, based on the number of eligible pupils listed in autumn 2014 census returns and the 2014 key stage 2 assessments. Schools will receive an additional premium of £500 for each year 7 pupil who has not achieved at least level 4 in reading and/or mathematics (maximum £500 per pupil) at key stage 2. We expect to make 2015 to 2016 allocations in early 2016, on the same basis. More information about the year 7 literacy and numeracy catch-up premium is available. [Contact:997]"

/government/speeches/sarah-teather-to-the-national-children-and-adult-services-conference,"Thanks to NCAS. It’s a great pleasure to be here today. This is not an easy time to be in government at any level. It’s not an easy time to be in national government, and it’s not an easy time to be in local government. I am sure I speak for all Ministers in saying that we’re extremely grateful for all that you have done working with us over the last year at a time when I know that it hasn’t been easy for you. Despite challenging financial circumstances, the government is determined to stick to the principles I outlined to you last year. Our priorities are early intervention; a focus on the most disadvantaged; and we want to do that by working through principles of localism. In an ideal world I could wave a magic wand and conjure up more money. I am sure that all of you wish that you could too. But the truth is that neither of us can. You know as well as I do that the government has to tackle the deficit and we have to get the economy back onto a sound footing. It makes it an incredibly challenging time for all of us to play a leadership role. But you don’t get to choose your moment to be in government. You only get to choose how you act. It’s more important now, than at any other time, that we have very clear priorities, and that we stick to those despite the challenging circumstances in which we’re working. It would have been easier for us to have acceded to calls to reintroduce ring fencing, to tighten up targets, and to introduce more prescriptive guidance. We chose not to. We made a promise to you that we would give you more freedom and give you more power to act. Localism is something that we believe in and it is something that we’ve tried to stick to. Similarly, I imagine it would have been easier for you to have cut deeply into early intervention services. But many of you have chosen not to do that this year. Most of you have worked incredibly hard to protect frontline services. Most of you have done your best to prioritise Sure Start Children’s Centres, by merging back office functions, clustering services, because you know that this makes sense. You know that it makes sense for children, it makes sense for families and, in the long term, it makes good financial sense for you if you’re running a council. Tough times are the times when leadership comes to the fore. We know we need to give DCSs the space to fill that leadership role. We have recently issued a consultation on revised statutory guidance on the role of the DCS and Lead Member for Children’s Services. It is much shorter and much less prescriptive. It will be up to local authorities to determine their structures. It is important that we’re able to assure ourselves that we have in place the clear line of accountability that Lord Laming and Professor Munro saw as critical to the well-being and safety of children and young people. This is a question of balance, a question where we’re trying to make sure that we clearly balance our priorities with our localist principles. I would certainly encourage you to respond to the consultation. Part of leadership is about sharing knowledge with one another. There is an enormous amount that you can teach others, very much including myself. We’ve seen that clearly in the 18 authorities who are participating in trials this year to develop provision or capacity for the new entitlement for two year olds. Already some promising evidence is filtering through. For example, in Rotherham, settings have boosted the number of places they can offer through earlier opening times and stretching the offer across all weeks of the year, rather than just during term time. One setting now offers 45 places rather than 14. Similarly, we’ve seen great examples in Medway, where they’ve created a database to track the development of each child or cohort, so that children starting to fall behind are identified promptly. Examples like this are just the tip of the iceberg. I’m sure that there will be many examples in your local authority where you know that you’re really challenging practice; that you’re taking ideas forward; that you’re doing things on the ground that others could learn from. I hope that conferences like this are opportunities for you to flaunt those examples and advertise them to others to make sure that everyone is learning from the good practice that is working on the ground. We’ve been trying to tap into that ingenuity and good practice in the way in which we are developing policy. Early Years Just before the summer recess we issued a document called Families in the Foundation Years. We worked on that document in a different way: through a co-production process, working with local authority representatives and professionals from the early years to make sure we were actually developing policy from the ground up. There’s a considerable amount of work now building on that initial work that we announced in the summer. We have our consultation on Early Education and Childcare coming up. This is really important - for lead members and DCSs as well as for early years leads. It is important because it sets out proposals for which disadvantaged two-year-olds will be eligible for free early education from September 2013. We want to make sure that your teams have local discretion to fund other disadvantaged two years old who might benefit. In particular, that means children with disabilities or with special educational needs. Included in the consultation is draft guidance for the delivery of free early education for 2, 3 and 4 year olds, along with strengthened criteria for free early education places so that we have a more open process for identifying quality and promoting improvement. I think you’ll also be pleased to hear it has dropped in size from 100 pages to fewer than 20. I hope that’s good news! It’s something that we are trying to do across the piece. And do please feed in to Professor Nutbrown’s upcoming review, which will be looking at the early years workforce, something which is incredibly important and which many of you have raised with me at previous conferences. It will be formally launched at the end of this month, through a ‘call to evidence’ to the sector. We’re very keen to hear your views, so please do get involved. Payment by results is another good example of where the sector leading the way in shaping future services. Local authorities are supporting one other under the guidance of the ADCS, SOLACE and the LGA. Trials of payment by results for children’s centres have started in 26 areas. These will find ways to reward children’s centres and local authorities for improvements in outcomes, rather than inputs, with a particular focus on child development, school readiness and reducing inequalities for the most disadvantaged families. We’re looking forward to hearing what makes a difference on the ground, and what needs to change. Another critical aspect of leadership is joining up services in the interests of children. I know that this is something that you do every day in your work. It’s something that is core to what we’ve been trying to do through our Green Paper on Special Educational Needs, and the reforms that we’re taking forward. We want health services to be firmly integrated into a local offer, a single assessment process and the Education, Health and Care plan. Local authority leaders have key role in achieving this ambition. I’m grateful to those of you whose teams are currently involved in the pathfinders. We’ve already seen some very exciting ideas coming out from them, and it’s a tremendous credit to the local authorities involved. We have a lot to do to make sure that these proposals work. They’ve been developed with the ideas that have come from you and come from others over the first 18 months that we’ve been in government. A lot of work is going to be needed to hold all of those professionals’ feet to the fire, including making sure that we properly integrate that work with health, something that I know many of you feel very strongly about. I’m going to need all of your help on the ground to make sure that we develop that properly. The pilots are trying to make sure that we look through to 25; that we deal with the issues around transition that we know are so difficult. Bringing together assessments and bringing together the role of the voluntary sector. I hope that it will put children, young people and families at the heart of the process. Making sure the services they receive are not just about adults, but about the children and young people who are receiving them. There are many exciting opportunities coming up for local authorities - getting more involved in public health, for example. Tom Jeffery and David Behan are giving a presentation on this subject on Friday, and looking at issues around the new relationship with public health, something that I know many of you will be interested in. I know that this is a tough time, and I also know that it’s not going to get any easier in the short term. We both know that. But we can’t stand still in that time, no matter how difficult it may be. We have to put in place now the right changes. The right structural changes that will benefit us in the long term. Making sure that we’re clear about our priorities. Making sure that partnership working really does work. A great deal can change, even in days when money is short, by working better together. By changing how we work. By changing the way in which we learn from one another. That takes leadership. And it takes a different style of leadership. Leadership which is open - open to challenge, open to new ideas. Not necessarily ideas that were started here, but also making sure that we’re making the most of ideas that started in other places too. Let me finish by saying a huge thank you to you for all that you have done, for all the work that you’re taking forward; for all the ways that you’ve positively responded to consultations and requests that we’ve made of you for more information, detail and examples to make sure that we’re getting our policy right. I’m determined that we continue to work in that spirit, and look forward to working with you over the next twelve months."
/government/news/early-years-apprenticeship-bursary-doubled-to-3000,"Two hundred early years apprentices will benefit from an increased bursary of £3,000 - up from £1,500 - with a further £300 available for training and study as part of the government’s drive to attract high-quality candidates to the profession. The bursaries - announced in May this year - are available to those taking part in an early years apprenticeship scheme which offers a high-quality route to becoming an early years educator, the modern equivalent of the highly respected nursery nurse diploma. The first 200 successful applicants to the bursary scheme will secure the increased award of £3,000. Evidence shows that gaps in educational attainment between the most disadvantaged children and those from wealthier backgrounds are already well established before children reach school. We know that qualified and highly skilled leadership is the best way to improve outcomes for these children, by raising standards and ensuring that all young children receive the best possible start in life. In ‘ More great childcare ’, the government set out its plans to increase the number of skilled staff working in the early years, and to improve qualifications so that parents and providers have greater confidence in the calibre of people teaching young children. Elizabeth Truss, Education and Childcare Minister, said: Caring for and educating young children requires great skills and specific experience. I hope the increased bursaries announced today encourage more talented people to start a career in early education, which can be a fantastically rewarding job. Research shows that a third of children are starting school without basic language and communication skills - in poorer areas, this rises to more than a half. Knowledgeable and experienced staff, such as the new early years educators, will play a vital role in providing good quality early years education to ensure that all children - no matter what their starting point in life - develop the skills they need for learning. To be eligible, applicants will need to secure an apprenticeship position in a nursery, school nursery, or children’s centre that delivers the early learning places for 2-year-olds and hold at least a GCSE , at grade C or above, in English and maths. The scheme, which is run by the National College for Teaching and Leadership, is now open for applications. Apprenticeships are expected to take an average of 20 months to complete, and will consist of employment and study to gain recognised qualifications through various routes - including further education colleges. Notes to editors There is strong evidence that early education makes a positive difference to young children. The ‘Effective provision of pre-school education’ study found that high-quality early education has particularly strong impacts on the cognitive and social development of disadvantaged children, and that these benefits last throughout primary school. The ‘Early education pilot for 2-year-old children’ evaluation also found that only higher-quality providers made an impact on children’s development in the pilot. Successful applicants for the 200 bursaries available this financial year will receive £3,000. The main bursary payment will be subject to tax and national insurance deductions. Since September 2010, every 3- and 4-year-old has been entitled to 15 hours per week of funded early education. In September 2013, the government introduced early learning places for around 20% of all 2-year-olds. Children will be eligible if their families meet the income and benefits criteria also used for free school meals, or if they are looked after by their local authority. From September 2014, this will be increased to around 40% of 2-year-olds. The bursary scheme is administered by the National College for Teacher and Leadership. Applicants will need to be undertaking the level 3 advanced apprenticeship in children and young people’s workforce to be eligible. [Contact:997]"

/government/publications/an-outstanding-enterprising-curriculum-for-children,"This example shows how enterprise education, including the development of pupils’ financial capability and their economic and business understanding only prepares students for their future life as consumers, producers and citizens, and contributes to outstanding achievement throughout the school. Children are introduced to economic ideas in the Early Years Foundation Stage and there is progression through to Year 6."
/government/speeches/school-funding-for-2016-to-2017,"World-class schools are a vital part of the government’s long-term economic plan, and are one of the key drivers of the productive economy of the future. We are therefore committed to making school funding fairer, to maintaining the amount of money that follows children into schools and to confirming the extra £390 million fairer funding uplift from 2015 to 2016 in budgets for 2016 to 2017 and beyond. This will help every child, everywhere, to have the best possible chance to reach their potential. Today, we are taking the first steps towards meeting these commitments by publishing the per-pupil funding rates for each local authority’s schools budget for 2016 to 2017. This protects the per-pupil funding in each authority from 2015 to 2016, meeting the commitment to protect the national schools budget and to baselining the £390 million extra funding. We are also publishing the Education Funding Agency’s operational guide, to allow local authorities to start the process of consulting with their schools on how the funding should be distributed in their area. The forthcoming spending review will set out the government’s plans for the delivery and funding of public services for this Parliament. It will set out further detail on key delivery priorities for schools and local authorities and confirm funding levels for other grants and programmes. In light of the spending review and any consequent changes to the School Finance Regulations (which would of course be consulted on), the operational guide may have to be updated and local authorities may have to review the planning and modelling they have undertaken. Final funding allocations to each authority will be made in December, in line with the latest data on their pupil numbers. Baselining the 2015 to 2016 minimum funding levels in 2016 to 2017 is an important step towards making funding fairer. However it remains the case that a school in one part of the country can receive over 50% more funding than an identical school in another part of the country. I am therefore committed to making schools and early education funding fairer and will put forward proposals in due course. We recognise the links between funding for early education, schools and pupils with high-cost special educational needs. These are complex issues to consider, and we will consult extensively with the sector and the public on them."

/government/news/special-educational-needs-support-families-to-be-given-personal-budgets,"Health, education and care services legally required to work together Parents are to get a new legal right to buy in specialist special educational needs (SEN) and disabled care for their children, under plans set out today by Children’s Minister Sarah Teather. For the first time ever, parents will be given the power to control personal budgets for their children with severe, profound or multiple health and learning - meaning they can choose the expert support that is right for their child, instead of local authorities (LAs) being the sole provider. The biggest reform of SEN for 30 years will also force education, health and social care services to plan services together by law - so when their children are assessed, parents will be assured they will get full provision to address their children’s needs. Often it is not clear to parents, and to local services, who is responsible for delivering on the statement of special needs. Services such as speech and language therapy may appear in the statement but are funded and commissioned by local health services. Sarah Teather said that would stop the ‘agonising’ battle many parents fight to get the support for their families, as they are forced to go from ‘pillar to post’ between different authorities and agencies. She said it would end the delays children face by undergoing multiple check-ups over many months, sweeping away the current outdated, slow and complex system. The reforms are set out in the Government’s formal response to the public consultation on its green paper, Support and Aspiration published today. The main elements are: Replacing SEN statements and separate learning difficulty assessments (for older children) with a single, simpler birth to 25 years assessment process and education, health and care plan from 2014. Parents with the plans would have the right to a personal budget for their support. Providing statutory protections comparable to those currently associated with a statement of SEN to up to 25-years-old in further education - instead of there being a ‘cliff edge’ when it is cut off at 16, to help young people into employment and independent living. LAs and health services will be required to link up services for disabled children and young people - so they are jointly planned and commissioned. Requiring LAs to publish a local offer showing the support available to disabled children and young people and those with SEN, and their families. Introducing mediation for disputes and trialling giving children the right to appeal if they are unhappy with their support. Children would have a new legal right to seek a place at state academies and Free Schools - currently it is limited to maintained mainstream and special schools. LAs would have to name the parent’s preferred school so long it was suitable for the child. The consultation had a huge response - with around 2,400 formal responses giving broad support for the reforms. The changes are already being piloted in 20 local pathfinders. The interim evaluation reports are due in summer and late autumn this year with a final report in 2013. The Children and Families Bill announced in last week’s Queen’s Speech will now put legislation in place for the reforms. Children’s Minister Sarah Teather said: The current system is outdated and not fit for purpose. Thousands of families have had to battle for months, even years, with different agencies to get the specialist care their children need. It is unacceptable they are forced to go from pillar to post, facing agonising delays and bureaucracy to get support, therapy and equipment. These reforms will put parents in charge. We trust parents to do the right thing for their own child because they know what is best. The right to a personal budget will give them real choice and control of care, instead of councils and health services dictating how they get support. It is a huge step forward to require health, education and care services work together. The reforms will give parents better information and a comprehensive package of support that meets their needs. Christine Lenehan, Director of the Council for Disabled Children, the Government’s strategic partner on its SEN reforms, said: We are delighted that the Government continues to support disabled children and those with special educational needs. Tackling the battleground for families by ensuring joined-up local services and clear local information is to be warmly welcomed. The green paper response also confirms a £3 million supported internships trial will be launched in 15 further education colleges this autumn, for 16- to 25-year-olds with the most complex learning difficulties or disabilities; and the possibility for all colleges to offer supported internships from September 2013. The programme will provide structured study, based at an employer, which is tailored to the individual needs of the young person and will equip them with the skills they need for the workplace. This will include on-the-job training, backed by expert ‘job coaches’ to support interns and employers, and the chance to study for relevant qualifications - where appropriate. Notes to editors Today’s response and next steps document to the Support and Aspiration green paper is published The green paper was published and consulted in March 2011. The Government is piloting the reforms in 20 pathfinders, covering 31 LAs. It announced the details in September 2011. The interim evaluation will be published in autumn 2012 and final evaluation in 2013. The work of the pathfinders will continue to inform the changes we make to legislation through the Bill. The Children and Families Bill announced in the Queen’s Speech set out legislation to transform the SEN system. The Bill’s SEN provisions will apply to England. The key measures set out in today’s next steps document are: Education, health and care plans: SEN statements (for under 16s) and learning difficulty assessments (for over 16s) will be replaced with a single, integrated education, health and care plan from 2014 from birth to 25 years. This means that children, young people and families will have a single assessment process, covering education, health and care, and ensuring that families have confidence that all of the different local agencies - across education, health and social care are working to together to meet their needs. This will stop parents having to have to undergo repeated assessments with different agencies. It will end the dramatic ‘cliff edge’ young people face when they leave school at 16 or 18, losing statutory rights when SEN statements stop and triggering a completely new reassessment which carries far less protection. Personal budgets: all families with an approved education, health and care plan will have a legal right to request a personal budget, if they choose. Parents can directly buy in the support identified in the plan - currently they rely on LAs and other services to pay for services. Parents will be given a choice of whether to take control of the personal budget by agencies managing the funds on their behalf or, where appropriate, by receiving direct payments, if they are suitable, to purchase and manage the provision themselves. Joint commissioning: LAs and clinical commissioning groups would have to put arrangements in place to ensure that services for disabled children and young people, and those with SEN are planned and commissioned jointly. This would help ensure that agencies work together to agree the best package of support as well as avoiding lengthy disputes over who should pay for services. The Department of Health will, subject to consultation, use the mandate to the NHS Commissioning Board to ensure that the NHS commissioning system and, in particular, clinical commissioning groups, are focused on improved outcomes for disabled children and those with SEN. School choice: parents whose children have an education, health and care plan would have the legal right to seek a place at any state-funded school of their choice - whether maintained, academy, Free School or special. LAs would have to name the parent’s preferred school so long it was suitable for the child, did not prejudice the education of other children or did not mean an inefficient use of funds. Local offer: all LAs would publish a ‘local offer’ of support, so parents would know exactly what is available instead of having to fight for basic information. It is envisaged that all parents would be given details of: early years, school and colleges provision and transport to and from it; social care services available, including short breaks; health services, including speech and language therapy; how to access specialist support; and special and specialist school provision available - including training providers and apprenticeships. Mediation and the tribunal and children’s right to appeal to a tribunal: introducing mediation before Tribunal for disputes and trialling giving children the right to appeal if they are unhappy with their support. Ofsted reported in September 2010 that many children, particularly those in the school action category, were wrongly identified as having SEN when their needs were capable of being met from good teaching and pastoral support. We propose to introduce a new single category of SEN to make sure the right support to raise attainment is given to the right children - replace the existing complicated school action and school action plus systems and we will provide tighter guidance on which children should be identified as having SEN. To support schools we have made the highly successful Achievement for All model available to any school that wants it. 780 schools are involved in the programme and a Quality Mark has been developed and awarded to 164 schools, to recognise excellence in schools that improve outcomes for pupils who have SEN or are disabled.

/government/news/government-is-acting-to-get-children-ready-for-school,"Recent reports that children are beginning school without knowing their own name demonstrate not just the importance of good parenting, but the wider help and support that young children need in the crucial early years of their life. Experiences in the first five years of a child’s life have the biggest impact on how their brain develops. It’s when children grasp the fundamental skills they need to do well at school and develop as happy, confident individuals. The Government wants a system where every child can thrive, regardless of their social background. That’s why the Department has recently announced a series of measures to support parents and improve early years education so that children are ready and able to learn at school. A new early years curriculum for 0-5-year-olds will be introduced next year which focuses on three prime areas of learning that are critical to making sure children develop healthily and happily. It will form the foundations on which children can master the basic skills at school as well as the resilience, confidence and personal skills to be able to learn. It will also give professionals more freedom in how they work with children, and involve parents more in their child’s learning. Research shows that parental interest in their child’s education has four times more influence on attainment by age 16 than socio-economic background. Parents will get much clearer information on how their children are doing with the introduction of a new progress check for every two-year-old in early education. Parents and professionals can be confident children are developing well and any problems will be picked up early. Action the Government is taking to help parents ensure their children are school ready includes: A new focus on three prime areas of learning in the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) so children are ready and able to learn at school. These are: personal, social and emotional development, physical development and communication and language. A slimmed down EYFS, more closely aligned with Key Stage 1 to smooth the transition from reception class to Year 1. All early years settings to provide a new check for every two-year-old to pick up early any problems in a child’s development or special educational needs. Children’s centres to have a stronger focus on school readiness and supporting families. Early years qualifications are to be reviewed to make sure they are sufficiently rigorous and high quality - a highly skilled, graduate-led workforce is crucial to making sure children develop well and are ready for school. A new website, Families in the Foundation Years , sets out in one place what every mother and father need to know to help their child develop well, stay healthy and be ready for school, from pregnancy right through to when their child is five. Parents will be able to find information on ante-natal classes, flexible working and childcare in their area. [Contact:997]"

/government/news/primary-school-absence-government-adviser-calls-for-crackdown,"Publishing reception absence data to help schools intervene earlier. Overhaul of fine system for school absence to make it more effective. Strengthening of the rules around term-time holidays Extension of Charlie Taylor’s appointment as government adviser. Charlie Taylor, the government’s expert adviser on behaviour, today called for a crackdown on primary school absence to make sure it is not a problem later on in life. Latest figures show that almost 400,000 pupils miss 15% of schooling a year - the equivalent of having a month off school. Evidence shows that as children move up through the school system from primary school onwards, the number of children who are persistently absent grows - most significantly in the final years of secondary school. By the time children have reached their mid-teens it becomes more difficult for parents and schools to get them to attend. Much of the work these children miss when they are off school is never made up, leaving them at a considerable disadvantage for the remainder of their school career. The majority of children whose parents are taken to court for poor attendance are in Years 10 and 11, but by this time it is often too late to solve the attendance problems. Currently there is no nationally collected data on children’s attendance in nursery and reception, as school is not mandatory at this age. This means schools are not held to account for pupils’ attendance until they reach the age of five. Many schools do not take measures to improve attendance until their pupils reach statutory school age, but for some children this is already too late. Children with low attendance in the early years are also more likely to come from the poorest backgrounds. These children are likely to start school already behind their peers, particularly in their acquisition of language and their social development. Charlie Taylor has called for: the government to publish data on attendance in reception along with local and national averages and this is considered when Ofsted inspects primary schools analyse their data on attendance and quickly pick up on children who are developing a pattern of absence primary schools focussing on supporting parents in nursery and reception who are failing to get their children to school. Having worked in some of London’s toughest schools, Charlie Taylor was commissioned by Education Secretary Michael Gove to look at the issue of school attendance in the wake of the summer riots last year. Publishing his independent review - ‘Improving attendance at school’ - he said: School attendance has been steadily improving in the last few years, but there were still 54 million days of school missed last year. Schools are aware of the consequences of poor attendance on their pupils’ attainment. Some schools go to great lengths to tackle attendance issues, and to see the absence rates decreasing is very promising. But more work needs to be done to reduce the number of pupils who are still persistently absent. The earlier schools address poor attendance patterns, the less likely it is that they will become a long term issue. The best primary schools realise this and take a rigorous approach to poor attendance from the very start of school life. There is also clear evidence of a link between poor attendance at school and low levels of achievement. Of pupils who miss between 10% and 20% of school, only 35% achieve 5 or more GCSEs at grades A* to C including English and maths. But 73% of pupils who attend 95% of school achieve this. The government has already taken action to improve school attendance. Last year, the government lowered the threshold at which children are defined as persistently absent to 15% or more of school time, so that schools could step in to tackle absence sooner - before the problem really takes hold. Previously, children who missed 20% of school were considered persistent absentees. The main recommendations from the independent review, which the government has accepted, include: Making data on attendance in reception classes available along with local and national averages - this fits with the government’s policy of giving as much information as possible about school performance. Publishing national statistics on attendance for the whole year not just up until half term in the summer, as is currently the case. The exception to this would be for Year 11. Asking Ofsted to set specific, timed targets for improving attendance in schools where it is low. Encouraging all primary schools to analyse their data on attendance so that they can quickly pick up on children who are developing a pattern of absence including in nursery and reception. Whilst there should be no outright ban on term-time holidays and with headteachers having the discretion, the government should toughen up the rules. If children are taken away for a two week holiday every year and have an average number of days off for sickness and appointments, then by the time they leave at 16 they will have missed an entire year of their schooling. The government will in due course amend the Pupil Registration Regulations to make clear that schools should only give permission where there are exceptional circumstances. The latest figures show that term-time holidays remain a major reason for absence. Parental sanctions for school absence One of the last resorts for schools to deal with absence problems is to issue fines to parents. Currently if a headteacher decides to impose a fine, the parent has 28 days to pay a fine of £50; if they fail then it is doubled. After 42 days if the parent has not paid then the local authority has to withdraw the penalty notice, with the only further option being for local authorities to prosecute parents for the offence. More than 32,600 penalty notices for school absence were issued to parents last year, and more than 127,000 have been issued since introduction in 2004. However, around half went unpaid or were withdrawn. Whilst independent research shows that over three-quarters (79%) of local authorities said that penalty notices were ‘very successful’ or ‘fairly successful’ in improving school attendance, local authorities feel court action is often a long-winded process that achieves very little. In 2010, out of 9,147 parents found guilty by the courts, only 6,591 received a fine or a more serious sanction. The average fine imposed by the court was £165. Education Welfare Officers report that, within certain groups of parents, the word has spread that prosecution for poor attendance is a muddled process in which there is a good chance of getting off without sanction. Fines for school absence were introduced by the previous government in 2004 and the levels of the fines have not been revised since then. In comparison to other offences, the fines for school absence are relatively low: Parking fines range from £80 to £130 and if paid within 14 days it is reduced by 50%. Speeding fines are £60 if paid within 28 days plus three points added to your driving licence, after which it doubles to £120 and registered in court as a fine. Littering, graffiti and flyposting offences attract fines up to £80, reduced if paid within a certain timeframe. Charlie Taylor has recommended a toughening up of the system by increasing the fines. The government has accepted this recommendation and from September 2012, headteachers will be able to impose a fine of £60 (a £10 increase) on parents whom they consider are allowing their child to miss too much school without a valid reason. If they fail to pay within 28 days it will double to £120 (a £20 increase), to be paid within 42 days. Charlie Taylor has also recommended that once the fine has doubled, the money should be recovered automatically from child benefit. Parents who do not receive child benefit and fail to pay fines would have the money recovered through county courts. Charlie Taylor said: We know that some parents simply allow their children to miss lessons and then refuse to pay the fine. It means the penalty has no effect, and children continue to lose vital days of education they can never recover. Recouping the fines through child benefit, along with other changes to the overall system, will strengthen and simplify the system. It would give head teachers the backing they need in getting parents to play their part. The government will consider this recommendation further and work with other government departments to explore ways to make the payment of penalty notices swift and certain. Secretary of State for Education Michael Gove, responding to the report, said: We must do everything to improve school attendance so that all children benefit from good teaching. Successive governments have focussed overwhelmingly on tackling truancy amongst older children. We now need a fundamental change in approach. Improving the attendance of younger children at primary school will reduce the number who develop truancy problems when they are older. We must also equip schools to tackle the minority of parents who do not heed that message. Sanctions are most likely to work if their effect is immediate and if they are simple to administer. I agree that the current penalty notice scheme should be simplified. I will work with my colleagues in the Government to explore ways to make the payment of penalty notices swift and certain. Extension of Charlie Taylor’s appointment The Secretary of State for Education, Michael Gove, has also today extended the appointment of Charlie Taylor as the Government expert adviser on behaviour for a further year.

/government/news/new-50m-fund-to-help-most-disadvantaged-3-and-4-year-olds,"Three- and four-year-olds from low-income families are to benefit from a new £50 million fund unveiled today helping to prevent them falling behind before they have even started school. The new early years pupil premium, worth over £300 per pupil, is designed to narrow the attainment gap between young children from low-income families and their peers, setting them on the path to a more successful future. According to research, children from low-income families are estimated to already be 19 months behind more advantaged peers when they start school. High-quality early education can close this gap and improve results later on in life. The early years pupil premium aims to help nurseries raise the quality of their provision and today’s consultation will look at how best to make it work. Nurseries will have freedom to decide how to use the money to help 3- and 4-year-olds learn and develop, for example more qualified staff or specialists in activities like speech and language to give an extra focus on basic skills. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said: Every child deserves the chance to fulfil their potential, and this extra funding is a boost to help our youngest children get on in life and succeed. Boys and girls from poorer families have often already fallen 19 months behind their better off classmates by the time they hang up their coat on the first day of school. Increasing their chances of success has got to be a top priority. Education and Childcare Minister Elizabeth Truss said: Children from low income families are already behind their peers in language and communication by the age of 5 - this is not good enough. We expect nurseries will use this money to create more high-quality nursery provision led by teachers. We know it’s a challenge to close the attainment gap later on but with the introduction of the early years pupil premium we hope it will prevent this gap from emerging in the first place. The early years pupil premium builds on the pupil premium, established in 2011, to transform the way we educate our children from low-income families. Its launch coincides with today’s Pupil Premium Awards ceremony , recognising the schools in England best at helping pupils from low-income families through their effective and innovative use of the funding. The Deputy Prime Minister will congratulate the 3 winners at a ceremony in London, designed to promote the best ways of using the money so that other schools can follow their lead. Schools Minister David Laws added: The pupil premium is about helping schools to help all pupils succeed - regardless of background. The new early years pupil premium will help to capture those children who need support at an early age - bringing them on a level playing field with their peers by the time they start school. We’re also celebrating the success of the pupil premium and I want to congratulate all of the schools and their inspiring staff nominated this year and encourage them to go even further for next year’s awards. The early years pupil premium is part of the government’s programme of reforms to help children get ready to begin school, especially those who are from low-income families. This includes: expanding 15 hours of free early education to 40% of 2-year-olds expanding the role that schools play in the early years tougher inspection and accountability through a stronger Ofsted framework improving the quality of staff entering the early years workforce by introducing early years teachers encouraging new providers into the market including through the introduction of childminder agencies Background More information about the pupil premium can be found on our policy page . The early years pupil premium consultation is available online. Details on who is eligible for the early years pupil premium can be found in chapter 4 of the consultation. Award winners will be announced at 10.30am on Wednesday 25 June. [Contact:997]"
/government/news/early-years-foundation-stage-to-be-radically-slimmed-down,"Dame Clare Tickell is today recommending that the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) is radically slimmed down to make it easier to understand, less burdensome and more focused on making sure children start school ready to learn. Dame Clare Tickell on the EYFS review Setting out her recommendations, Dame Clare says that while parents and early years professionals agree that the EYFS has had a positive impact on children’s outcomes and helped to raise standards, in its current form there is far too much time spent filling in forms and not enough interacting with children. She says the EYFS needs to be simplified and made even more accessible for parents and practitioners. The current EYFS has 6 areas of learning and 69 learning goals. These goals are used to monitor children’s progress while they are in pre-school. At the age of 5 they are assessed against these goals, on a 117 point scale, as part of the EYFS profile. To reform the current framework and make it less bureaucratic, Dame Clare’s recommendations include: Significantly reducing the number of early learning goals children are assessed against at age five from 69 to 17. Parents to get a summary of their child’s development, alongside the health visitor check at age two, to help identify any early problems or special educational needs. A new focus on three prime areas which are the foundations for children’s ability to learn and develop healthily: personal, social and emotional development; communication and language; and physical development. Beneath these should be four areas of learning where these skills are applied: literacy, mathematics, expressive arts and design and understanding the world. With the three new prime areas of learning, a greater emphasis on making sure children have the basic social, emotional communication and language skills they need to learn and thrive at school - things like being able to make friends and listen effectively. There should also be a stronger link between the EYFS and what is expected of children in KS1. Freeing the workforce from unnecessary bureaucracy so they can spend more time interacting with children - including scrapping written risk assessments for nursery trips and outings. All early years practitioners to have at least a level 3 qualification (which is equivalent to A level) and the Government should consider applying the ‘teaching schools’ model to the early years. Ofsted should be clearer on what is required of settings when they are inspected to help reduce high levels of paperwork. Independent schools should be allowed to apply to opt out of the learning and development part of the EYFS, and the exemptions process should be made easier. Dame Clare Tickell said: The earliest years in a child’s life are absolutely critical. Next to a loving and stable home environment, high quality early years education is one of the most important factors in a child’s development. It’s clear that the current EYFS has helped to improve outcomes and is popular with parents and professionals who welcome a framework that lets them know how children are developing. But it’s far from perfect. The current EYFS is cumbersome, repetitive and unnecessarily bureaucratic. And it isn’t doing enough to engage parents in their child’s development or make sure children are starting school with the basic skills they need to be ready to learn. My recommendations will help give those professionals more freedom and are designed to make the entire system work better for children, professionals and parents. I hope my review leads to a slimmer, more resilient EYFS, that makes sure every child has the best possible start in life. Responding to Dame Clare’s report, Children’s Minister Sarah Teather said: The importance of the early years - as a foundation for life and for future attainment and success - cannot be over estimated. That’s why it’s vital we have the right framework to support high quality early years education. I am pleased that Clare has focused on what really matters - making sure a child is able to start school ready to learn, able to make friends and play, ready to ask for what they need and say what they think. These are critical foundations for really getting the best out of school. I’m also pleased that Clare has responded to the concerns we have all heard about the level of paperwork. Parents just want to know in a clear and frank way what their children are learning. I am hugely grateful to Clare and look forward to reading her review in detail. To help improve the experience of professionals working with children, Dame Clare has looked at the confusion that exists around the level of paperwork providers need to keep for Ofsted inspections. In the call for evidence, some practitioners felt there was sometimes too much focus on the inspection of forms and not enough on children’s experiences. To tackle this Dame Clare has recommended that Ofsted and local authorities work more closely together to provide consistent information on inspection. She will also recommend they avoid creating extra burdens by asking early years providers to keep paperwork that isn’t required. As part of her review, Dame Clare has consulted extensively with parents, nursery and early years practitioners, teachers and the voluntary and community sector. These views are collected in an Evidence Paper published alongside the report today. When questioned on their views of the EYFS, the vast majority (72 per cent) thought the EYFS was successful. And when questioned about the value of areas of learning, 82 per cent thought they provided an effective structure for young children’s learning. When asked what was the most important thing settings could do to support a child’s learning and development, 81 per cent of respondents said support for personal, social and emotional development - one of the three areas recommended by Dame Clare as a prime area of learning. But 30 per cent of those who responded to the call for overall views on EYFS felt there is too much bureaucracy and paperwork. And professionals were unclear how much paperwork they should be keeping for Ofsted inspections. On the question about the EYFS profile assessment at age 5, only 28 per cent of respondents said they liked the Profile in its current form. And many think the profile reports fail to draw out the most important things that teachers want to know when a child starts school. And in a survey of parents, less than half (42per cent) knew they should be given an update on their child’s development at the end of the EYFS, and only 36 per cent said they actually received it. Jean Gross, England’s Communication Champion for children, said I’m delighted with Dame Clare’s report. It preserves all the best of the current EYFS whilst helping us focus on making sure we get the basics - the new ‘prime’ areas of learning - right for all children. If implemented, it will mean that any difficulties children may have in their language, social and emotional or physical development are picked up much earlier, and that agencies can work together to provide timely support. Kate Groucutt, Policy Director at Daycare Trust, said: Daycare Trust is pleased that Dame Tickell has listened to the views of the early years sector by maintaining the Early Years Foundation Stage as a universal framework for all providers. The EYFS was introduced less than three years ago, yet it has already delivered clear benefits to children and providers alike. In particular we welcome the review’s emphasis on making the EYFS more accessible to parents. This must be accompanied by practical tools which support parents to play an active role in their child’s learning and development, as we know parents are so keen to do, and help them identify high quality early years services. Neil Leitch, Chief Executive of the Pre-school Learning Alliance, said: We welcome Dame Clare’s review of the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS). She and her team have done a great job in managing to take views from a wide range of sources and present a thoughtful and considered review of the EYFS without changing its core structure. We trust that in the light of the review the EYFS’s emphasis on learning through play will continue as this is a cornerstone of Alliance philosophy and has been embraced wholeheartedly by the early years sector. We welcome the review’s focus on the ‘prime areas’ of physical development, emotional development and communications as these are the focus of early years provision. If young children are given the support to develop in these areas as they grow, they will be well prepared to undertake formal learning at school. We also welcome the separation of literacy from the Communication, Language and Literacy learning area as this should ensure that no children - especially boys - are introduced to reading and writing too early, as such a move could impair their lifelong enjoyment of language and literature. Purnima Tanuku OBE, Chief Executive of National Day Nurseries Association (NDNA), said: NDNA welcomes how the review team has listened to a wide range of views and that the value of the EYFS in delivering for families has clearly been recognised. Overall this is an impressive report that considers all major issues. NDNA and its members were clear that radical change needed to be avoided and we are pleased that the review outlines ways that potentially the EYFS can be improved even further. NDNA very much looks forward to working with government to discuss these recommendations and what aspects should be taken forward. We will also be working closely with members to support them to respond to any potential changes and ultimately adapt their childcare practice so that they can continue to provide high-quality care and early learning that benefits children and families. Professor Chris Pascal, OBE, Director of the Centre for Research in Early Childhood, said: This Review builds on the strong achievements of the sector in raising quality using the original EYFS framework but refocuses attention on those aspects of practice that really shape children’s future lives and frees practitioners from many of the perceived burdens they felt were preventing progress. I particularly welcome the identification of the three ‘prime’ areas of learning as a key focus to our work in the early years and the clarification on assessment requirements and the closer involvement of parents. Also welcome is the acknowledgement of the critical importance of well trained professionals who understand children’s learning and development and see their partnership with parents as the critical element in their work. Leadership and commitment at all levels will be required to take forward the Review’s recommendations into policy and practice to ensure and safeguard the quality of services for our youngest children and families in the current challenging climate. Nicola Amies, Director of Early Years, Europe, Bright Horizons Family Solutions, said: Bright Horizons was proud to be invited to participate in the Tickell Review of the EYFS, representing those delivering the EYFS in the full daycare context, and we welcome many of the recommendations contained in the Expert Panel’s report. It is evident that the Panel considered thoughtfully the views submitted by so many providers and parents, and we believe that the recommendations contained in the report will do much to improve the experiences and outcomes of children attending nurseries and visiting childminders. For example, one of the key desires expressed by both parents and practitioners was for the streamlining of paperwork, so that staff can give more focus on what they do so well - their interactions with the children in their care. It is passion and commitment to children’s care, learning and development that draws the best people into the profession and we believe that their aspirations will be supported by the Review’s proposals. Dorian Bradley, Independent Advisor on EYFS exemptions, said: Revising the EYFS at a time when it was still bedding down but already delivering improved outcomes for children was a difficult task. I’m delighted therefore that Clare has done so well in ironing out some difficulties while maintaining all that is good to give an even better EYFS.  Notes to editors: The Government commissioned Dame Clare Tickell to carry out a review of the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) in July 2010.

/government/news/child-care-business-scheme-extended,"A scheme offering grants of up to £500 to people in England who want to start their own childcare business has been extended until 31 December 2014. The government’s Childcare Business Grant Scheme has already approved over 4,500 successful applications to help new childcare businesses get off the ground. The initiative, which was launched in April 2013, aims to support over 7,000 new childcare enterprises. It helps people pay for things like training, equipment, insurance and adaptations to premises that can otherwise be tough when you’re setting up a new business. Nicky Morgan, Minister for Women and Equalities said: The childcare business grant is a key part of our long-term economic plan. It has already benefited thousands of people, from nursery owners and childminders to the children of parents who use them. We know that it can be tough setting up your own business. This money is a helping hand for people who care about children and want to work looking after them. It will also encourage the creation of more childcare places, a key part of our plan to help parents who want to get back to work after having children. To celebrate the milestone, Children’s Minister Sam Gyimah today visited the Brown Bears Nursery in Tottenham, which owner Cheryl Brown opened up after accessing a grant. Children’s Minister Sam Gyimah said: We know that parents want good-quality, affordable and available childcare. The childcare business grant encourages the creation of more places, helping mothers get back to work. This money is a fantastic opportunity for anyone who wants to set up their own business to look after children. If you are thinking about taking the first steps towards becoming a childminder or nursery owner then I encourage you to apply. The grants offer £500 for those looking to start nurseries or look after disabled children, and £250 to prospective childminders. As part of the Childcare Business Grant Scheme, new childcare businesses are also being encouraged to team up with a free mentor so they can access free and specially-tailored start-up advice.

/government/news/ofsted-to-inspect-early-years-initial-teacher-training,"From April 2015 Ofsted will inspect early years initial teacher training providers which provide training for those working with children up to five years of age. This is part of a drive to help raise standards in nurseries and early years settings. Early years teacher status was created in September 2013. Early years teachers are graduates who provide leadership in nurseries and a range of other early years settings. They have to meet the same entry requirements as those applying to become primary school teachers. In all, there are approximately 40 accredited providers of qualified teacher status providing this early years initial teacher training at higher education institutions and school-centred initial teacher training across England. Ofsted currently inspects initial teacher training in the primary, secondary, and further education phases. However, this is the first time that early years initial teacher training will be inspected. Jo Morgan, Ofsted’s National Director for Initial Teacher Education, said: Early years teachers have a very important role. They help to create a culture in which young children can learn through play, and begin to get used to a structured day. This means they will be more ready to learn when they begin primary school. As Ofsted’s early years annual report identified, young children’s progress depends on the quality of early education and childcare they receive. It is crucial then that early years teacher training is of the highest quality possible. I am confident that these inspections will help to enhance the quality of training for early years teachers. In turn this will help ensure young children get the best start in life. Ofsted will update the Initial Teacher Education (ITE) inspection handbook before it begins to inspect early years initial teacher training providers in April. The early years initial teacher training phase will be subject to the same two-stage process, as in other phases, whereby inspectors will check on the quality of training and the trainees’ teaching in the summer term. There will be a second stage in the autumn term when inspectors will see how well early years teachers were prepared by their training to teach in a range of early years settings where they work."

/government/news/bureaucracy-axed-to-put-vulnerable-children-first,"Frontline professionals working to keep children safe from harm will be freed from pointless bureaucracy that has stifled their judgment for too long, under radical plans announced by the Government today. The Government published its plans to overhaul the child protection system axing hundreds of pages of instruction manuals and replacing it with short, precise guidance and checklists clearly listing roles and responsibilities. Ministers want to create a culture that places trust in health professionals, teachers, early years professionals, youth workers, police and social workers, so they can get on with their vital work, without being hampered by unnecessary rules and targets. Today the Children’s Minister Tim Loughton said professionals must now step-up to the challenge and lead the reforms. He published a consultation calling for views on the following: Radically reduced guidance that clearly states the law so all organisations know what they and others must do to protect children. It does not tell professionals how to do their job, but provides a checklist setting out their duties. New guidance on undertaking assessments of children in need. The guidance proposes to replace nationally prescribed timescales for assessments with a more flexible approach focused on the needs of each child. New guidance on Serious Case Reviews (SCRs) to help all services properly learn the lessons from them. The guidance proposes changes so SCRs get to the heart of what happened in a particular case and why, and set out what improvements need to be made to help prevent recurrence. Today’s consultation follows Professor Eileen Munro’s review, which said the child protection system was overly focused on compliance and too dependent on central prescription and rigid procedures. Children’s Minister Tim Loughton said: We want to change the child protection system fundamentally - I believe the changes proposed today will free hardworking social workers and other professionals from structures, procedures and rulebooks so they can do their best for vulnerable children and their families. This is a new mindset and a new relationship between central Government and local services. I am determined that we build on the excellent work of Professor Munro and I trust the workforce to deliver the reforms without the need for excessive central prescription. We have worked openly and collaboratively with professionals and children’s leaders to create reforms that are sustainable in the long term. The Government is not in the business of telling local services how to implement the reforms - as has happened in the past - because this has been shown by Professor Munro to result in unintended consequences. The Government confirmed that SCRs should be published in full to ensure that lessons are learned locally and nationally and also to give the public greater confidence in the child protection system. Tim Loughton: The Government is determined to improve the quality and impact of Serious Case Reviews and we need to ensure that we have a robust system to protect children. Unfortunately we can never eliminate all risk, but when tragedies do happen we need everyone to be clear about what went wrong and why. This new guidance is clear that reviews should be thorough and lead to sustainable improvements in services to prevent future harm. It is essential that as much information as possible is made public so the public can have confidence in the system that protects our most vulnerable children. The Government’s proposal to remove nationally prescribed timescales for assessments for children in need aims to allow a more flexible process of assessment focused on the individual child’s needs. Tim Loughton: These proposed changes build on the encouraging findings from eight trial authorities, which are testing more flexible approaches to assessment. Replacing rigid timescales gives space for social workers to exercise their professional judgment based on the needs of each child. Social workers believe the flexibilities allow them to work more efficiently than before. They are able to use their judgment and experience, rather than work to nationwide dictats. It is proposed that the three guidance documents, totalling 68 pages, will replace more than 700 pages of bureaucracy. The Government is clear that with greater freedoms comes greater accountability. The following steps have already been taken to reform the child protection system: Ofsted has begun new unannounced inspections of local authority child protection arrangements that have more focus on the quality of practice and the impact of help provided. A new child protection performance information framework shifts the focus away from processes and indicators towards performance measures that improve professional understanding and drive improvements locally. Steps to create a better qualified, more confident and more professional social work workforce with authoritative leadership and challenge from the newly established College of Social Work and the first ever Chief Social Worker in England who will be appointed later this year. Revised statutory guidance for local authority Directors and Lead Members of Children’s Services reinforces the importance of these roles and their accountability for child protection. Professor Eileen Munro, author of the Government’s review of the child protection system, said: This draft guidance is proof that reforms are rightly moving the focus of help and protection firmly onto children and young people. We are finally moving away from the defensive rule-bound culture that has been so problematic. I believe an urgent culture change in our child protection system is now underway. The guidance is clear and concise and leaves no one in any doubt on the expectations of all professionals in helping keep children safe. It moves responsibility for how to do that to local and professional control. Barnardo’s Chief Executive Anne Marie Carrie said: When faced with making difficult decisions about protecting a child, social workers need to first call on their professional judgment. Empowering practioners to do better for families means encouraging them to use their expertise and draw on their experience to make good choices, not giving them more guidelines to follow. We support changing the emphasis within the system to enable professionals to take responsibility for safeguarding the welfare of the most vulnerable children.

The release also includes the percentage of children achieving each individual scale point for each scale of the EYFSP. Individual scale point data is currently submitted on a voluntary basis by local authorities. The key points from this release are: The majority of children (ranging from 71% to 92%) continue to work securely within (achieving a total of 6 points or more) the early learning goals, in each of the 13 assessment scales. The percentage of children working securely within the early learning goals has increased in all 13 scales compared with 2011. Since the implementation of the statutory EYFS profile in 2009, there has been an increase in the percentage of children working securely across all scales, with the largest increase being 9 percentage points which was seen in two scales (communication, language and literacy: linking sounds and letters and writing). The assessment scales with the highest percentage of children working securely within the early learning goals were: physical development and personal, social and emotional development: dispositions and attitudes, both 92%. The assessment scale with the lowest percentage of children working securely within the early learning goals was: communication, language and literacy: writing - 71%. The assessment scale with the highest percentage of children working towards (achieving a total of 1 to 3 points) the early learning goals was communication, language and literacy: writing - 8%. The assessment scale with the lowest percentage of children achieving 1 to 3 points was personal social and emotional development: dispositions and attitudes - 1%. The assessment scale with the highest percentage of children working beyond (9 points) the early learning goals was problem solving, reasoning and numeracy: numbers as labels and for counting with 17%. The scales with the lowest percentage of children achieving 9 points are knowledge and understanding of the world and creative development with 3%. Girls continue to achieve at a higher level in all assessment scales compared to boys, with the largest gap in writing.

/government/speeches/sarah-teather-to-the-london-voluntary-service-council-conference-closing-the-gap-inequality-in-london,"The Government has a lot to be thankful for that organisations like the London Voluntary Service Council exist. We need critical friends like you - organisations who are prepared to challenge us, to work with us, to hold us to account, but also to make sure that you do that in a constructive way. And I’m very pleased to be here today to speak about issues that are very close to my heart as a minister and as an MP representing a constituency like Brent Central - tackling poverty in our city and promoting social inclusion. I thank you for the hard work you all you do with our Child Poverty Unit, through the London Child Poverty Delivery Group. And I thank you so much for your work you do on the ground, with the most marginalised and vulnerable groups in our society - dealing with the sort of issues that I see in my own constituency. I see how poor families struggle to cope every day - when some of the wealthiest in the country live a few streets away. I see how young people never achieve their full potential or fulfil their talents because of the barriers thrown up in their way - when their neighbours clear the same hurdles with ease. And I see the unacceptable reality in London today - that in the twenty-first century, a child born in Harlesden, in my constituency, is still expected to die more than ten years before one born a few miles down the road in Kensington. We have a moral duty to change this - that’s why we’re committed to ending child poverty by 2020. Breaking that cycle of disadvantage; building a fairer society; ending the inequality we see in this great city, and beyond, are the uniting passions of all of us in the coalition. Today I want to set out the task we face; the foundations we’ve begun to lay; and how our education, early years and welfare reforms, with the voluntary sector, are going to be vital to ending not just material poverty but the poverty of ambition in our society. The task ahead - results are all We need to start with asking ourselves hard questions. Why, after a decade or more of booming economic growth and public investment, are we still such an unequal society? Why has social mobility largely stalled since the 1970s? Why is there still a yawning attainment gap between rich and poor at five, which gets wider as they get older? Why does work still not pay for families wanting to escape a life on welfare? Disadvantage in Britain today too often gets passed from one generation to another. Birth still dictates your fate. Your parents’ income still predicts how well you do at school, your job, your expectations and hopes for your own children. One in five children still lives in poverty nationally. In inner London it is closer to one in three and in the area we are today, in Tower Hamlets, it is six out of ten. Almost two million children live in households where no one is in paid work. Almost two million live in poor housing - crowded rooms, squalid conditions, dangerous buildings. Just a quarter of our poorest children reached the most basic GCSE benchmark. And young people from poorer backgrounds are less than twice as likely to go to university as those from richer backgrounds. No one doubts the good intentions and hard work of the previous government of trying to deal with poverty. But you can’t judge your efforts simply by the billions you’ve thrown at tax credits. You have to judge it by results. Too much time and effort has been spent trying to move poor households across an arbitrary income line, without focusing on whether it actually transformed people’s life chances. Nobody is saying income isn’t important - it clearly is. If you don’t have enough money to feed or clothe yourself properly or put a roof over your head, then life is unimaginably tough, no matter what else you’re doing. But in the long term, the best way to tackle poverty is to break down the barriers so families can escape it: entrenched worklessness, economic dependency, and educational failure. Coalition - laying foundations So we’ve begun to set out our stall in the Spending Review - dealing with the mess in the public finances and sowing the seeds of economic recovery, while making sure we don’t burden future generations with the legacy of our mistakes. There is nothing fair about leaving our children and their children with unsustainable debts, higher taxes and public services stripped bare for decades, because we weren’t brave enough to deal with deficit now. We’ve had to take hard decisions in the national interest, while making the economic, social and moral case for protecting and strengthening the poorest as far as we can. Our budget in June and the Spending Review last month are not the whole story. We need more than investment - we have to deepen and broaden our thinking on how we tackle poverty. The fact is, we can only truly achieve success by giving people the chance to break free from their parents’ income and background; by equipping them with the right incentives, know-how, aspirations and skills to leave poverty behind. Firstly, through radical welfare reform - to make sure work always pay. And secondly, through unlocking social mobility by giving young people the best start in life - giving young people the opportunity to fulfil their potential. Welfare reform Taking the first. The welfare bill has almost doubled since 1997 and the system still creates few real rewards for people to get back into work. It can’t be right that tens of thousands still lose 90p out of every extra pound they earn, when they move back into work and their benefits are phased out. It’s unacceptable that tens of thousands of part-time workers are no better off in employment than on benefit - so see no incentive in increasing their hours. That’s a sign of an unfair society - burdening the poorest with the cost of our failure to face up to welfare reform. So we have set out a radical programme to ensure that work pays and gets people out of the poverty trap. Reforming the welfare system is not easy but we have made it clear that we will protect the most vulnerable by making sure that benefits are well targeted and fair. The Universal Credit will not reduce the level of support. It will make the system simpler and more efficient, with fewer benefits, fewer layers of bureaucracy and with financial support firmly focused on rewarding work. And all told, it will help reduce the number of workless households by around 300,000 within two or three years. The best start in life - early years and schools But we can’t stop there. Escaping from poverty is not just about income. It is about giving every single the person the chance to make real choices about their future without it being dependent on their background. And the keys to this are high-quality education and early years provision. Despite the state of the public finances, we made a very clear commitment in the Comprehensive Spending Review to focus what resources we have on education and on investing in the early years. I know many of you are anxious about funding. But in terms of education, we secured the best possible settlement given the circumstances: Sure Start children’s centres protected and accessible to all - but better targeting those with the greatest needs; free childcare for all three- and four-year-olds to 15-hours a week, with it extended to all disadvantaged two-year-olds for the first time; School funding cash protected, with a Pupil Premium on top, for children from the lowest income families that need the most support in class - an extra £2.5 billion by 2015. These changes can make a real difference to children’s lives. Michael Gove will be setting out a radical reform programme for schools this week - setting out in particular how we can attract the best teachers to the most deprived areas. The Pupil Premium will play a central role, meaning that from next September, teachers will have the funding they need to help our most disadvantaged children in the way they think is best - with one-to-one tuition, after school support, mentoring and coaching, instead of that cash being sucked elsewhere, as it is too often. But we also believe that we must also look much earlier than the start of school to really help families escape poverty. So over the last few months, I’ve been looking at how the poorest can get high-quality Early Years’ provision and family support. That’s why I’ve decided to enshrine in law that all disadvantaged two-year-olds will get the free childcare entitlement from 2013. That’s why we’re going to make Sure Start far better at reaching out to the poorest families in future - backed by an extra 4200 health visitors. That’s why we are breaking down the barriers which stop families giving their children the best - with more flexible working and shared parental leave. And that’s why we’re focusing on supporting families who have a disabled child, to make sure that they get the best possible support. Getting the structure right We want a shift in focus, right across government and local government towards early intervention and a much greater role for the voluntary sector. Two very important views will inform the government’s work in this area. We’ve asked Frank Field to look at a new measure of life chances and how we can tackle poverty best. And we’ve asked Graham Allen to do a review of best practice around early intervention. We recognise that every area is different and so we want a very different relationship with local authorities. We want to get away from an approach where Government tells local authorities exactly what they must do on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday and what order they must do it in. Tower Hamlets is very different to Brent. And they are both certainly very different to Surrey or Yorkshire. We need to be able to give freedom to local authorities to make decisions on the ground and to decide how best to target resources. That’s why when we set out the details of the new Early Intervention Grant next week, every area will have the freedom to get on with the job. We do want councils to focus much more on outcomes, not just the numbers of people that have gone through their system. And we will use payment by results to try and drive that process. We won’t tell councils exactly how to work with the people on the ground. But we believe that the voluntary sector is often the key to tackling the most disadvantaged groups. It has enormous expertise but at the moment it is not utilised enough. We’re determined to open up the market to make sure it can be better involved in delivering services for young people, Sure Start and families with multiple problems. We will use the Localism Bill to try and drive this process. So if the voluntary sector, for example, thinks it can run a children’s centre or is better placed to tackle some of the most difficult, hard-to-reach groups in their local area, we will allow it the right to challenge local authorities to put those services out to tender. We will be announcing more about that very soon. Conclusion So I’ve tried to lay out some of the main themes around the government’s policy on tackling poverty and inequality over the next few years. I want to work much more closely with the voluntary sector in shaping that vision. So I say again, we need organisations like you that challenge us, that focus our attention to make sure we stick to the pledges we make, and judge us by our results."

/government/news/ofsted-consults-on-separate-judgements,"The proposed changes, due to come into effect from September 2014, are designed to ensure inspectors place as much emphasis on these important stages of children’s education as on the quality of provision for 5 to 16-year-olds. Ofsted wants to hear from schools, parents and other parties about whether they think the plans will provide a more rounded view of those academies and local authority maintained schools that provide these stages of education. The consultation is published as Ofsted begins to consider how school inspections might develop more generally in future years. Evidence from the 7,000 inspections it carries out each year indicates that not all schools need to be inspected in the same way. Ofsted will consult on any wider, longer-term changes to school inspection in due course. Ofsted’s National Director for Schools, Michael Cladingbowl, said: ‘We know that the early years of education set children up for life – so it is really important that schools get this right. I want our inspection reports to be even clearer about how well children are doing in reception and nursery classes. It’s also important that parents and young people have a clear understanding of how well the school’s sixth form is doing so they can make informed choices about where to continue their studies when they reach 16. We are keen to hear the views of parents and learners as well as providers about our proposals to bring in these separate judgements. We are also giving a lot of thought to how school inspection might develop over the longer term and will bring forward proposals for consultation in due course. The consultation issued today asks two questions: should there be a separate graded judgement on the effectiveness of the early years in the schools inspection framework from September 2014? should there be a separate graded judgement on the effectiveness of a school’s sixth form? Notes to editors Inspection of maintained schools and academies: consultation on the introduction of separate graded judgements on early school years and sixth form from September 2014 is available online . This proposes the introduction of separate graded judgements for the nursery, where applicable, and reception years; and for the sixth form, in Ofsted inspections of maintained schools and academies. The consultation runs from today for eight weeks until Tuesday 13 May. Ofsted will then publish a report which summarises the responses to this consultation. Ofsted will take account of responses in the revised school inspection framework from September 2014. [Contact:2325]"
/government/news/deputy-prime-minister-encourages-parents-in-oxfordshire-to-take-up-offer-of-free-childcare-for-two-year-olds,"From this September, 15 hours of free childcare a week will be made available to more than 1,100 two-year-olds across the county from lower income backgrounds. The first of these eligible toddlers will have their second birthdays this month. The Deputy Prime Minister today visited a nursery in Oxfordshire, where he met with parents, staff and children. Nick Clegg, Deputy Prime Minister, said:  High quality early learning can make a huge difference to children at the start of their lives. By getting things right from the off, they are much more likely to be ready when they start school. “I want to make sure no child in Oxfordshire loses out, which is why more than a thousand two-year-olds in the country will be eligible for free childcare starting this September.” “I’m determined to help parents with young children and this is just a part of a wide range of measures, including £1,200 of free childcare every year for under 12s and allowing parents to share maternity leave for the first time.” Parents can find out if their two-year-old is eligible by contacting either their local nursery provider or their local authority. Places will initially be targeted on children from families receiving an out-of-work benefit and those who are looked after by their local authority. Children from disadvantaged backgrounds are known to be more at risk of poor development, with evidence showing that differences emerge early on in life. High quality early education can make a difference to a child’s progress and the additional Government money will help to make sure children from poorer families do not lose out. Currently, more than 850,000 three and four year olds nationally access up to 15 hours of free early education every week - one of several measures the Government is taking to support parents with children in childcare. Last month, the Deputy Prime Minister and Prime Minister announced that working families will receive up to £1,200 per child to help with the cost of childcare from 2015. This followed an announcement by the Deputy Prime Minister that in two years parents will be entitled to share ‘maternity’ leave for the first ever time, with parents’ right to request flexible working from their employers also to be extended. Both measures are aimed at helping parents, particularly working mums, combine work and parenting after having children. Notes to editors From September 2014, the number of two-year-olds eligible for free childcare will double to 2,300. Children from families receiving one of the following meet the criteria for free childcare from September: Income Support Income-based Job Seekers’ Allowance Income-related Employment and Support Allowance Support under Part VI of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 the Guaranteed element of State Pension Credit If you have an annual income of less than £16,190 and get Child Tax Credit, provided you are not also entitled to Working Tax Credit."
/government/speeches/nick-cleggs-speech-on-education-and-outstanding-leaders,"The fundamental reason why I believe education matters quite simply is to ensure every child has a fair chance of a successful life. That’s also why, I expect, many of you got into the teaching profession in the first place. Yet despite the efforts of successive governments and the progress made to raise education standards in the country, on average, children from poorer families still do worse than their better-off peers. As last week’s report from the independent Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission shows, here in Britain, your parents’ income still remains the biggest indicator of what you’ll then go on to achieve. More than your talent, more than your potential. And more than in most other countries in Europe. Some claim this is just a fact of life. They argue that any chance for social mobility in this country ended when the final bell rang for grammar schools, and disparage any efforts to break the link between disadvantage and achievement as social engineering at its worst. Others believe attainment is biologically predetermined – the future genetically carved in stone before a child even steps near a classroom. I cannot accept either view. In politics, and in this coalition, what motivates me - more than any other issue – is increasing social mobility: building a fairer society, where everyone can succeed, irrespective of the circumstances of their birth. So, when we came into government, in education, we prioritised 3 things: first, ending micromanagement of our schools. For too long, previous administrations responded to every problem in our education system with a new target from central government – frustrating our teachers and stifling the creativity needed to drive excellence across the board. Second, we wanted to use the muscle of the state to level the playing field so that all children can flourish – not just the well-off. That’s what our £2.5 billion pupil premium is for – additional money to help close the gap, which we are beginning to see having an effect. And, third, we wanted to make sure that the state is intervening where it can make the biggest difference - when children are young. Access to high-quality early years education helps give children the best possible start in life. That’s why I have made the early years a personal priority: we have increased the hours available for 3 and 4-year-olds and extended it to 2-year-olds in families which are most feeling the squeeze. Last month I announced free school meals for all children in infant school; and, one of the first things David Laws did when he became Schools Minister was insist that we rebalanced the pupil premium so that more of the money goes to children when they are in primary school, to help them catch up before they fall too far behind. So, freedom for schools, a level playing field for all children: and more support for children in their earliest years. It’s an approach that seeks to drive diversity and autonomy within the schools system, but with the guarantee of opportunities for all. So freedom, yes, but with fairness too. For liberals, it is essential we provide both. Freedom with fairness I’m proud of our work over the last 3 years to increase school autonomy, which, in government, has been through the academies programme. [political content removed] We believe greater autonomy enables school leaders to take responsibility in those areas where they know what’s best for their pupils, whilst also giving them the freedom to innovate. [political content removed] Whilst I want to give schools the space to innovate, I also believe every parent needs to know that the school their child attends, whatever its title or structure, meets certain core standards of teaching and care. A parental guarantee - if you like. Parents don’t want ideology to get in the way of their children’s education. They don’t care about the latest political label attached to their child’s school. What they want, and expect, is that their children are taught by good teachers, get taught a core body of knowledge, and get a healthy meal every day. What is the point of having a slimmed-down national curriculum if only a few schools have to teach it? Let’s teach it in all our schools. And what is the point of having brilliant new food standards if only a few schools have to stick to the rules? Let’s have quality food in all our schools. That’s my philosophy. Diversity amongst schools, yes. But good universal standards all parents can rely on too. And, frankly, it makes no sense to me to have qualified teacher status if only a few schools have to employ qualified teachers. Over the last 10 years, there’s been a revolution in the way in which we’ve recruited and trained our teachers. Whether it’s through the on-the-job learning offered through schemes like Teach First and School Direct or the continued contribution of our universities to educating generations of Britain’s teachers. Together, these diverse routes into the classroom have raised the public profile and status of our teachers and enabled more graduates, more teaching assistants and more people from a range of backgrounds to join this great profession. What all of these routes have in common is that at the end of them you are recognised as a Qualified Teacher. And I want every parent to know that their child will benefit from this kind of high quality teaching. That’s why I believe we should have qualified teachers in all our schools. That means free schools and academies too. This view has sparked quite a bit of excitement this week – and a fair amount of criticism: the idea that, if you seek to give parents reassurances on basic standards, you are somehow turning your back on school autonomy. Or, equally, the criticism is that having open differences of this kind is bad for coalition government. [political content removed] But I am totally unapologetic for believing that, as we continue to build a new type of state funded school system – in which parents are presented with a dizzying range of independent, autonomous schools, each with its own different specialism, ethos or mission – parents can make their choice safe in the knowledge that there are certain safeguards. A safety net, if you like, to prevent their children from falling through the cracks. So, yes, I support free schools and academies, but not with exemptions from minimum standards. [political content removed] There is nothing – absolutely nothing – inconsistent in believing that greater school autonomy can be married to certain core standards for all. [political content removed] We will also strive to make sure that every parent can send their children off in the morning, knowing that, whatever kind of school they go to – academy, free school, maintained school, whatever – their sons and daughters will be taught core subjects, by qualified teachers and they’ll get a healthy meal. [political content removed] Teachers And I can tell you today that one area where we have agreed further reform is on better support for our teachers and school leaders – the people who are too often missing from the debate on structures and standards. It’s a cliché to say it, but no less true that what you never forget about your school days are those teachers who changed your life. A good teacher knows how to inspire and enthral a class of children to learn - whatever the subject. He or she recognises each child for the individual that they are, and does whatever they can to help that child build on their talents for a happy, successful life. As a father of 3 school-age children, I also speak from experience when I say these are the teachers that your children never stop talking about when they get home from school. That special connection - with someone who makes you as enthusiastic about learning, as they are about teaching - is what defines, for many of us, the very best in education. It’s what we want for our children. It’s what we expect from our local schools. And critically, it’s what the brightest and best teachers in Britain strive to achieve every single day. As Jemima Reilly, the head here said: We are proud to attract and maintain good quality teachers…we give our teachers the space to grow and in turn their students grow and flourish alongside them. London Challenge - the programme that helped raise standards in London – including this part of London – worked because it gave many London teachers the leadership, authority and support they needed to challenge and learn from each other. It became the mission of every teacher in a London school to improve standards across the city. And as Ofsted has pointed out, if you’re a poor child going to school in some other parts of Britain, you’re less likely to do well than poor children here in Tower Hamlets. This isn’t just Britain’s inner cities that we’re talking about here. In some cases, these are relatively prosperous regions like West Berkshire and Shropshire and our seaside towns like Blackpool or Hastings. The issue isn’t that there aren’t brilliant schools or teachers in those areas. There are. But there are also weak schools and schools which have simply stalled. These schools are failing many children – including from disadvantaged backgrounds – who with the right support and attention could thrive. The good teachers in these schools, they want to learn from their better performing neighbours. But they don’t have a clear idea about how to start that conversation. They want to improve, they want to do more for local children and parents from all backgrounds. But they don’t have the right leadership and skills on site to boost their performance. They want to share their own knowledge of what works beyond their own classroom with their colleagues. But they don’t know how to make that happen. They can’t progress. Their schools are stalled and could do much better. And, worse of all, the children they teach are heading for a life defined by their background not by their talents. We already know that some good local authorities are meeting that challenge by helping schools in their area find good leaders. And our ‘Similar Schools’ data is designed to help schools – without that kind of support – to link up and learn from outstanding schools tackling the same issues as them. So, as we improve the information available online, I’d certainly encourage more schools to use it. But we need to do more if we’re to tackle this issue nationally and ensure that more schools can benefit from the expertise of our best head teachers. Head Teachers That’s why I’m pleased to announce today that the government will be setting up a programme to get outstanding leaders into the schools that need them the most . The Department for Education will be setting out further details in due course. But what I can say is that there will be a pool of top talent within the profession – a sort of Champions League of Head Teachers if you like – made up of Heads and Deputy Heads, who will stand ready to move to schools in challenging circumstances that need outstanding leaders. So if you’re a school facing tough challenges and finding it hard to recruit an exceptional leader, you’ll be able to call on this team and request someone with a proven leadership track record. We’re looking for experienced Head Teachers ready for a new challenge, or bright Deputy Heads looking to take the next step in their career and lead a school. If you are selected, we’d need you to make a real commitment to the school, its staff and its children. You’ll receive help to relocate to the areas where you’re needed and the necessary professional support to turn around your school. And we will work to help you in your new role taking on this challenging school. This programme is entirely voluntary. No one will be forced to accept one of these positions or move. We want the first of these leaders to be in place from September of next year [2014]. Initially the scheme will start small, but our ambition is for this team to become as important to our education system as Teach First. So in conclusion, if we’re to build a stronger economy and a fairer society in Britain, then we need every child in every region of our country to be succeeding. That’s the vision I have for education in this country. A system built on greater choice, innovation, accountability and excellence: designed to benefit everyone. Where every school has the freedom, autonomy and resources to thrive; where every teacher is empowered to be the best, progressing and improving throughout their career; where every parent has a guarantee that their child will receive the best standard of education available; and where every child gets the attention, support and excellent teaching they need to achieve the happy and fulfilling life they want."

/government/news/more-help-with-childcare-costs-for-working-families-announced,"Visiting a London nursery, the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister discussed the new Tax-free Childcare scheme with local parents. Once fully up and running, the scheme will be worth up to £1,200 per child, and will save a typical working family with two children under 12 up to £2,400 a year. It will be phased in from autumn 2015 and will ultimately be open to around 2.5 million families with children under 12. From the first year of operation, all children under 5 will be eligible, initially opening the scheme to 1.3 million families, and the scheme will build up over time to include children under 12. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said: I want to help every family to get on in life. Already we have created a million private sector jobs, put money back in people’s pockets by cutting income tax, and extended free childcare entitlements for pre-school children. “Delivering tax-free childcare is the next step to ensuring all families can work and get on. The rising cost of childcare is one of the biggest challenges parents face and it means many mums and dads simply can’t afford to work. This not only hurts them financially, but is bad for the economy too. This announcement of a £1bn investment in childcare will make sure it pays to work. “An extra £1,200 for each child will make a real difference to families who find themselves constantly worrying about how to juggle their family budget.  And extending support for working families on Universal Credit will make sure it is worth working extra hours even if you’re on low wages.” The government will shortly consult on the detail of the new Tax-free Childcare scheme, including on how employers could continue to play a role in supporting their employees with childcare costs within the new system. Full detail on the new scheme is available from HM Treasury ."

The offer aims to improve disadvantaged children’s social and cognitive outcomes so that by the age of 5 they are as ready as their more advantaged peers to start and fully benefit from school. The programme aims to provide good quality early education combined with support for parents, for example, to improve their confidence in supporting their children’s learning and to deal with other challenges in their lives, such as health problems and family difficulties. The report presents the findings of a study of the ‘2-year-olds’ offer’, a programme that provides free early education to disadvantaged two year olds in England. A case study approach was used to explore in depth the research questions from the perspective of local authorities, stakeholders and childcare providers.

/government/news/extra-funding-to-prepare-for-the-early-years-pupil-premium,"New government funding will be given to councils to help them prepare for the introduction of the early years pupil premium, Childcare Minister Sam Gyimah announced yesterday (12 February 2015). The early years pupil premium ( EYPP ) , worth £50 million in 2015 to 2016, will be given to early years providers who are delivering the funding entitlement for 3- and 4-year-olds. The funding equates to up to £300 extra per year for each disadvantaged child who meets the eligibility criteria. The Department for Education is giving councils an additional £1.5 million to help them get ready. It means that each council with eligible children will receive £10,000 to support the introduction of the early years pupil premium - and they can choose how best to use the money. Councils may choose to upgrade their IT systems to smooth the transition or use the funding to communicate with their local providers. Childcare Minister Sam Gyimah said: I’m delighted we are helping the most disadvantaged children access high-quality early education, giving them the best possible start in life. The early years pupil premium gives money to providers so they can make sure eligible children have the best possible outcomes when they start school and beyond. The early years count and it will be life-changing for many of these children. I would encourage any parent who meets the criteria to let a local provider know, so that their child can get the right support at the right time. Schools Minister David Laws said: Every child should be able to reach their full potential, no matter what their background. The pupil premium is already helping to build a fairer society with opportunity for everyone. The extension of the pupil premium to early years will give toddlers from the poorest families the support they need to develop and learn at this important early stage. This additional funding will ensure providers have the resources to give all children the best possible start in life. From April, providers will be able to access the EYPP to help them support their most disadvantaged children. Children will qualify if they are 3 or 4 years old, are receiving government-funded early education, and their parents receive benefits used to access eligibility for free school meals. Evidence shows that children from less advantaged backgrounds can start school 19 months behind their peers, but that good quality childcare can reduce this gap and have a significant benefit in terms of a child’s development. Children who receive good-quality early years education go on to earn around £27,000 more during their career compared to those who don’t, and are also likely to do better at school - the equivalent of 7 GCSE grades at grade B compared to grade C. This is the latest step in the government’s drive to provide high-quality early years education to all children, no matter what their background. Free childcare for 2-year-olds was introduced in 2013, with the number of places available doubling nationally to reach around 40% of all 2-year-olds from September 2014. In addition, all 3- and 4-year-olds are entitled to free childcare. The government will also this year introduce tax-free childcare, giving almost 2 million families up to £2,000 support per child, and from 2016, for families on the lowest incomes, up to 85% of their childcare costs will be met under Universal Credit. Parents should contact their local authority to find out if their 2-year-old is entitled to 15 hours of free childcare a week Notes to editors In January, 7 areas were given more than £1 million to become early implementers of the EYPP . Authorities in Blackpool, Bristol, Cambridgeshire, North Yorkshire, Northamptonshire, Hackney and Stoke-on-Trent will feedback to the Department for Education about their experiences implementing the EYPP . All registered early years providers that take children for the funded early education entitlement - including school nurseries and maintained nursery schools; private, voluntary and independent providers; and childminders - will be eligible to claim the EYPP for eligible 3- and 4-year-olds. Children will be eligible if they are 3 or 4 years old and receiving government-funded early education in any provider, and their parents are in receipt of 1 or more of the following benefits, which are the benefits used to access eligibility for free school meals: Income Support income-based Jobseekers Allowance income-related Employment and Support Allowance support under part 6 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 the guaranteed element of State Pension Credit Child Tax Credit (provided they’re not also entitled to Working Tax Credit and have an annual gross income of no more than £16,190) Working Tax Credit run-on - paid for 4 weeks after they stop qualifying for Working Tax Credit Universal Credit Or if they have been: looked after by the local authority for at least 1 day have been adopted from care have left care through special guardianship subject to a child arrangement order setting out with whom the child is to live (formerly known as residence orders) Last year’s research into school readiness, mentioned in the press release, was the Effective Pre-school Primary and Secondary Education ( EPPSE ) report.

/government/speeches/extending-opportunity-through-the-pupil-premium,"Thank you for that introduction, and I’m delighted to be here for today’s very important summit. The Sutton Trust - with Sir Peter at the helm - has a long track record of working tirelessly to extend opportunity to the poorest and most disadvantaged in our society. Which is entirely in line with my determination to ensure that every child, regardless of background, is given an education which allows them to realise their full potential. I would like to congratulate you on your report out today - which highlights some successes of the pupil premium, and poses some important questions for all of us. For years, the Sutton Trust has sought to reverse the education inequalities that sadly still exist in our society - a goal that lies at the centre of this government’s work, too. That’s why we delivered on the 2010 Conservative manifesto commitment to introduce the pupil premium , and have spent £6.25 billion on it to date. It’s also why we worked with you to establish the Education Endowment Foundation - to develop the talents of all disadvantaged children and young people, and help them succeed. And it’s why, over the past 5 years, this government has worked hard to offer you security at every stage of your life. We have helped: 2 million more people into work 2.2 million young people have started an apprenticeship almost 4 million of the lowest paid have been lifted out of income tax altogether and of course, a record 82% of schools are now deemed good or outstanding But in spite of these big steps forward - we know there is more to do to tackle educational inequality. Too many people, and too many young people in particular, are still falling behind. If even one child has their life stunted or their options limited: by other people’s expectations or circumstances beyond their control by where they live or because of the family that raises them then that’s one child too many. Ambition for every child All of us here, I’m sure, will have seen the Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission report from the other week, stating that bright children from poorer backgrounds are still failing to access the top jobs, thanks to an enduring prejudice in elite firms. More needs to be done, across every sector, to ensure that the highest echelons of public life - our judges, senior ranks of the armed forces, and yes, parliamentarians, too - can be accessed by all talented individuals. Companies like PricewaterhouseCoopers, Barclays and BT pride themselves on helping students from poorer backgrounds into great jobs. And I hope that in time we will see a wider cultural shift towards their inclusive approach. Whilst employers and universities have more to do, it’s in classrooms that we can begin to unlock the talent of disadvantaged pupils. So that one day, it is their CV will make it to the top of the pile. There will always be a debate about what works best when it comes to intervening in the lives of the most disadvantaged. I think there is one thing, however, that everyone can agree on. That is, extending opportunity always starts with a good education. So, our mission in government and my mission in the department for Education is to deliver educational excellence everywhere - and ensure that every child, regardless of background, receives an education that equips them with the skills and knowledge they need to succeed. That means extra support for the most disadvantaged and those who need the most help. Even before the pupil premium, an IFS report from March showed that there was substantially more money directed to the poorest pupils. Funding was 35% higher in the most deprived primary schools, and 41% higher in the most deprived secondary schools. It is right that these students are supported by targeted funding. Which is why in this Parliament, we’re continuing to fund the pupil premium, investing £2.5 billion this year. Supporting bright pupils from poor backgrounds We’ve already set some ambitious targets when it comes to raising standards, and schools have put our plan for education into action, and I thank them for that: at 16, the new attainment gap measure for GCSEs shows that the achievement gap has narrowed by almost four percent since 2012 at age 11, the gap between disadvantaged pupils and others in reading, writing, and mathematics has decreased by 2% Ofsted’s assessment last year stated that schools are using the pupil premium more effectively than ever before and we have raised the standards of early years – there are record numbers of children in nurseries and 85% of children are in childcare that is rated ‘good’ or ‘outstanding’ But we’ve got to go even further. It’s not enough just to hope that the pupil premium reaches the right children - because evidence from the National Audit Office and Education Endowment Foundation shows that in too many cases, it still isn’t getting there. So we will back the smart work of teachers and headteachers, including many of you here today, to see that the pupil premium achieves even more. And, as I have said before, that work has got to be about more than ‘closing the gap’. Pupils that lag behind their peers should be encouraged to reach their full potential and to go further than simply ‘catching up’. If we would want our own children to study the core academic subjects, we should extend that opportunity to every child. The soft bigotry of low expectation has no place in today’s schooling. That is why I intend that every secondary school starter in September will study the EBacc subjects at GCSE . The days of ushering children from poorer homes towards so-called ‘easier topics’; that made their lives harder in the long run, are over. Because it shouldn’t just be the children of highly literate families that get an A* in English. Or those who can afford evening tuition that become excellent mathematicians. Allowing every child to study the EBacc will raise academic standards for all. It will put an end to the quiet discrimination that once operated in too many schools. When disadvantaged pupils faced unfair barriers to achievement. Getting more from the pupil premium The pupil premium was designed to promote an equality of opportunity, and to make that journey to academic excellence easier. There is always a risk, even in the best schools, that there’ll be one child, hiding at the back of the classroom, who will leave with fewer qualifications, and fewer prospects, than their peers. His or her talent and ambition never fully exploited, because for one reason or another, ‘average’ was always considered good enough. That’s why we are taking action to intervene in coasting or failing schools - those which allow children to get by on ‘good enough’ instead of stretching them to their full potential. Because if we continue to fail these children, then we fail a fundamental test of a fair society. Yesterday’s National Audit Office report, ‘Funding for Disadvantaged Pupils’ - told us that when it comes to the pupil premium, schools face some important challenges. Challenges around how we can disseminate what works, how we can get more schools to review what they do with the money, and how to make the profession even more evidence-based. Applying the premium in a scatter-gun fashion, with the assumption that it will find its way to those who need it, is not transformative enough. The needs of an inner-city pupil will differ greatly from a young person at a coastal school. Careful application of the funding will see it reaching the most disadvantaged children. Research from the Education Endowment Foundation has already revealed so much about how schools can sensibly spend money to improve the outcomes of disadvantaged pupils: that extrinsic rewards like money or free tickets have very little effect on teenage motivation and GCSE grades that at a minimal cost, memorable trips and storytelling sessions can vastly improve the writing skills of year 6s and 7s and the ‘ Thinking ,Talking, Doing Science ’ approach has been effective in raising science grades of girls, in particular So I see the Education Endowment Foundation as a key partner in helping schools to spend the premium more strategically, and to put what works into practice. Like the work of Ark Charter Academy in Portsmouth, who have introduced longer school days. Or the parental workshops of Parkfield Community School in Birmingham. Both schools have boosted the attainment of their pupils, and I want innovation like this to be the norm, not the exception. And I want to challenge every school to follow the progress of their most disadvantaged children ever more closely. And realise that the work isn’t over when they get the funding, that is just beginning. Conclusion Ladies and gentlemen, a good education remains the first step on a journey towards a brighter and more prosperous future. I know that the best schools and teachers are working day in and day out to make this a reality. The pupil premium is not simply an illusion of extra support. With limitless ambition - the real spoils of success will be the disadvantaged students who complete their studies on an equal footing - and the plentiful opportunities that then await them. Thank you for listening and enjoy your day."

/government/news/government-announces-pupil-premium-to-raise-achievement,"A new pupil premium to raise achievement among disadvantaged children will start from 2011, the government announced today. As set out in the coalition government document, the new pupil premium will provide additional funding for more disadvantaged pupils to ensure they benefit from the same opportunities as pupils from richer families. Education Secretary Michael Gove and Children’s Minister Sarah Teather have launched a consultation to seek views on how best to operate the premium including what deprivation indicator to use. The premium will help target money so that more can be done to help children from disadvantaged backgrounds that are still not doing as well at school as they could or should do. Education Secretary Michael Gove said: Schools should be engines of social mobility. They should provide the knowledge, and the tools, to enable talented young people to overcome accidents of birth and an inheritance of disadvantage in order to enjoy greater opportunities. Children from poorer backgrounds, who are currently doing less well at school, are falling further and further behind in the qualifications race every year - and that in turn means that they are effectively condemned to ever poorer employment prospects, narrower social and cultural horizons, less by way of resources to invest in their own children - and thus a cycle of disadvantage and inequality is made worse with every year that passes. Last year of the 80,000 pupils who had been on free school meals just 45 made it to Oxbridge. Just 2 out of 57 countries now have a wider attainment gap between the highest and lowest achieving pupils. This is not good enough and addressing this disparity is a top priority of the coalition government. It is for this reason that we are implementing a pupil premium, to ensure that extra funding is targeted at those deprived pupils that most need it. The latest figures available show that: only 53% of 7- to 11-year-olds known to be eligible for free school meals (FSM) achieved the expected level in both English and mathematics compared with 75% for non FSM pupils just 27% of pupils eligible for FSM achieved 5 A* to C GCSEs or equivalent, including English and mathematics, compared with 54% for pupils not eligible for FSM The proposed pupil premium would provide additional per pupil funding on top of the existing funding provided to schools. Schools will be free to spend the additional funding as they choose to raise the achievement of disadvantage pupils. Children’s Minister Sarah Teather said: For too long social background has been a deciding factor in a child’s achievement and future prospects. In a fair society, it’s the government’s responsibility to close the gulf in achievement, where the poorest children are almost 3 times less likely to leave school with five good GCSEs than their richer classmates. That’s why I’m delighted we are today announcing a new pupil premium, which will give extra funding to schools to help them tackle the inequalities that have been a part of our state system for far too long. Thousands of children will finally be getting the extra support they need to succeed. The consultation on the pupil premium sets out options for how deprivation is calculated including: free school meal (FSM) eligibility - which could be current eligibility or a measure of whether the pupil has ever been eligible for FSM out-of-work tax credit - pupils in families in receipt of out-of-work tax credit commercial classifications such as ACORN or MOSAIC used by some local authorities In addition, the government set out its proposal for the pupil premium to: include looked after children who have consistently low attainment with only 15% achieving 5 GCSEs or equivalents compared to 70% of all children explore extending to cover service children who face unique challenges and need to be supported as they progress through school as armed forces families The government also set out its proposals for distributing overall school funding from April 2011. School funding will in the short term continue to be allocated using the current method to allow the pupil premium to be introduced smoothly. However, the government signalled its intention to review school funding for all schools including academies beyond the 2011 to 2012 year and details will be announced in due course. The school funding consultation is also seeking views on ending the policy of funding a minimum of 90% of a local authority’s 3-year-old population ceasing to funding dual-subsidiary registrations at pupil referral units (PRUs) a proposal to allow local authorities to apply for additional funding where they have schools serving service children, whose pupil numbers are affected by troop movements a proposal to allow local authorities to claim for 10% of a unit of funding for home-educated pupils an intention to have a minimum funding guarantee In addition, the government announced today that all local authorities will be required to introduce the early years single funding formula (EYSFF) from April 2011. For too long, early years funding has been inconsistent and patchy across the country - with too many children, particularly from disadvantaged families, not accessing any or all of their free nursery education hours. The EYSFF will require all local authorities to be transparent about the funding that they are providing for free nursery education for 3- and 4-year-olds, so that parents and providers are able to hold their local authority to account. It will also require local authorities to fund providers for the children that attend their nursery - rather than allowing funding to be wasted on empty places. This will help to ensure that nurseries are making the best effort to fill their places by attracting and encouraging more families to take up free nursery education for their child. The government has pledged to ensure that funding is focused on supporting those children from disadvantaged families who benefit most from nursery education. For that reason, every local formula must include a deprivation supplement so that more money will be targeted at the children who need it most. This will be set locally in the short term, but we will look at whether - over time - it is feasible to introduce a pupil premium for the early years. Notes for editors The consultation on school funding for the year 2011 to 2012 is available on the Department for Education’s e-consultations website and closes on 18 October 2010. A written ministerial statement that has been made to Parliament and a Q&A document are available to download. Until the comprehensive spending review has concluded this autumn, the government will not be able to give an indication of precise funding allocations. The additional pupil premium funding will not be ring fenced at school level allowing schools to decide how this extra funding should be best spent to benefit the individual pupils it is targeted at. Schools will get help and advice from government on how best they can use the money to raise pupil attainment, by publishing information and evidence about what works, including about the impact of new and innovative practice. The government will monitor the achievements of disadvantaged children who are likely to benefit from the premium. [Contact:997]"
/government/speeches/sam-gyimah-at-a-national-day-nurseries-association-conference,"Thank you, Purnima, for that very kind introduction. January can be the bleakest of months - it’s cold, it’s dark, all traces of Christmas and New Year celebrations have been left far behind, and resolutions for new exercise regimes and healthier diets are strictly underway! So I’m glad to be brightening up one of the dark evenings by celebrating the childcare sector. Because make no mistake, the sector, by and large, is thriving: this year’s LaingBuisson nursery market report estimates that the UK children’s daycare market was worth £4.9 billion in the 2013 to 2014 financial year - a real-term increase of 4.1%, year on year that means that the market is now almost one-third larger than it was a decade ago almost half of nurseries expect business conditions to improve by mid-2015 in fact, demand may increase by as much as 15% by 2015 to 2016 there are more registered places in full daycare settings, and more places in the most deprived areas there aren’t many countries in which over 90% of 3- and 4-year-olds are enrolled in early education Good news. For nurseries, for families, and most of all, for children. Evidence shows that early education enhances children’s development, especially for children from more disadvantaged backgrounds. And the positives are long-lasting. Children who go to pre-school are projected to earn an impressive £27,000 more during their career than those who don’t. And they’re more likely to get better GCSE results - the equivalent of getting 7 Bs instead of 7 Cs. That’s the kind of difference that can change a young person’s whole future for the better. And early education also helps parents - mothers, in particular, who choose to get on and work. By giving parents the choice to go back to work, and the confidence to know that their children are in a safe pair of hands, you’re providing a real boost to society and our economy. So I don’t think any of us here would ever try and deny the benefits of high-quality early education! But I do know that for some nurseries, increased demand can mean ever-increasing hurdles to jump - for some of you, it might not always feel like the sector is thriving. But we do value your businesses - and, of course, we value what you do. As the people in charge of educating the next generation and supporting families, it can be easy to forget you’re also business owners and entrepreneurs. Many NDNA (National Day Nurseries Association) nurseries are single- or small-site chains, and that means money is always going to be top of your mind. Believe me, I have a background in business, and I know how it can feel! I’ve read the NDNA ’s annual nursery survey - and I was concerned by some of the findings. In particular, you’ve said that local authorities are slow in paying you for your free entitlements, which impacts on your cash flow, particularly for smaller nurseries. In fact, almost 40% of local authorities pay over a month after term has started, when you know as well as I do that the law requires them to pay within 30 days. And there’s one particular example that I know concerns a lot of you, and it’s something Purnima has rightly raised with me ever since the first time we met: business rates. Nurseries need large buildings, even though in relative terms the value of your business may be low. I’ve been considering what I can do to help. So I’m pleased to be able to say that the government is, quite rightly, toughening up on local authorities. Today, at my request, DCLG will be writing to all councils reminding them of the importance of prompt payment to you and your businesses. I’ll also be urging them to work closely with you - to understand your business models and how they could provide further support. The letter will also remind your local authorities how valuable it is to apply business rates relief to nurseries - to help you out and encourage our growing and thriving sector. For councils that give this discount, central government will meet 50% of the costs involved. And I’ll also be writing personally to our early years contacts in councils - I want them to get talking to their finance colleagues, working together to deliver the best service to nurseries in their area. And I urge you to get talking to your local authorities too. Write to them yourselves, as I’ll be doing, and explain why business rates relief would make such a difference to your businesses. We’ve also recently published a benchmarking tool allowing providers like you to see how early years funding works in your area: how much money your councils keep, and how much makes its way to the front line. To nurseries, schools and, ultimately, to children. During a tough time of austerity, we’ve frozen funding rates for the early years sector - and I want to see that money continuing to reach the front line. I know that different local authorities treat money differently - with some giving considerably less to private practices. That’s why I’m serious about finding out where money goes, and how it’s being used. Now I know many of your concerns, detailed in this year’s survey, were about funding, budgets, pay, and the burden these can be on your businesses. Your staff costs can be considerable - frequently, the biggest cost to your business. Of course, it’s right that you spend a lot on staff, because without the right people you wouldn’t be able to provide the excellent care that so many of you do. And we know that businesses that reward staff well are the ones that retain the best people. That’s why the government supports businesses that choose to pay the living wage where it is affordable for them to do so and doesn’t come at the expense of jobs. But, fundamentally, you know your businesses best, and that’s why we’re leaving it up to you to decide how to attract and retain the best talent. As part of the government’s wider commitment to reduce the burden of regulation on all businesses, we’ve taken specific measures to reduce bureaucratic red tape around the planning and registration processes for nurseries, helping to support NDNA members to expand. And, of course, this government is spending £5 billion - rising to £6 billion - a year, on childcare, over the course of this Parliament. We’re working hard to make the current system simpler, and maximising the amount of money that actually reaches the front line. We’ve protected the amount of funding local authorities receive for 2-, 3- and 4-year-olds in their area for the next financial year. And tax-free childcare will see extra money going straight into the pockets of parents, increasing their purchasing power and boosting the finances of the childcare sector. Tax-free childcare expenditure is forecast to rise to £990 million per year by 2018 to 2019. All to ease the burdens on nurseries like yours. I also know that the NDNA is passionate about pedagogy. About learning from others. Doing things better and doing things differently. The government’s doing what it can to ease some of the financial pressures you experience, as small business owners, and we’re toughening up on local authorities, reiterating the support we expect them to provide. The majority of you say you’re planning to expand, and almost 50% report that you’re working in partnership with nearby schools. I’m delighted to hear that, because joined-up school and nursery provision can have so many benefits. It makes life easier for working parents, means children can access the help they need earlier on in life and helps to put education at the heart of the communities you serve. At the beginning of a new year, now’s the time to think differently, to think innovatively, about the care and education you provide your children, as you expand and increase your childcare offer, and continue to build relationships with schools. Like the 40 2-year-olds in Skelmersdale, Lancashire, who are receiving a great education due to a partnership between a local school and a private provider. And the nurseries around the country that are offering parents flexibility and increasing occupancy during holiday periods by delivering the 2-year-old entitlement across 50 or 51 weeks, rather than the more usual 38. And these are just a couple of examples of innovation making life easier for families, and helping you and your businesses to prosper. Thank you for all that you do. I hope you’re as optimistic about 2015 as I am."
/guidance/early-years-qualifications-finder,"Overview All providers working with children from birth to 5 years old must follow the regulations on qualified staff to child ratios. These regulations are set out in the statutory framework for the early years foundation stage ( EYFS ) . Providers must ensure staff have the appropriate qualifications to be counted in the ratios. Qualification requirements Check qualifications on our Early Years Qualifications List. The National College for Teaching and Leadership ( NCTL ) is responsible for defining the qualifications that staff included in the specified ratios must hold. Our Early Years Qualifications List is a searchable list of qualifications. Both providers and those wanting to work in an early years setting can use it to check qualifications and confirm if a person can be counted in the qualified staff to child ratios. Early years educators Early years educator qualifications were introduced in September 2014. They are qualifications at level 3 or above, approved by NCTL as meeting the early years educator criteria. If staff have an early years educator qualification they must also have at least a GCSE grade C in English and maths to undertake a level 3 job role. The position for staff holding full and relevant qualifications prior to the introduction of the early years educator criteria has not changed. They can still practice in level 3 job roles and do not need to hold GCSEs in English and maths. Early years apprenticeship An early years educator qualification can be completed by itself or as part of the Advanced Apprenticeship for the Children and Young People’s Workforce . The Advanced Apprenticeship for Children and Young People’s Workforce includes the new early years educator qualification and requires learners to achieve GCSEs English and maths at grade C or above on exit. The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills is working with groups of employers (Trailblazers) to develop and publish new apprenticeship standards for a range of sectors. This includes an early years apprenticeship standard . Find out more about apprenticeships . Contact us Use our contact us form if you have any queries."

The framework is flexible enough to accommodate a range of good early years practice, but there may be instances where a family’s religious or philosophical convictions cannot be reconciled with one or more of the learning and development requirements of the EYFS . For these cases there is a process available which enables early years providers to consider modifying or exempting one or more learning and development requirements for a child where their family requests it."

/government/publications/childcare-and-early-years-survey-of-parents-2009,"This report provides the main findings of the 2009 survey in the Childcare and Early Years Survey of Parents series. The survey series is funded by the Department for Education and has been carried out by the National Centre for Social Research since 2004. The survey has two main objectives. The first is to provide up-to-date and accurate information on parents’ childcare arrangements and their views of particular childcare providers and childcare provision in general. The second is to continue the time series and provide information to help monitor the progress of policies in the areas of childcare and early years education. The report describes in detail what childcare is used by different types of families, changes in take-up over the years, parents’ reasons for using or not using childcare and for choosing particular providers, and parents’ views on the providers they used and on childcare provision in their local area in general. Just over 6,700 parents in England with children under 15 were interviewed for the study, between June and December 2009. They were randomly selected from child benefit records. All the parents had children aged 14 and under, to be comparable with the previous surveys in the series and to focus on the age group most often included within government policy on childcare."

/government/speeches/edward-timpson-speaks-about-special-educational-needs-policy-reform-at-a-conference-organised-by-ambitious-about-autism,"Thanks, Robert (Buckland, MP, Chair) for the introduction - and the valuable contribution you and your colleagues on the All Party Parliamentary Group on Autism have made to our reforms to special educational needs (SEN). I’m grateful for the opportunity to discuss them with you here today. Thanks too to Ambitious about Autism for your positive and constructive engagement with these important changes. These, as you know, are currently going through Parliament as part of the Children and Families Bill. This has just been through the committee stage in the House of Commons, with the report stage and third reading to come. As your outstanding work at TreeHouse School shows, you know better than most what it takes to help children and young people with autism fulfil their potential. Which is why I so greatly value your input and that of other support groups, young people with autism and parents in shaping our reforms so that they really deliver for children and families living with the condition. But our reforms are as much about a change in culture as a change in law. The 20 local pathfinders we’ve set up are pivotal to this change. Over 700 families are involved in these across 31 local authorities. Helping not only test the reforms, so we get the law and regulations right, but, as your conference title says, turning policy into practice. Hearing what David (Nicholson, Youth Patron, Ambitious about Autism) and what the young people in the film had to say now, offers us a strong reminder of just what this means for children with autism. It’s clear that in cherishing hopes and dreams, they are no different from their peers. This sentiment also came across loud and clear when I met a very passionate group of parent bloggers, who have children with special educational needs, a few weeks ago. They put it well, when they said they only wanted for their children what we want for our own children – support to help them develop and thrive, so they can make the most of their talents - whatever that might be. Surely the least these families deserve, given the huge challenges they already face. Problems with the current system and the need for change Instead, too many found themselves, to quote one mother, in “an unending battle” with the system that’s supposed to help them. Too many found that their children’s special educational needs were picked up late. Too many had to fight to get different services to work together – services that focused too much on the SEN label rather than on meeting the child’s needs and supporting their life outcomes. And too many found that young people lost the protections and rights they had at school when they went on to further education. So, it’s little wonder that young people with SEN often have such poor prospects, lagging behind their peers at school and college and being more likely to be out of education, training and employment at 18. This is clearly unacceptable – a terrible waste of untapped potential and lives peppered by missed opportunities. Which is why we must work together to fundamentally transform the system, so that it fits in with the needs of children and young people with SEN rather than the other way around. Reforms in the bill The reforms in the Children and Families Bill aim to do just this – to create a clearer, more joined-up approach that’s more focused on outcomes and better supports transition to adulthood. Crucially, they’ll also do much more to involve children, young people and their families: through a more integrated, streamlined assessment process through a new birth to 25 Education, Health and Care Plan that sets out, in one place, all the support across services the child will receive through a local offer outlining what support is available to children with SEN and their families in their area and through joint commissioning of services by local authorities and local health bodies How the reforms benefit children with autism In doing so, we recognise that children and young people with autism can have particularly complex needs demanding intervention from a number of different agencies. So they should particularly benefit from the more joined-up approach in the Education, Health and Care Plan. Many children with autism also stand to gain from a stronger push for early identification of SEN through initiatives such as the two to two-and-a-half year health visitor review. We’re committed to creating an integrated review from 2015 combining the health visitor review and the two year old Early Years Foundation progress review. In addition, young people and parents will be able to opt for a personal budget, so they can have more choice and control over the support they or their child receives. Changes to the bill/supporting transition Now, as many of you will know, we’ve made a number of changes to the bill, having drawn on the views of children and young people with autism, parents and others in the field. Most, notably, we’ve clarified our commitment to maintaining and, indeed, extending, existing rights and protections. I hope this reassures parents, who’ve fought so hard for their children, about what these changes mean. The truth is that their children will be better off because, for the first time, comparable protections will be in place from birth right through school into further education and training. I know that one of the biggest frustrations young people with SEN and their families face is having to fight to get good information about what support’s available. So, we’ve made some changes to the local offer to make this easier. These will require local authorities to involve children, young people and parents in developing and reviewing the local offer. The local authority will also have to publish and respond to their comments about the local offer. It’s this direct input from families and local flexibility that will drive services to be truly responsive to needs on the ground. We’re also developing proposals to ensure families get coordinated information across education, health and social care as part of the joint commissioning of services. I’m conscious that transition from school to adulthood and independence also presents a huge challenge for young people with autism and other special educational needs. Which is why we’ve made progress in this area a priority through the new 0 to 25 system, which stretches support further than ever before. The focus on outcomes in the education, health and care plan, on what the child, young person and their family want to achieve in education, work and other areas, includes planning around key transition points. Provisions in the bill further strengthen this support after the age of 16 in a number of ways - by, for example, for the first time, giving young people up to the age of 25 the right to request an assessment for an education, health and care plan. Young people will also have the right to request that a particular college is named in their plan and to appeal against a decision made by the local authority at the tribunal. In addition, we amended the legislation – following representations from Ambitious About Autism and others during the pre-legislative scrutiny stage – to ensure that local authorities maintain plans for young people who are not in education, employment or training up until age 18. And for young people planning to leave education within 2 years, local authorities must ensure that the education, health and care plan looks ahead; that they set out clear transition plans, focused on outcomes, that help the young person progress successfully to adulthood. Change to a single SEN category/support for those without a Plan We’re keen to ensure that all children get the right support they need at the right time. Better identification of their needs is key. Which is why we recently contracted the Autism Education Trust to continue and expand its important work in this area; so the trust’s work to train staff in schools will now be extended to early years and further education. Better identification of need is also the spur for our proposals to replace the current school action/school action plus system with a new single SEN category. This is a simplified, rigorous approach that aims to focus the system on the impact of the support provided to the individual child rather than on how child accesses support. The changes, which will be set out in the new SEN code of practice, don’t change the legislative duties on schools. But they do challenge schools to improve the quality of teaching and learning for all pupils, rather than inappropriately and inaccurately labelling some pupils as having SEN. This drive to raise education standards and better prepare all children for adult life is underlined by our commitment to raise the participation age in education or training to 18. Supported internships However, we know that young people with autism can find it especially hard to find work. Which is why we’re trialling supported internships for young people with complex learning difficulties or disabilities, at 15 colleges around England. These are further education courses, based mainly with an employer, that provide young people with SEN with on-the-job training and support from expert job coaches. Similar programmes have already yielded some success stories. One young man called David, who is on the autistic spectrum, found a job in the catering department of the University of Surrey after taking part in an internship supported by the university, Guildford College and EmployAbility, a not-for-profit body that helps disabled students find work. The confidence he gained led him to taking on a role as a voluntary caterer at the Olympics. A fantastic example of how targeted support can go a long way towards helping young people with SEN become more independent. These are just the sort of outcomes that our reforms aim to achieve. But, as I’ve said before, it’s a shift in culture, above all, that’s needed to really transform support and aspiration for children with SEN and their families. Pathfinders Getting different services to work together and put the child and their family in the driving seat isn’t easy. But pathfinders, across the country are developing new systems with families at their heart, proving it can be done. In West Sussex, the SE7 has developed new arrangements based on early years multi-agency planning meetings. The 30 families who’ve been involved report that the new approach is proving much more supportive and responsive to their needs. Elsewhere, Medway has carried out single coordinated assessment for a small number of younger children and used a video play tool to bring parents and professionals together as part of the assessment process. They have also acted to make sure assessment reports and education, health and care plans are clear and jargon-free. As with those in West Sussex, parents and professionals are said to be delighted with this new approach which, they feel, truly puts the child at the heart of the process. Over 600 families now have a new education, health and care plan. These seem to be going down well - of the 65 families surveyed for an evaluation, the vast majority said they felt positive about the pathfinder process. I’ve seen for myself the difference the new plans are making on recent visits to pathfinders in Surrey and Bromley. I heard some really encouraging stories there from young people and their parents who said they felt much more involved in drawing up their package of support through the education, health and care plans. I also heard about some of the challenges we face in making sure elements of the reforms, like personal budgets and transitions into adulthood, are working as well as we would want. It seems, from what I’ve seen, that one of keys to success of the pathfinder work, is collaboration done in positive spirit - individuals and organisations being willing to work with others they haven’t worked with before, with a focus on what needs to be achieved and a plan, broken down into small steps, of how to get there. As I said last year, the pathfinders will continue until September 2014 so we can make the most of their experience Code of practice Their insights, along with the views of other interested parties, will inform a new shorter, clearer code of practice. This will provide practical guidance to professionals and families and will include, for the first time, information on post-16 and the further education sector. As you may know, we published an indicative draft of the code in March to support the committee’s scrutiny of the SEN clauses of the bill. As the name suggests, the draft is indicative of the government’s thinking and is not, I should stress, a final document. So there will be plenty of time to have a say on this during the passage of the Bill and when we consult publicly on a full draft of the code this autumn. Transition/implementation Learning from the pathfinders and others will also feed into our approach to transition as we move from the old to the new system. We want children and young people with SEN and their families to benefit from the improved arrangements as soon as possible, while at the same time ensuring that that the best possible service is maintained through transition. Our ambition, once the legislation comes into force, is to see all new assessments undertaken to be for new education, health and care plans. To ensure a smooth changeover, we believe a phased approach will be needed to transfer children and young people with existing statements and learning difficulty assessments to education, health and care plans. These changes will need very careful consideration and we’re gathering views from interested parties to find the best way forward. We’ll set out details of our preferred approach in a draft order which will be subject to formal consultation later this year. I’d like to reassure those worried that existing statements could lose their legal status during transition. I’m clear that existing statements and learning difficulty assessments will retain current legal rights until they’re replaced by education, health and care plans. Conclusion I want to work with you, as we’ve done on the bill, to make sure this transition period runs smoothly for all concerned, so that children and young people with SEN and their families can benefit from our reforms as soon as possible - and when I say our reforms, I hope, very much, that you will also see them as your reforms. Because you all have a significant role to play in making them a reality on the ground. Now, I know that change can be daunting, especially when it involves vulnerable children and change to a system that’s gone largely untouched for three decades. But we have a real opportunity here to make a difference. By extending support into adulthood, getting services working together and providing better information, these reforms have the potential to transform thousands of young lives and those of their families. Indeed, given the complex nature of autism, our success in improving support and outcomes for children with the condition can be seen as a test of the reforms. But to make them a reality, we need you, as trusted groups, individuals and leaders, to help explain these changes and ensure children with SEN and their families fully benefit from them. We’re keen to support you in this, which is why I’m pleased that we’ll be continuing to support Ambitious about Autism over the next two years through our grants programme. I know that you are planning to work with the Association of Colleges and some mainstream colleges on innovative ways of helping young people with autism make the transition from school to college. I’ll be very interested to hear about the progress you make. I’m optimistic that, by working together in this way, we can build a better system that’s truly on the side of those depend on it. A system that, as one of the parent bloggers put it, “sees my son as the funny, smart little boy I see. The little boy who deserves to have people who are there to help him driven to do their very best so he has as many opportunities as other children.” That’s what I want to see. And I know it’s what you want. Let’s work together to make it happen. Thank you."

/guidance/2016-early-years-foundation-stage-assessment-and-reporting-arrangements-ara/section-2-early-years-foundation-stage-profile,"##2.1 Overview of the EYFS profileThe [‘EYFS profile handbook’](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-years-foundation-stage-profile-handbook) contains detailed information on the background and purpose of the EYFS profile. It also explains how practitioners should complete the profile. Headteachers should make sure those involved in assessing the EYFS have a thorough understanding of the handbook. ##2.2  Completing the EYFS profilePractitioners must complete the EYFS profile for each pupil who will be 5 years old on or before Wednesday 31 August 2016 unless:*	the Secretary of State has granted an exemption from the profile for the setting *	the pupil  is continuing in EYFS provision beyond the year in which they turn 5*	the pupil has arrived from abroad less than 2 weeks before the profile submission deadline and so an accurate and valid assessment can’t be completed*	the pupil has spent the majority of the academic year away from the setting, for example, due to illness or medical treatmentPractitioners should make profile judgements on the basis of cumulative observational evidence recorded over the course of the year. Profile summaries must be completed no later than Friday 1 July 2016.##2.3 Data collection and submissionEYFS providers may use any secure system to collect and submit EYFS profile data, as long as practitioners can record completed profile data for every pupil at the end of the EYFS. EYFS providers should agree a preferred system with their local authority (LA). This is available on request from the department and can be obtained by contacting the Data Collections Helpdesk using the [Service Request Form.](https://www.education.gov.uk/researchandstatistics/stats/requestform)###National data submissionThe following table sets out the requirements for submission of EYFS profile data and contextual pupil data to LAs and the Department for Education (DfE).Status of pupil and setting|Is submission of data to LA statutory?|Is LA submission to DfE statutory?|-|-Pupil in a maintained school|yes|yes|Pupil in EYFS provision who is in receipt of government funding in the 2016 summer term|yes|yes|Pupil in EYFS provision who is not in receipt of government funding in the 2016 summer term|yes where requested by LA|no|Pupil in an academy|yes|yes|Pupil in an independent school which is in receipt of government funding in the 2016 summer term|yes|yes|Pupil in an independent school which is not in receipt of government funding in the 2016 summer term|yes where requested by LA|no|Pupil with a registered childminder (for the majority of the time they spend within EYFS provision between 8am and 6pm|yes where required by LA - or if the pupil is in receipt of government funding in the 2016 summer term|no unless pupil in receipt of government funding in the 2016 summer termPupil in an independent EYFS provision where the setting has EYFS exemption|yes on a voluntary basis|noPupil being educated at home|no unless on the register of a maintained/independent school and/or in receipt of government funding|no unless on the register of a maintained/independent school and/or in receipt of government funding|The pupil’s name is not required from settings which are not in receipt of government funding. The LA is only required to submit data to the DfE for pupils who receive government funding in the 2016 summer term.The DfE will send full details of the data submission arrangements to LAs in early 2016. Settings and LAs are encouraged to return data to the DfE on a voluntary basis to help produce a full picture of pupils’ attainment.##2.4 Data specificationAssessment rating|EYFS judgement|-|-1|Indicates a pupil who is at the ‘emerging’ level at the end of the EYFS| 2|Indicates a pupil who is at the ‘expected’ level at the end of the EYFS| 3|Indicates a pupil who is at the ‘exceeding’ level at the end of the EYFS|A|Indicates a pupil who has not been assessed due to long periods of absence, for instance a prolonged illness; a pupil who arrives too late in the summer term for teacher assessment to be carried out ie within 2 weeks of the data submission date; or a pupil who has an exemption|## 2.5 Exceptions###Exemptions from the assessment arrangementsAll EYFS settings must participate in the assessment arrangements outlined in this ARA, unless the Secretary of State has [granted an exemption](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-early-years-foundation-stage-eyfs-learning-and-development-requirements-guidance-on-exemptions-for-early-years-providers) If an exemption is granted for an individual pupil then this should be recorded as ‘A’ for each early learning goal (ELG) in their profile return.###Alternative assessmentsThe EYFS profile is an inclusive assessment. It can capture a wide range of pupils’ learning and development outcomes. Despite this, practitioners might find the observation and assessment of some pupils particularly challenging. If a pupil is given an outcome of ‘emerging’, it might not provide the full picture about that pupil’s learning and development at the end of the EYFS. In these cases, extra information should be considered alongside EYFS profile judgements. This will ensure that conversations with key stage 1 staff are meaningful and help the pupil to make a successful transition. There may be cases where it is not appropriate to make a judgement against an assessment scale, for instance if the pupil has recently arrived from abroad. In these cases, practitioners must use ‘A’ (for no assessment) when they submit the data to their LA. ###Pupils who remain in EYFS provision beyond the age of 5The expectation is that pupils will move with their peers so they will only be assessed once for the EYFS profile. In exceptional circumstances, after discussion and in agreement with parents, a pupil might remain in EYFS provision beyond the end of the academic year in which he or she reaches the age of 5. Providers should take care to make sure this decision does not prejudice the pupil’s personal, social and emotional development.In these exceptional cases, assessment should continue throughout the pupil’s time within EYFS provision. An EYFS profile should be completed only once at the end of the year before the pupil moves into key stage 1.The setting should discuss their intention to defer the pupil’s statutory assessment with their LA EYFS profile moderation manager. This will ensure the pupil’s data is not considered missing when the setting submits EYFS profile outcomes for the current cohort. Care should be taken when entering the pupil’s EYFS profile assessment into any electronic recording system. The pupil’s date of birth may now be outside the expected range for the cohort. LAs should give settings instructions in such cases. The DfE will consider the pupil to be part of this new cohort, and will accept data submitted in this way. The DfE may check the accuracy of the dates of birth of individual pupils with the relevant LA.*[EYFS]: early years foundation stage *[DfE]: Department for Education*[SCE]: Service Children’s Education*[LA]: local authority*[LAs]: local authorities"

The release shows attainment by pupil characteristics, specifically gender, ethnicity, eligibility for free school meals (FSM), special educational needs (SEN) and English as a first language. The figures contained within this publication combine the information gathered through the school census in January 2011 and the 2011 early years foundation stage profile teacher assessments. This statistical release was published on 1 December 2011 and updates the release of 16 December 2010. The key points from this release are: The percentage of children achieving a good level of development in 2011 was 59% compared to 56% in 2010. Between 2010 and 2011, the percentage of pupils achieving a good level of development increased for all broad groupings of pupils, regardless of gender, ethnicity, FSM eligibility, SEN stage or first language. Girls outperformed boys with 68% of girls achieving a good level of development compared to 50% of boys. Looking at the broad ethnicity groupings in 2011, the proportion of groups of pupils who achieved a ‘good level of development’ above the national average were those from white (60%) and mixed (60%) backgrounds. The groups that achieved below the national average were those from black (55%) Asian (55%) and Chinese (58%) backgrounds. A higher proportion (60%) of pupils whose first language is English achieved a good level of development compared with pupils whose first language was other than English (52%). 44% of pupils eligible for free school meals (FSM) achieved a good level of development compared with 62% of other pupils (those not eligible for free school meals or unclassified). Underlying data and pupil residency based tables showing a breakdown of attainment by pupil characteristics will be added in January 2012. Note: We are considering publishing the EYFSP attainment by pupil characteristics results in a joint publication in 2012 with the summary national- and local authority-level results as published in October 2011. This would mean some revisions to the timings of both publications but would result in one statistical first release (SFR). If you have comments on this proposed change please contact Sally Marshall.

/government/speeches/sarah-teather-article-in-nursery-world-on-the-spending-review,"I’m sure you all watched with interest the Chancellor’s Spending Review announcement on Wednesday. I wanted to use this opportunity to talk frankly about what the Spending Review means for the early learning and childcare sector. I know that many of you will be understandably anxious about how the government’s savings will impact on the early years. I hope this week’s announcement has allayed some of those concerns. The Spending Review inevitably involved some very difficult decisions, but in making savings the Government has done everything we can to protect frontline services, help the most disadvantaged and accelerate social mobility. Supporting families and the most vulnerable in our society is at the heart of our vision for transforming early education. We know that high-quality, accessible early education is vital so we can give every child the foundation they need to succeed and parents can balance work and family life. That’s why the Deputy Prime Minister last week confirmed that we have protected funding for free nursery education for 3- and 4-year-olds - and a new fairness fund will include £300 million to extend 15 hours per week of free education to all disadvantaged 2-year-olds. Investing in young children is investing in the long term. We know from research that the gap in achievement begins as early as 22 months - disadvantaged children begin to fall behind and are overtaken by children from more affluent backgrounds. The fairness fund will offer more help at an earlier age to the most disadvantaged children and will mean we can directly tackle the gaps in attainment that open up in the critical early years of life. I want to make sure we give every child a fair start in life and Sure Start centres are in a unique position to help us achieve this. The Chancellor confirmed in the Spending Review that Sure Start funding will be protected in cash terms, including investment in health visitors. However, even at this level, with greater numbers of children coming through and other grants coming to an end, I realise that this will feel tough. So while there is funding to keep the network of Sure Start centres as a universal service, local authorities and children’s centres will need to work together to make savings and think more innovatively about how they use their resources. In doing so the focus must now be on how we can enable Sure Start centres, working with other professionals, to better target those most in need of their services. We want to see children’s centres intervening earlier and taking a much more innovative approach. This means focusing on services that really work, and involving organisations who have a track record of supporting families effectively. We also want to see a much stronger partnership with local communities and voluntary organisations, so that all children’s centres become hubs of Big Society - a place for parents of all backgrounds to meet and share experiences, build their confidence and get involved in their local community. Much of what the Chancellor set out in the Spending Review involves us all thinking in a radically different way about how services are delivered at a local level. By removing ring fences on funding and the creation of a new Early Intervention grant, we are giving local authorities more flexibility and freedom over how they design services that truly meet the needs of the communities they serve. We know there are difficult times ahead, but I want you to be reassured that the Spending Review shows that the Government remains firmly committed to giving our children and families the services, help and support they need to thrive. Families are the bedrock of a strong and stable society, and getting things right early on makes sense in the long term - for Government, families and the wider community."
/government/news/teather-parents-should-have-a-greater-say-in-their-childrens-centre,"Parents and communities should be able to have a greater say in running their local children’s centre, Children’s Minister Sarah Teather said today (24 May 2012). The government is seeking views on how to encourage groups of parents, families and community members to get involved in the planning and delivery of early education services. Evidence shows that empowering parents through involving them in the planning and delivery of Sure Start services can lead to better outcomes for families. The government also invited expressions of interest from groups of parents who are interested in setting up their own community body so that they can bid to run their local children’s centre. The department announced it will procure an organisation to provide advice and guidance to help a number of groups to develop and test their proposals. Local authorities will still have the final say on whether bids are successful. Speaking at the Daycare Trust’s London Childcare Providers’ Forum, Sarah Teather said: It is important that children’s centres are at the heart of community life and we are committed to maintaining a strong and effective national network of centres across the country. I want to make sure they are delivering the best service possible to their local community. That’s why we want to hear views and new ideas on how parents and communities can help run children’s centres. I believe this will give local people more control and influence over the services they use. Many children’s centres already involve parents and their local community and now we want to build on this to find ways of enabling them to have a stronger voice in how they are run and what they can offer. The discussion paper on parental involvement was published today ahead of a new right coming into force later this year called the ‘Community right to challenge’. Notes to editors Case studies of parent and community involvement. Millmead Children’s centre in Margate, Kent is run by a community mutual, commissioned by the local authority. Local parents and families, as well as staff working at the centre, can become members of the Community Mutual for a nominal fee and this enables them to become more involved in deciding how the centre is run. The centre currently has around 30 volunteers contributing in a variety of ways, from assisting in the running of groups, to being involved in service reviews, planning, food production at the allotments, being representatives on interview panels and the action group where their views are heard. Westgate Children’s Centre in Morecombe helped to develop an Empowering Parents Group for younger parents, which has been running since 2008. Many parents joining the group are unemployed and often do not have many qualifications or much work experience. The course is now available in eight other centres in Lancashire. The Department for Education plans to put in place some support a small number of groups to develop proposals to set up their own community body so that they could bid to run their local children’s centre. There will be no direct funding for projects. The support will take the form of advice and guidance to help groups develop and test their proposals. Local authorities will have the final say on whether bids are successful. The deadline for responses to the children’s centres discussion paper and expressions of interest from prospective community groups is 19 July 2012. Draft statutory guidance on Sure Start children’s centres , which sets out what local authorities should do when setting up or overseeing the management of children’s centres, is currently out for consultation. The closing date for responses is 1 June. The Localism Act 2011 has given voluntary and community groups, local authority employees who wish to form a public service mutual, and parish councils the Community Right to Challenge their local authority by expressing an interest in providing services on behalf of the authority. This can include provision of children’s centres. The right to challenge provisions are expected to come into effect on 27 June 2012, subject to parliamentary approval. Draft statutory guidance on the community right to challenge was published by the Department for Communities and Local Government on 21 May 2012.

/government/news/call-for-evidence-for-the-review-of-the-early-years-foundation-stage,"Dame Clare Tickell is today launching a call for evidence to inform her independent review of the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS). Announced on 6 July 2010, the EYFS review is looking at how best to protect young children’s safety and welfare and support their development and learning. Speaking about the call for evidence Dame Clare said: I hope those with a passion for Early Years education take the opportunity to respond to this call for evidence. I want to hear from parents, professionals, carers and other Early Years experts about their experiences and views on the EYFS. I particularly want to hear from those who are delivering the EYFS on a regular basis and can advise on where we could make improvements. These views will help shape the future of the EYFS and will be invaluable in helping me to identify the best parts of the EYFS, as well as the parts that may have to change. I look forward to hearing from you. The review will cover four main areas: scope of regulation - whether there should be one single framework for all Early Years providers learning and development - looking at the latest evidence about children’s development and what is needed to give them the best start at school assessment - whether young children’s development should be formally assessed at a certain age, and what this should cover welfare - the minimum standards to keep children safe and support their healthy development. The call for evidence runs from 2 August to 30 September 2010 and can be accessed on the Department’s consultations website. Dame Clare will provide a final report on the EYFS review in spring 2011. The Government will then consult on any proposed changes before they take effect from September 2012. [Contact:997]"
/government/news/all-schools-to-list-childcare-options,"The information will include what childcare is on offer in primary and secondary schools: ranging from full-time nurseries to holiday and after-school provision. This important step-change will support parents to make the best childcare decisions for their families and help them to access their 15 hours of free childcare per week for 3- and 4-year-olds with one simple click. Childcare Minister Sam Gyimah said: Getting the right childcare is one of the most important decisions any parent makes - we want to make it easier for families to find and access as many high-quality options as simply as possible. A lot of schools are offering this valuable support, but parents shouldn’t have to click through 7 pages of a website to find out about it. I want to save parents from that headache and help to put them in touch with the right provider for their family. All 3- and 4-year-olds now have free childcare of 15 hours per week in settings that include schools. Forty per cent of 2-year-olds from less well-off backgrounds can also access this free funding. As well as improving choice, the quality of childcare available will also be boosted by an announcement today (23 March 2015) that Teach First is expanding the number of places on their early years programme. This expansion of Teach First reflects strong recruitment for 2015 to 2016 and clear demand for places beyond that originally planned. Notes to editors Information on schools’ childcare will be gathered by the department and their performance tables will be updated with this information from next year. The provision of childcare will not be included in the assessment of a school’s performance. We are supporting Teach First to increase the number of Early Years trainees it recruits for 2015 to 2016 from 38 to 82. The government is also working with digital developers to create a new website or app to provide a one-stop-shop for parents in finding childcare arrangements . Recent Ipsos MORI research showed parents are unsure where to find information and often unaware of the full childcare provision in their area. [Contact:997]"
/government/speeches/nick-gibb-the-importance-of-phonics,"In To Kill a Mockingbird, after being scolded by her teacher for knowing how to read before she has been taught at school, 6-year-old Scout is consoled by her brother. Jem explains: Don’t worry… Our teacher says Miss Caroline’s introducing a new way of teaching. She learned about it in college. It’ll be in all the grades soon. You don’t have to learn much out of books that way - it’s like if you wanta learn about cows, you go milk one, see? Jem continues: I’m just trying to tell you the new way they’re teachin’ the first grade, stubborn. It’s the Dewey Decimal System. Scout goes on to reflect that: The Dewey Decimal System consisted, in part, of Miss Caroline waving cards at us on which were printed ‘the,’ ‘cat,’ ‘rat,’ ‘man,’ and ‘you.’ No comment seemed to be expected of us, and the class received these impressionistic revelations in silence. While Jem may be confusing the Dewey Decimal library classification system with John Dewey, the progressive educationalist, Harper Lee is of course satirising the ideology that gripped the US (and then, alas the UK ) education system particularly from the mid-20th century onwards. Confidence in direct instruction was lost and replaced with a misguided belief in children’s ability to discover knowledge for themselves. One aspect of this was a move away from systematically teaching children to read through phonics and the introduction of learning to read by looking at words - what we all know now as ‘look and say’. It took Rudolf Flesch and his seminal book Why Johnny Can’t Read to call into question this approach in the 1950s. As Flesch wrote in the introduction to the book: Do you know that the teaching of reading never was a problem anywhere in the world until the United States switched to the present method around about 1925? He continued: ever since 1500 BC people all over the world - wherever an alphabetic system of writing was used - learned how to read and write by the simple process of memorising the sound of each letter in the alphabet. The success of phonics versus ‘look and say’ has been contested since and that is why it’s so important that we are here today. I am grateful to the Reading Reform Foundation for convening this discussion and for your work advancing phonics in the UK since the late 1980s. I would also like to take the opportunity to thank all of the experts in this field who continue to contribute to the debate in support of phonics and who have taught me so much over the last 10 years - Ruth Miskin, Jennifer Chew, Sue Lloyd, Debbie Hepplewhite and Marlynne Grant to name but a few. What I came to appreciate from you and from my experiences is the importance of teaching reading. This was highlighted to me on many occasions but one which stands out was a visit to a primary school in 2009 where I observed a one-to-one reading lesson with a girl in her last year of primary school, aged 11. The teacher showed the pupil simple words on flashcards, but the girl struggled with most of them. When she managed the word ‘even’, I asked if she could still read the word with the first ‘e’ covered up; she could not. The problem was clear. For the same reason that “Johnny couldn’t read … for the simple reason that nobody ever showed him how”, this girl could not read because she had never been taught to read. Instead, she had been drilled to recognise the word ‘even’. Sadly, this case was not an anomaly. Too many other pupils had similar experiences and expectations that were set far too low. In 2010, 1 in 5 children left primary school unable to read at the expected standard and 1 in 11 children left primary school with a reading ability no better than would be expected of a 7-year-old. This was inexcusable. Poor literacy disadvantages young people during the course of their education and continues to hold them back throughout adult life. The OECD Survey of Adult Skills published in 2013 showed that unemployed adults are twice as likely to have poor level of literacy as those who are in full-time employment. In their summary of England and Northern Ireland’s results, the OECD highlighted the fact that England was the only country that participated in the survey where young adults did not have better literacy skills than those approaching retirement age. It is also concerning that the UK ranked 47th out of 65 OECD countries on a measure of the number of young people who read for enjoyment. Six out of 10 teenagers in the UK regularly read for pleasure, compared to levels as high as 90% in countries like Kazakhstan, Albania, China and Thailand. The difference in reading ability between those pupils who never read for enjoyment, and those who read for even half an hour a day, is equivalent to a whole year of schooling at age 15. That is why the initiatives we announced on World Book Day earlier this month to encourage reading for pleasure - from book clubs to library membership - are so important. But to address the root cause of these challenges, the effective teaching of reading in our schools is crucial. In government, as we have delivered far-reaching reforms to our education system, we have made sure that these are grounded firmly in evidence. And with regard to the effective teaching of reading and raising standards of literacy, a substantial body of evidence shows that systematic synthetic phonics is the most effective way to teach all children to read, and that’s why we changed the national curriculum to make the requirements for phonics clearer. To quote one report from the Australian National Inquiry into the Teaching of Literacy: The evidence is clear […] that direct systematic instruction in phonics during the early years of schooling is an essential foundation for teaching children to read. […] Moreover, where there is unsystematic or no phonics instruction, children’s literacy progress is significantly impeded, inhibiting their initial and subsequent growth in reading accuracy, fluency, writing, spelling and comprehension. We have made significant progress, with an increasing number of schools recognising that phonics teaching is the most effective approach. The new national curriculum, introduced in September last year highlights the importance of phonic knowledge and the decoding of words. Between 2011 and 2013, the government provided match funding to schools for phonics training and resources. More than 14,000 schools benefited from the £23.7 million we made available. We have published core criteria for effective phonics programmes and the catch up premium, worth £500 per pupil, also supports secondary schools to support pupils who did not attain level 4 or above in reading at the end of key stage 2. I would like to thank Gordon Askew for all the work he did in that period to support the department. One of the most important developments has been the introduction of the phonics screening check for pupils at the end of year 1 in 2012. The check measures how many of 40 words and non-words pupils can decode successfully and helps to identify who may need further support. In 2012, 58% of pupils taking the check met the national standard. In 2013, it was 69% and by 2014, the proportion of pupils meeting the standard had risen to 74%: equivalent to 102,000 more 6-year-old children on track to read more effectively. These results are encouraging. In 611 primary schools, some in the most deprived parts of the country, at least 95% of pupils met the expected standard in 2014, and many schools have recognised the positive impact the teaching of phonics has on reading and literacy. For example, Ark academy chain has set itself a target of “100% of pupils being proficient early readers” and in 2014 2 Ark schools achieved a 100% success rate - Ark Conway and Ark Globe. I have seen some of the strengths of the Ark approach for myself. On a recent visit to Ark Priory Primary in Ealing, I was impressed that the year 1 pupils were reading novels such as Horrid Henry. Despite the improvements that have been made, there is significant disparity between local authorities, with some achieving a success rate of more than 81% in 2014 - from Darlington and Harrow to Solihull, and others not reaching even 70% - including Derby, Leicester, Norfolk and Nottingham. Additionally, children who do not meet the national standard in year 1 retake the check at the end of year 2 and in 2014, 12% of pupils had still not met the expected standard of decoding by the end of year 2 - 71,000 children. That is why we are determined to do more. The Phonics Partnership Grant Programme, announced in February, will see 12 to 15 networks established. Led by schools excelling at phonics teaching, the groups will work across schools to improve the quality of phonics teaching. Given the value of the phonics screening check as a diagnostic tool to identify whether pupils need further support, this week we said that we will run a pilot to extend the retake to year 3. This will be a voluntary pilot working with 300 schools, including some junior schools. Year 3 pupils will retake the check if they have not achieved the expected standard at the end of year 2 in summer 2015 (having initially taken the check at the end of year 1 in 2014). I hope this pilot will help us to understand why pupils still do not meet the standard, and the kind of support and interventions schools offer pupils who don’t meet the standard by the end of year 2. I am confident that the pilot will help us to further develop our evidence-based approach to policy-making and the successful implementation of teaching phonics in schools. With success in the basics of decoding words, pupils will be able to move on to reading with increased fluency and speed, which will enable them to develop a love of reading for pleasure and the habit of reading for pleasure. At key stage 2 I want us to reach a position where every child is routinely reading 5 children’s books a month. In short, we will continue to champion the importance of what could not be a more worthwhile objective: fluent reading Thank you."

/government/speeches/early-years-teachers-what-do-they-offer,"Thank you very much for inviting me today. I am delighted to be here. Staff working in the early years workforce do a remarkable and essential job educating and caring for babies and young children. I want to talk to you about the early years teacher training programme, why I think it has been successful, and to encourage you to work with us further to drive up standards within the sector. Ninety per cent of the success of any business is a result of the quality of the staff, and nurseries and day care are no different. When I was a headteacher, the most effective part of my special school was the nursery. Not because of what I did, but because it was run by a brilliant practitioner, Helen Rees. The progress of the early years teacher training programme We have come a long way in a short time since the introduction of the Early Years Professional Status in 2006 and change has been rapid. Eight years ago there was no specialist graduate leadership in early years, no early years professionals and no early years teachers. I am delighted we now have over 15,000 graduates who have successfully completed their specialist training and are able to work as early years teachers, making a difference to young children. This investment in graduate leadership in early years is a huge achievement by everyone involved – trainees, training providers and employers who encouraged their staff to undertake the training and who have also chosen to employ early years teachers. The early years workforce is becoming better qualified with an increasing number of graduates in the system. Forty-two per cent of providers now have teaching staff with either qualified teacher status ( QTS ) or Early Years Professional Status, working directly with 3 and 4 year-olds - up from 32% in 2009. Graduate leadership in early years has developed rapidly. The introduction of early years teachers in 2013 built on the achievements of the Early Years Professional Status programme. We introduced new teachers’ standards for early years which lead to the award of early years teacher status. For September 2014, for the first time, the entry requirements are exactly the same as those required to enter primary teacher training. This includes successful completion of the professional skills tests in literacy and numeracy. From this September early years teacher training is being delivered exclusively by accredited providers who deliver initial teacher training leading to QTS . We want more young children to have the support of an early years teacher, but we know that many providers find it challenging to find the money and the time to support their graduate staff to go onto this next level. To help employers to train an early years teacher, we have introduced funding of £14,000 for each trainee on the employment-based route. This funding is for the training course fees of up to £7,000, with the rest being used by the employer to contribute to supply cover, salary or other support. For eligible trainees who are not currently employed there are also bursaries paid at the same rate as those for primary teacher training. We also brought in School Direct to the early years for the first time this September. School Direct was introduced to give schools more control over the training and development of their workforce. We now want nurseries and schools to become more involved in training the next generation of early years teachers. A nursery can become a lead organisation and partner with a university or other training provider to deliver early years teacher training. The nursery recruits the trainees, provides placements and can tailor the training to its own needs. This is a great opportunity for nurseries and schools to help train early years teachers of the future and I will say more about this later. So what are the benefits of employing an early years teacher I believe early years teachers bring huge benefits: Firstly and most importantly early years teachers make a difference for young children. The evidence is clear that teacher-led provision leads to better outcomes for children. The Graduate Leader Fund research in 2011 showed nurseries with a leader with Early Years Professional Status made significant improvements in quality for pre-school children. More recently, research led by Sandra Mathers for the Nuffield Foundation looked at provision for disadvantaged 3 and 4 year olds and showed that where private, voluntary and independent providers ( PVIs ) employ graduates, quality is higher and the quality gap between settings in disadvantaged and more affluent areas is narrower. This research makes the case for increasing the number of early years teachers a compelling one. High-quality pre-school is especially beneficial for the most disadvantaged children. There is a shocking vocabulary gap of up to 19 months between the most disadvantaged children and their better off peers by the time they arrive at school. This gap remains hard to close throughout their schooling. Ofsted reports the stark fact that more than one third of children start school without sufficient communication, language and literacy skills. This proportion can rise to almost half of children in poorer areas. Early years teachers are helping to change these statistics. A couple of weeks ago I visited Pear Trees Day Nursery in Chelmsford, one of the Seymour House chain of nurseries which have all been rated Outstanding by Ofsted. The nursery employs an early years teacher and also a trainee teacher. The staff spoke passionately about the benefits of early years teachers for children. The trainee teacher, Natasha, had a law degree but chose to train as an early years teacher because she wants to inspire and encourage children to enjoy learning, give them the best start possible and move them successfully on to school. This is not unusual, as we know that many trainees have changed careers as they know working with babies and young children is a rewarding and challenging career. Bright Horizons have recently recruited 5 graduate trainees from a wide range of backgrounds – the law, immigration and border control, elder care management and customer services for Marks and Spencer and Debenhams. What these career-changers all had in common was the desire to make a difference for young children. Secondly, early years teachers make a difference to the nursery team. Carol Hedditch-Grey, the manager of Pear Trees, talked passionately about the impact of early years teachers and how they have inspired team members and acted as fantastic role models. Many other nurseries describe the enthusiasm, skills and expertise that early years teachers bring to their settings. Thirdly, early years teachers make a difference for parents, who all want what is best for their child. Parents should expect the highest quality. They recognise and understand the title of teacher and are likely to have more confidence in a team of high-quality staff educating and caring for their children. Finally, early years teachers help boost the status of the early years workforce. There is now one title of teacher across the early years and schools. Over time, this will influence the perception of parents, colleagues in the wider children’s workforce and society as a whole, and improve the professional identity of the workforce. What then are the challenges? These are strong benefits for employing an early years teacher. But I understand that this is not without its challenges and some of you will be thinking: What about pay and conditions – if the entry requirements are the same as primary teacher training and the training and standards are as rigorous, why aren’t early years teachers paid the same as primary school teachers? All the changes we have made are to raise quality and to promote the status of early years teacher in the education system. However the Government cannot set pay and conditions for all early years providers. I think it would go down very badly if we tried to tell private businesses in the PVI sector what to pay their staff and what conditions of service to offer. Others will be thinking: Why can’t early years teachers have QTS ? – this is a well-rehearsed debate and I know not all of you will support our position on this. The simple answer is that QTS can only be given to those who can demonstrate they meet the Teachers’ Standards. Early years teacher training is the only teacher training focussed on the birth to 5 age range and the Teachers’ Standards for Early Years were specifically designed for this age group. These standards are just as rigorous as the Teachers’ Standards, but they focus on teaching and supporting childhood development in the early years foundation stage. The Department for Education is not minded to change this position so the focus now must be on making the case for early years teachers as a profession, with robust standards, making a significant difference to the lives of children. I also believe employers have a big role to play: We want more young children to have the support of an early years teacher and I know many of you have been supportive of this approach. We have some way to go before all young children have access to a graduate teacher. So employers have a big role to play in improving the quality of the workforce – developing talent and growing their own staff. Almost 50% of the training places are for graduates who are already employed in early years settings and we would encourage employers to take advantage of the increased training funding available and support graduates to apply for the training. We also want more nurseries and schools to become involved in School Direct and on 3 November 2014 we published a tender, for the second year, to select lead organisations who want to support this innovative new approach. I am really grateful to those of you here today who are advertising and promoting this opportunity. Please do take a look at the tender and respond by 1 December 2014 if you are interested. Bright Horizons already have a number of early years professionals and early years teachers working in their organisation. We are very pleased that they are taking part in the first year of School Direct (early years), pioneering and testing the approach for the PVI sector. When they were asked if they would be interested in testing the School Direct approach and become involved in recruiting and training the best graduates to become the very best early years teachers, their response was, “why would we not?” In a short space of time they recruited 5 exceptional graduates. They developed a partnership with Kingston University, who embraced the idea of working with the private sector. For both parties it was a leap into the unknown that required a relationship of trust and openness. Training with Bright Horizons gives trainees the reassurance of a job on gaining their early years teacher status and a world of opportunity within the organisation; training with Kingston University gives them access to inspiring tutors, a world class university experience and a Master of Arts ( MA ) pathway. I would now like to invite Kate Hobbs, Nursery Manager at Bright Horizons Acorns Nursery in Surrey to share her experience with you. Kate talks for 5 minutes. Thank you Kate Early years in the self-improving school led system As well as improving the quality of the workforce we also want early years providers and schools to work more closely together and support quality improvement locally. My aim is for the National College for Teaching and Leadership ( NCTL ) to support the development of a world-class birth to 18 education system that is led by the best schools and early years providers. We must break down and challenge the divides that can exist. The more schools and early years providers are able to collaborate and work together, the better the outcomes for children. I know that many of you find it difficult to meet the costs of continuing professional development ( CPD ) for staff – partnerships both with schools and with other providers can help to increase purchasing power. There are already 400 early years specialist leaders of education, along with a growing number of teaching schools and alliances where early years providers are strategic partners. These teaching schools and alliances are already developing opportunities for joint CPD and practice development. Teaching schools are central to the delivery of the government’s vision for a self-improving school led system. They are outstanding in their own performance and have a track record of working with others to raise standards for children beyond their own school. Maintained nursery schools are already engaged in this vision. Nineteen nursery schools are designated as teaching schools and over 100 more are formally linked into teaching school alliances, many have strong links with their local PVI settings and child-minders. This number increases still further when we include schools with registered nursery provision, to over 100 teaching schools and over 1,000 more formally linked into alliances. Last month I visited Tanglewood nursery and teaching school that has a specialism in language development. Tanglewood has been reaching out to local PVI settings and helping them to support children with low-level language skills. School and PVI partnerships are already happening on the ground as professionals know that it makes sense to work together to support children in their community. But there is much more to do to strengthen this. Twenty teaching schools are testing and developing models to build on their existing alliances and increase early years engagement. To accelerate this partnership approach, in September 2014, £5 million was announced to support early years quality improvement. This is a great opportunity for teaching schools and PVIs to work together to improve provision, particularly the quality of provision accessed by disadvantaged children. We have received over 140 expressions of interest for this money with some exciting ideas to overcome challenges in local areas. The introduction of the early years pupil premium next April is another opportunity to consider innovative ways of working in partnership, perhaps by using this additional funding to employ an early years teacher or pooling funding to share an early years teacher between settings. I am convinced that partnership and collaboration is the way forward to improve quality for children. We need to consider what more we can do to support early years providers to become an integral part of a birth to 18 education system with schools and nursery settings supporting and learning from each other. We want early years teachers and leaders to be part of this vision as they will play an essential part in working with others towards achieving a world class, birth to 18 system. I understand the challenges for PVIs and nurseries, but I am also in no doubt that we have the best workforce in the sector that we have ever had. And with your support, commitment and determination we will reach the highest possible standards for all young children in this country."

/government/news/35-new-free-schools-providing-more-than-22000-places-announced,"Education Secretary Nicky Morgan has today approved 35 new free school applications, creating more than 22,000 additional school places for children across England. Establishing new schools is a vital part of the government’s plan for education - boosting choice for parents and helping drive up standards across the board. The announcement comes as a survey published today (30 September 2014) reveals the positive impact free school headteachers say their schools are having on raising the standard of education in neighbouring schools. The representative survey shows how free schools are bringing new ideas and approaches to education: 84% of free schools are collaborating with neighbouring schools, or plan to do so 72% of headteachers say they are having a positive impact on schools in their local area - often by competition or collaboration two-thirds offer an alternative to the national curriculum in some or all subjects around half have an extended school day Education Secretary Nicky Morgan said: Thanks to our plan for education more children in England have the opportunity to go to a good or outstanding school than ever before and free schools have been crucial to that change - with more than two-thirds of free schools meeting this high standard. We are giving thousands more parents a choice of high-quality local schools that offer the excellent standard of education that all pupils deserve. I am pleased to see how free schools are collaborating and supporting other nearby schools - and now 35 more of them will help even more young people fulfil their potential. Free schools are brand new state-funded schools. They are independent of local council control and have the freedom to innovate and respond directly to the needs of parents and the local community. Several of the schools - for example Pinner High in Harrow and SASH 2 in Slough - have been set up by a group of local headteachers who are taking advantage of the free school policy to spread their expertise and track record of success. Free schools are predominantly located in areas with shortages of places. All mainstream schools approved today are in areas with a need for high quality places. And more than a third of schools approved today will be in the 30% most deprived communities in England. There are currently 251 open free schools, and now a further 112 are in the pipeline. Once all of these schools are fully up and running they will provide around 200,000 extra school places to pupils across the country. Commenting in today’s survey, Christine Inchley, headteacher of Stour Valley Community School in Suffolk, said: All pupils are benefiting from free schools - not just those who attend them. One head of a local school has openly stated that the opening of our school made him work hard to raise standards at his own school. The survey shows the majority of free schools surveyed - 57% - run an extended school day, while a further 15% plan to do so. The government has made it easier for all schools, not just free schools, to extend the length of the school day, which can help more pupils fulfil their potential. Pupils at Sir Thomas Fremantle Secondary School, a free school in Winslow, Buckinghamshire, remain in school until 4:30pm each day. Today’s survey also shows that around half of free school headteachers said they are using admissions procedures that are different to neighbouring schools. One fifth of these said they are giving priority for school places to disadvantaged pupils - helping pupils from all backgrounds fulfil their potential. Cramlington Village Primary School, a free school in Northumberland, prioritises disadvantaged pupils through its admissions process. The school has an above average number of these pupils, who Ofsted recognise are achieving well. Four in 10 of headteachers responding said their term dates differ to their surrounding schools. Free schools such as the Boulevard Academy, a free school in Hull, Yorkshire, are using their freedoms to alter their term dates to help their pupils succeed. Boulevard has reduced the 6 week summer holiday and introduced Saturday learning to increase the amount of time pupils are taught. The survey also finds that 82% of secondary free schools offer an enrichment programme - additional activities designed to boost the character and wider development of students. Sir Thomas Fremantle offers an extensive programme including use of 3D printing technology and a combined cadet force. Among the schools announced today, of which around half are set to open in September 2015, are: Harington School in Rutland, East Midlands , the first sixth-form college in the county. The 300-place school will be led in partnership by the Catmose Federation of academies and Oakham School, a nearby independent school. It will offer a traditional academic education to help students gain entry to Russell Group universities in an area where many students have to leave the county for post-16 education. Ongar Academy in Ongar, Essex , the first secondary school in the town for more than a quarter of a century. It will offer a broad curriculum focusing on science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) to 800 students, including 200 sixth formers Harrow Bilingual Primary School in Harrow, London , which will use the freedoms enjoyed by free schools to offer a bilingual English-French curriculum to up to 420 pupils. Wynyard Church of England Primary School in Wynyard, Stockton-On-Tees , which will provide 420 places to cater for the expansion of house-building in the local area. Pinner High School in Harrow, London, a new school set up by teachers from 8 successful local schools. Up to 1,152 pupils will benefit from their combined expertise and experience. Since 2010, the Department for Education has received more than 1,300 applications for new schools across the country. An estimated 40,000 pupils are already attending a free school just 3 years after the first school opened its doors. Notes to editors View the ‘Are free schools using innovative approaches?’ research report. Not all of the free schools listed as examples above participated in the survey. Of the 35 free school applications approved today: 27 are mainstream schools 11 are primary schools 9 are secondary schools 5 are all-through schools 2 are 16 to 19 schools 4 are for alternative provision 4 are special schools The majority (72%) of the mainstream schools approved today are in areas where our school capacity data survey for the academic year 2012 to 2013 shows there is a need of more school places (or ‘basic need’). A further 7 have been assessed as being in areas where there is a shortage of high quality places or where local authorities have advised the department more recently that they will need additional school places, meaning that all schools approved today are in an area of some need. The free schools groups approved today will now finalise their plans in readiness to open from September 2015. Chief among their tasks will be to secure a site. The department has co-developed the ‘Government Property Finder’ online service with the Cabinet Office. This service lists all surplus government property available to buy or rent, including those suitable for free schools. Preparations also include undertaking a statutory consultation in their local area and taking steps to recruit their school’s principal designate. Due to the popularity of free schools, the Department for Education has changed the application process to allow parents and other groups up to 3 opportunities per year to submit proposals, compared to just 1 previously. Not only does this provide flexibility to proposers to submit their application at the time that suits them best, it also means the government can consider applications throughout the year. Free school proposals approved in the east of England Bedford Technical Academy, Bedford, east of England secondary (ages 13 to 18), 624 places In response to overwhelming demand from parents and young people, Bedford College is to open a new school in 2016 that will offer high quality academic and technical subjects such as specialist training in science, service and creative technologies in addition to high quality GCSEs . Post-16, young people will be able to work towards the new Technical Baccalaureate - a rigorous, challenging qualification that will ensure they have the technical ability that employers want. Local businesses, including Whitbread, Bourns Ltd and Colworth Science Park, have pledged their support to the school and will provide materials and equipment, as well as providing young people with an insight into exciting potential career paths.

/government/news/new-wave-of-approved-studio-schools-will-take-total-to-more-than-40--2,"The Government today announced that 13 new Studio Schools are set to open from September 2014 - backed by more than 100 major national and local employers. Studio Schools allow 14- to 19-year-olds to study academic subjects through practical projects designed and delivered by employers. Pupils combine core GCSEs and vocational qualifications with real work experience at places like the UK Space Agency - for those aged 16 or over this is up to two days and usually paid. Most Studio Schools operate longer days and terms, mirroring the workplace. The Studio School projects have all been approved to move to pre-opening stage and will be situated across England. Pupils in Studio Schools will study core GCSEs alongside vocational qualifications. This should enable them to leave with the knowledge, skills and attitude to work that employers demand. The projects approved today will specialise in a range of subjects including business, retail, ICT, marine manufacturing, engineering and digital technologies and will cater for around 4,000 young people. These 13 Studio Schools join 15 that are already preparing to open and 16 currently open. Together they will create opportunities for almost 14,000 young people, preparing them for the world of work by developing transferrable employability skills - punctuality, good communication, reliability and team working - whilst enabling students to gain a strong grounding in English, maths and science. Schools Minister Lord Nash said: I am delighted to be approving such a strong field of Studio Schools to the next stage. More employers are getting involved in Studio Schools, demonstrating their commitment to preparing young people - who will be their future employees - for the world of work. It is crucial for young people to have the skills and experience vital to employers, both for their own prosperity and to help us compete in the global race. Schools Commissioner Dr Elizabeth Sidwell said: I am delighted that we have been able to approve more Studio Schools to open. These schools will put young people in communities across the country in touch with their local employers and will give them valuable experience of the workplace, while still studying for their core academic qualifications. They are crucial in helping those young people who prefer practical learning to pick up the skills wanted by employers, and it is great to see so many organisations working together to improve the life chances of young people. Chair of the Studio Schools Trust Geoff Mulgan said: Today’s announcement is very good news for both young people and employers. Studio Schools are spreading - and will soon be a network of over 40 - because they’ve shown their worth in providing young people with the skills and attitudes they need to make a success of work and life. Young people learn better when they’re tackling real life problems, and they learn better when there’s a clear line of sight linking what they do in school to future jobs and careers. All of the existing studio schools should be very heartened by this vote of confidence. But in many ways this is just the beginning. Studio Schools are becoming a movement whose goal couldn’t be more important: to make the most of otherwise wasted potential, and connect learning to the very best of science and enterprise in all its forms. The latest round of approved projects will enjoy input from more than 100 local and national employers, giving them direct involvement in shaping the future workforce. Employers say they are struggling to find the skills they are looking for in school leavers. Last year’s CBI annual education and skills survey showed that almost two-thirds - 61 per cent - of employers were unsatisfied with the self-management skills of school leavers. Employers were also not satisfied with their literacy and numeracy skills - 35 per cent and 30 per cent respectively. Anu Ojha, Director of the National Space Academy Programme at the National Space Centre, said: The UK’s space industry is one of this country’s best-kept secrets - amongst the fastest growing sectors of the UK economy (nearly 10 per cent per year) with 29,000 employees, a turnover to the country of more than £9 billion per year and world-leading expertise in space robotics, satellite communications and a host of other space technologies. One of the biggest challenges for the sector is sustaining this growth - to achieve its potential the UK space industry will need new entrants at both degree level and higher apprenticeship technical level. The Banbury Space Studio School, with its proximity to Harwell (the UK’s science campus for space science and particle physics with thousands of engineers, technicians and scientists on site) and support from the UK space sector, will be well placed to make a tangible contribution not only to the growth prospects for the sector but also to the aspirations of the young people studying at the Studio School who wish to become part of this successful and inspiring industry.

Notes to editors: The successful Studio Schools have been through a rigorous process including assessment and interview by the Department and the Education Funding Agency (EFA). Studio Schools are an innovative way for employers to get involved in helping to give young people the skills businesses need. They equip young people, who prefer practical learning, with the qualifications and skills to help companies prosper. Study is combined with work placements with local and national employers who are involved in the school. They teach a rigorous academic and vocational curriculum to typically 300 students aged 14 to 19. All Studio Schools offer GCSEs in English, maths and science and other GCSEs and vocational qualifications which are recognised by employers and universities. Studio Schools differ from other schools in the way they deliver these qualifications: All subjects are taught through projects designed with employers. They typically operate longer days and outside standard school terms - giving pupils a good understanding of a working day, and the importance of good attendance and punctuality in business. Alongside their studies, pupils carry out work placements for four hours a week with employers who partner with the school. After age 16, this increases to two days a week and pupils are usually paid for this work. Each pupil has a ‘personal coach’ who replicates the role of a supportive line manager in the workplace. Coaches also help students get the most out of the curriculum and their work placements. In addition to the 13 approved today, 16 Studio Schools are already open and a further 15 are working to open either this September or September 2014 (see below table). The Department has recently published arrangements for inviting the next wave of applications on its website.

/government/news/nctl-launch-school-direct-for-early-years-initial-teacher-training,"The tender process for 2015 recruitment is now closed. Successful completion of early years initial teacher training will lead to the award of early years teacher status. Early years teacher status is the equivalent to qualified teacher status as the entry requirements to early years teacher training are the same as for primary teacher training. Early years teachers specialise in early childhood development and are trained to teach across the early years foundation stage (from birth to 5 years old). They must also understand how early education links to education beyond age 5 and into key stages 1 and 2 in school. School Direct (Early Years) creates more employer-led training, giving employers (schools and nurseries) the opportunity to recruit and select their own early years teacher trainees and engage in the design and delivery of early years ITT in partnership with accredited training providers. The programme enables schools and nurseries to: influence how early years teachers are trained recruit the trainees that best meet their and their partnership’s needs, with the expectation that trainees will go on to work with the group of schools and nurseries where they trained decide which accredited training provider to work with and influence the way in which the training is delivered This method of training is fully funded by National College for Teaching and Leadership and course fees of £7,000 are paid for all trainees. Bursaries are also available: £9,000 for graduates with a first class degree and £4,000 for graduates with a 2:1."

We have secured funding for free childcare for three- and four-year-olds as well as the most disadvantaged two-year-olds. As councils make their spending decisions in the coming months, I hope they recognise the priority the Government has placed on early education. We know high-quality Early Years support can have a lasting impact on children’s lives, so we will expect local authorities to channel resources at those who will benefit most from the excellent support children’s centres can offer.

/government/speeches/nick-gibb-to-the-specialist-schools-and-academies-trust,"Thank you. It was a pleasure to speak at the SSAT Conference in November to set out the principles at the heart of our white paper, ‘The Importance of Teaching’- that the education system must trust the professionalism of heads and teachers. Today I’ve been asked to talk about the Curriculum Review which we launched in January. There is always a danger that headteachers and teachers might be suffering from ‘curriculum review fatigue’ after the last two decades. There was a view - expressed particularly by the QCA and QCDA as it became - that the curriculum should be in a perpetual state of revolution and change. That’s not our view. We need a review to sort out the curriculum, to reduce its volume and prescription about how to teach. But then we need a period of stability. I’ve been greatly heartened by the huge response to the review - from not just the education sector but the academic world; business; and the wider public. There have been almost 5800 responses to the call for evidence - the highest response to any education consultation. Included in that is the submission from SSAT itself. We’ve had an extensive programme of events up and down the country to listen carefully to the views of teachers; subject experts; learned societies; Higher and Further education. And we’ll carry on consulting widely throughout the review process. As I’m sure you’ll appreciate - it is early days and today I’m not going to get into the territory of pre-empting the outcome of such an exhaustive, expert-led, evidence-based review. But the spirit of open and honest thinking; passionate but constructive argument; and hard-headed, detailed analysis of international and national research is exactly what we wanted to harness. This same spirit was at the heart of the-then Prime Minister Jim Callaghan’s Ruskin College speech 35 years ago, where he called for a “rational debate based on facts” - what became known as The Great Debate - about the nature and purpose of state education policy. Callaghan argued it was vital for the country’s future prosperity to ask radical and at the time politically toxic, questions such as whether or not to have a national curriculum; a national inspectorate; a national exams system; and national performance standards. His point was two-fold. First: that the education world did not have, what he called, “exclusive rights” on talking about what happened in schools. He deferred to teachers’ professionalism and expertise in the classroom. But for him, the furious rows in the late-60s between the Plowden “progressives” and Black Paper “traditionalists” were far too insular. In a democracy, the whole of society has a stake and say in education. For him, reducing debate around schools and universities to political mantras merely alienated the public. And his second point was that we constantly need to balance how education best equips young people not just for work but for life. As he put it: “There is no virtue in producing socially well-adjusted members of society who are unemployed because they do not have the skills. Nor at the other extreme must they be technically efficient robots. Both of the basic purposes of education require the same essential tools… basic literacy, basic numeracy, the understanding of how to live and work together, respect for others and respect for the individual”. I’m not going to rake over the arguments of the 1970s, ’80s and ’90s in setting up and establishing the National Curriculum, external testing and Ofsted. But Callaghan’s words are worth bearing in mind as we today face our own twenty-first century Great Debate in education - how to create a truly world class curriculum, which keeps pace with the leading systems and meets the demands of business, universities and society to compete globally. Our White Paper made clear there is much to admire and build on in England: Hundreds of outstanding schools. Tens of thousands of great teachers. Academies established and outstripping the rest of the secondary sector. And a culture of innovative specialisms entrenched and embedded throughout the sector. But it was also clear that too many children are still being let down. It’s no longer good enough to judge ourselves simply by how much we spend on education or against rigid, domestic targets. The attainment gap between rich and poor remains stubbornly and unacceptably wide at all levels of education. Of those children who do not qualify for Free School Meals 77% achieved the required level in English at the end of primary school compared to 56% of those who do qualify for Free School Meals. Similarly at GCSE, 56% of non-Free School Meal pupils achieved 5 or more good GCSEs last year compared to 31% of pupils who do qualify - and that 25 point gap has remained stubbornly constant over recent years. We’re falling back in the PISA international rankings, from fourth to sixteenth in science; seventh to 25th in literacy; and eighth to 28th in maths - meaning our 15-year-olds are two years behind their Chinese peers in maths; and a year behind teenagers in Korea or Finland in reading. And we’ve got to listen to the concerns of the private sector - the annual CBI education and skills survey just last week found that almost half of employers had to invest in remedial training for school and college leavers. In the modern world, there is nowhere to hide for school leavers. Jobs can be transported across international borders in a blink of an eye. The pace of technological change means that new industries are evolving in the space of years not decades. And so having a National Curriculum that’s thin on content and overly prescriptive on teaching method is not doing our children any favours in such a tough environment. The clues for success are there in the consistent, growing picture about how the best performing education systems operate - an international evidence base which simply didn’t exist a few years ago. PISA, OECD, McKinsey and others tell us that despite most developed countries in the world doubling or even tripling their education spending since the mid-1970s, outcomes have varied wildly. Because it is not how much you invest in education that counts. It is how you invest it. The strongest systems recruit and develop the best teachers. They have strong leadership. They have internationally benchmarked assessments and qualifications. They take the right balance between giving schools greater autonomy and rigorously holding them to account. And crucially they develop coherent national curricula that allow for the steady accumulation of knowledge and conceptual understanding. Our National Curriculum was originally envisaged as a guide to study in key subjects; giving parents and teachers confidence that students were acquiring the knowledge necessary at every level of study. But the glaring weaknesses are clear for all to see - as last November’s invaluable report by Cambridge Assessment’s Tim Oates, called Could Do Better, sets out. Tim argues powerfully that we’ve been looking inwards and backwards when debating our curriculum, instead of outwards and forwards at what the rest of the world do. And he sets out how previous reforms over the last 20 years have failed to eradicate the systemic and inherent problems which have built up: • acute overload, with far too much pressure to move through material with undue pace - which inadvertently has created a tick list mentality; • too many new core topics and subjects being added - which have diluted and undermined the curriculum’s purpose and stability; • too weak and inconsistent a link with testing and assessment; • and a constant blurring of the lines between prescribing teaching method with essential knowledge. As he puts it: “The England National Curriculum is, in law, an expression of content and of aims and values. It cannot do everything. To expect it so to do will most likely result in failure.” And he’s right. The National Curriculum is too important to draw it up simply by arbitrating between which lobby group shouts loudest - rather than on sound, evidence-based reasoning. It must never be a prescriptive straitjacket - constraining teachers by dictating teaching methods. It must never attempt to cover every conceivable area of human knowledge or endeavour. It must never become a vehicle for imposing political or academic fads on our children. It must never emphasise generic learning skills over vital knowledge, concepts and facts on which all children’s education is built. The current system fails because it confuses the core National Curriculum and the wider school curriculum. The real curriculum - taught and untaught - is the total experience of a child within the school. It includes not just class teaching but all the unseen, incremental social and personal development that goes into preparing a student for the wider world. The National Curriculum can never - and should never - specify and control every element of it. And as Tim Oates says it will always run into terrible difficulty if it does. So the new National Curriculum will get this balance right. It will embody rigour and high standards and create coherence in what is taught in schools. It will give every child the chance to gain a set core of essential knowledge and concepts. It will set act as a benchmark for the entire state sector. It will provide parents with a clear understanding of what progress they should expect. It will be internationally respected by being judged against the leading curricula in the world. But above all, it will give teachers the freedom to use their experience and skills to design their own programmes - to innovate beyond the academic core it sets out and let them get on with the job of motivating, enthusing and engaging young people. We’ve got to get away from a mentality that just because an activity, topic or subject is important, it has to be specified in the National Curriculum. And just because something isn’t in the National Curriculum doesn’t mean it’s not taught. It’s time for teachers to regain confidence in their own professionalism and judgement about how best to teach. And to demonstrate once and for all that politicians and civil servants trust them to do so. That’s why our view is not just being advised by Tim Oates and his expert panel but by an advisory committee made up of some of the most outstanding head teachers in the country. So let me end by reassuring you that this is not just another curriculum review. We’re deliberately taking our time to get this right by carrying out the review in two distinct phases over three years. We want this to be a one-off change that will deliver a stable National Curriculum because it focuses on core knowledge and core concepts - instead of needing to be constantly updated with all the knock-on effects on pedagogy, administration, teaching materials and training. We’ve learnt the lessons of a continual cycle of reforms which simply entrenched existing weaknesses because they were made in isolation to the wider system. And it is why the curriculum is so closely tied into the wider white paper programme, much of which I know you are discussing later on today: • strengthening and reforming vocational education through Professor Alison Wolf’s proposals • reviewing Key Stage 2 testing, assessment and accountability to cut down teaching to the test and give parents clear information on their children’s progress; • benchmarking qualifications against the leading systems in the world; • targeting early years education on preparing pupils for their first years at primary school; • setting out the biggest programme of reform in SEN and disabilities education for 30 years; • reforming Ofsted - so it focuses on leadership, teaching, attainment and behaviour and cuts out unnecessary bureaucracy; • strengthening training and recruitment to attract the brightest and best into the profession - as well as giving existing teachers top-class career development; • and seeking to take out perverse incentives from the performance tables that can incentivise some schools to offer qualifications that are more in the interests of the school’s league table position than in the best interests of the student. The whole thrust of these changes is to make sure that the no element of the curriculum is off-limits to any child - particularly those subjects and qualifications that progress to A level, further or higher education. That’s why we’ve introduced the concept of the English Baccalaureate - which I’m sure we will discuss in a moment. I know that far more than just one in 25 students on free school meals - and one in six overall - are capable of achieving at least a C in GCSE English, maths, two sciences, a language and a humanity. So the entire system needs to be built around giving more students the opportunity to study the most rigorous core academic subjects, while leaving enough space for wider study. We should be asking ourselves how in as many as 175 state secondary schools not a single pupil could even have taken the EBacc last year because they weren’t entered for all the subjects - the same subjects the Russell Group identifies as key for university study. And it’s right to question and discuss how in 719 maintained mainstream schools, no pupil entered any of the single award science GCSEs; no pupil was entered for French in 169 schools; no pupil was entered for geography in 137; and no pupil was entered for history in 70. So events like today’s are crucial. We have never denied this is an ambitious programme. But nor do want to shy away from the challenges ahead. Developing a new National Curriculum is a deliberately detailed and in-depth process. Sustaining momentum is vital. And I thank you for your engagement so that together we can make it a success."

Ask for an ‘internal review’ You can ask Ofsted to review your complaint again (known as an internal review) if you’re not happy with the way it was handled. You must do this within 15 working days of the date the original response was sent. A ‘scrutiny committee’ will independently review the handling of your complaint. You should get a final response within 30 working days. If you’re still unhappy You can ask Independent Complaints Adjudication Service for Ofsted ( ICASO ) to review the case. You must do this within 3 months of getting Ofsted’s written response to the internal review. ICASO can’t change the outcome of the complaint, but it can make recommendations to Ofsted. If you’re an individual or a private organisation and you’re unhappy with ICASO ’s review, you can also complain to the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman .

/government/news/views-sought-on-which-2-year-olds-should-get-free-early-education,"Up to 300,000 babies born this year are set to benefit from 15 hours of free early education each week when they are two years old, as the government announces plans to roll out free early education to more children across England. Today Sarah Teather, Minister for Children and Families, launched a consultation calling for views on which two year olds should benefit. This is the second phase of the roll-out of free early education to around 40% of 2-year-old children to help prepare them for school and give them the best possible start in life. In the consultation launched today the government said that 2 year olds from families who meet the criteria for free school meals will continue to be eligible. In addition, the Department for Education proposes that 2-year-old children should get free early education if they: are in low income families earning no more than £16,190 each year have special educational needs or a disability have been in care and been adopted Nick Clegg, Deputy Prime Minister, said: A decent early education can make a huge difference to the start of a child’s progress, unlocking their potential to help them follow their ambitions. All children should have a fair chance to get on in life, which is why we’re extending free childcare to 40% of two-year-olds. Today’s consultation is about making sure we get that right. Sarah Teather, Minister for Children and Families, said: There is compelling evidence that early education, through play and stories, helps young children prepare for school in their crucial early years. We have an ambitious programme to roll out free early education and it is vital that this support, backed by funding rising to £760 million by 2014 to 2015, is targeted towards those who need it. Babies born this year will receive the benefit of high-quality early education in 2 years’ time. It’s vital that we get this right for their sake. This government is doing all it can to ensure that children in the poorest families are able to achieve what they want to do. The consultation is launched on the day the minister gave a speech at the Association of Directors of Children’s Services conference in Manchester where she said: Our recent launch of the childcare commission and the millions we’re investing in early years are a mark of the government’s determination to give every child the best start in life, even against a tough economic backdrop. This is the right thing to do. It helps create a fairer society and boosts social mobility. The benefits are tangible, real and valued by parents. From September 2013, under the first phase of the entitlement, the least advantaged 20% of 2-year-olds will receive free early education. The government is trialling the delivery of this first phase in 10 areas in England later this year. The new entitlement for 2-year-olds builds on the universal free entitlement for 3- and 4-year-old children across England. Notes to editors Extending free early years education to more 2-year-olds. The government is currently examining childcare costs in a commission that was announced by the Prime Minister on Tuesday 19 June. This is looking at the effectiveness of current support, wraparound care, best practice from home and abroad, and the impact of bureaucracy. It is also considering the findings of Professor Cathy Nutbrown’s report, Foundations for Quality - the independent review of early education and childcare qualifications, which looks to enhance quality in the sector. The government will report back on both issues later this year. Children are entitled to free school meals if their parents receive any of the following benefits: income support; job seekers’ allowance; employment and support allowance; or child tax credit with an income of less than £16,190 providing they are not receiving working tax credit.

/government/speeches/nick-gibb-speech-on-governments-maths-reforms,"Good morning. It’s a pleasure to be here today at the Harris Primary maths conference. This government’s education reforms have been the most radical for a generation. And the growth of the Harris Federation of academies and free schools to a chain of 36 primary and secondary schools has been one of the great successes of the last 5 years. Our approach to deliver greater autonomy for schools through academisation was based on clear evidence from around the world that in the most successful school systems schools are autonomous and accountable. The Harris Federation is also part of another of the evidence-based approaches we have put at the heart of our education reforms - mathematics for mastery. In early years teaching, Harris schools use Singapore maths and beyond the early years, Harris primary schools have adopted the effective mathematics curriculum, which combines Singapore and Shanghai approaches, and use maths no problem textbooks. As part of the second wave of the Shanghai teacher exchange, last week I was fortunate enough to observe a lesson at the Harris Primary Academy in Chafford Hundred, Essex, led by Lin Lei. In a 35 minute lesson, with all pupils facing the teacher and engaged throughout, Lin taught all of the pupils to carry out complex types of long multiplication through clear explanation of calculation methods. Some of you may have already heard me tell that story (perhaps even more than once) since I observed the lesson last week! But I think that reflects something truly positive - that we are undergoing a transformation in our approach to maths and how it is taught in schools. That transformation is so important, because our performance in maths had been stagnating over a number of years. From 2005 to 2010, while in opposition I visited hundreds of schools across the country. What I learnt from these visits was that few pupils at primary or secondary school knew their times tables. Long multiplication and long division were rarely taught, with inefficient methods such as the grid method for multiplication and chunking for long division commonplace in classrooms, neither of which are used in the Far East. When I showed visiting members of the Shanghai Municipal Education Commission they were bemused. I have also spent time reviewing grade E and F scripts of all 3 main exam boards maths GCSEs . What this exercise revealed was that most of the problems came down to a lack of knowledge of how to carry out basic arithmetic: pupils couldn’t multiply numbers of more than 1 digit. This was a result of the approach to teaching maths. For too long we set expectations too low for pupils. An approach of differentiation in primary schools saw classes being taught in different groups, pupils expected to progress at different rates and acceleration on to new topics for those doing well rather than consolidation. An over-emphasis on concepts at the expense of practice, fluency and, through that, understanding meant that too many pupils simply did not know how to perform calculations. Using textbooks became unpopular, with only 10% of maths teachers in England using a textbook for core teaching, compared to 70% in Singapore and 95% in Finland according to TIMSS 2011. This stagnation was reflected in our international performance in maths. Coming 24th in the PISA maths tables in 2012 was equivalent to a 3 year difference between the performance of our 15-year-olds and those at the top of the table - in Shanghai. And take up of the study of maths post-15 in England was among the lowest throughout the OECD . Education was failing pupils - too often those from poorer backgrounds - and denying them the opportunities that come with the study of maths. Only a solid grounding in the basics of maths will allow pupils to do well at the next level and proceed to further study such as A level. People with an A level in maths go on to earn 7 to 10% more than similarly educated people without the qualification and it opens doors to a whole range of interesting careers. We want to inspire young people to recognise the importance of maths and the opportunities it can offer, and continue studying it to the highest level so that they can compete with the best in the world and succeed throughout their education and careers. That is why we have attached such importance to maths, along with STEM subjects more widely. We have introduced the 34 new maths hubs and £67 million announced by the Prime Minister for STEM teaching will improve the skills of 15,000 existing teachers, and recruit an additional 2,500 specialist maths and physics teachers over the next Parliament. We have come a long way already. Here we are today talking about mastery - which embodies the idea that every pupil can do well and achieve high standards in maths. Mastery is the model of the high-performing Asian systems such as Shanghai, Singapore and South Korea. It delivers a meticulous approach to arithmetic, whole class teaching and focused 35 minute lessons. Frequent practice allows pupils to consolidate their understanding, and pupils are assisted through immediate and tailored in-class questioning and scaffolding techniques. Homework is frequent, and simply and quickly marked. The mastery approach also uses high quality resources and teaching tools - especially textbooks. Great effort and collaboration goes towards perfecting lesson design, with close attention to effective teaching methods. Whole lessons are devoted to thorough teaching of small steps of calculation - the use of the zero, for example in long multiplication. We have introduced a new national curriculum, which is more detailed and more demanding, to reflect the mastery approach. Year 1 pupils are introduced to all 4 functions and to basic fractions. In year 2, basic columnar addition and subtraction is studied, with carrying and borrowing in year 3. In year 2 the teaching of times tables begins, and pupils are expected to know all of the times tables up to 12 x 12 by year 4. Instant recall of facts like times tables is crucial because the working memory is small and so they need to be committed to long term memory, as explained by Daniel Willingham in his book ‘Why don’t students like school’. Such recall from long term memory is essential to be able to add fractions, and perform long multiplication and division, which pupils will be taught in year 5 and year 6. The year by year approach sets out greater clarity and the focus on fluency in the essentials of maths allows time for pupils to practise more to ensure deep knowledge. We are also expecting the majority of pupils to move through programmes of study at roughly the same pace. We have made important changes to testing. The new key stage 2 tests will assess pupils’ mastery of mathematics and the first of these new tests will be taken in summer 2016. At secondary level, reformed maths GCSEs will be more challenging qualifications, sat for the first time in 2017, with teaching beginning in September this year. While A levels will only introduce a small amount of new content, students will be required to have a deeper understanding of the mathematics they are taught. We have also focused on progression to A level, which has increased by 13% since 2010, meaning maths is now the most popular A level. There is no doubt that we could not be delivering these reforms to maths without the work and dedication of schools and school groups like Harris and others who are also here today. Through the maths hubs programme, you have been taking part in the Shanghai teacher exchange, which provides an important opportunity to learn from teachers in one of the best systems in the world, as you implement teaching for mastery in your schools. The most recent exchange came to an end on Friday, and was a resounding success. Across the maths hubs, schools are also trialling Singapore textbooks, which provide a coherent, structured programme and benefit teachers, pupils and parents. The next step to help spread and embed mastery is to develop a cadre of 140 primary mastery experts, who will support 3,500 teachers across primary schools to introduce teaching for mastery of mathematics effectively. I am grateful to all of you for being part of these reforms. They are an important example of how we have looked to the evidence of what works to deliver better outcomes to inform our policymaking. I am confident that the reward we reap from this approach will be a better quality maths teaching in our schools, higher standards of attainment among pupils and greater opportunities for them as a result. Thank you."

/government/news/elizabeth-truss-is-interviewed-by-nursery-world-magazine,"On her impressions of the sector I obviously met quite a lot of people before I got the job, and it’s an area I’m interested in. I’ve got young children myself. I think that quality has improved. We’ve seen a growing professionalism in the childcare sector as a whole. A lot of the discussions that I’ve had with providers have been that there is an issue with sustainability. Feedback that I get from parliamentary colleagues is that some providers are struggling. We know there is also an issue with the extent to which parents can afford childcare. My broad feeling is that it is an industry that has changed, but there are a lot of issues. One of the things I’ve been doing is visiting other countries … we’re all facing similar issues. There’s a growing recognition of the real importance of early years both from the point of view of child development and from women’s/parents’ participation in the labour market. We know we’re in a more competitive world where the quality of our education is really important to our future prospects as a country and I think that early years is rightly being recognised as a really important part of that. What I want to do is learn from the successes and failures of others and also look at what’s best in our system. There are some very strong aspects to our system - for example, the Ofsted inspection regime. I think there’s a lot to work with. I think there’s a great deal of interest in new ideas and innovations. It’s a very interesting time to be doing the job. On the tensions between the needs of the child and the need to get parents into work The reality is that parents want what is best for their children. People don’t want to go out to work not being happy that their child is being well looked after and being prepared for the future, and they want to know that the child has the best possible quality care. I think that (the two things) are completely compatible and I think they have to be because we don’t want parents to go out to work at the expense of their child’s development and education at all. What I want to do is make sure that our system focuses on the really important things, which are the safety of the child and the quality of care that the child is receiving so that our regulatory system and our professional qualifications are focused on those two things rather than other things which don’t contribute. I want to make things simpler and focus on what is important to parents and what is important to our country as a whole. It’s really important that children receive the best possible early education. On working mothers The Resolution Foundation has rightly in my view raised the issue of middle income families and second earners who face a particular squeeze in this country, and I am concerned that we have fewer mothers going out to work now than they do in France and Germany, and, if you look at the 1980s and 1990s, we had more mothers as a proportion. That’s not to say that I want to force mothers back to work. The Department for Education has done a survey that shows that roughly 50% of mothers have chosen to stay at home and 50% would like to go out to work but the circumstances make it difficult, and one of the main issues is the cost of childcare and the availability. On funding streams There’s a confusing number of funding streams. The funding isn’t transparent. [That doesn’t] contribute to those two objectives of quality and safety. At the moment in our system not enough of the £6bn spent by the government is reaching the frontline. We want as much of that money as possible to be going on high-quality provision. We want providers to have an incentive to make sure that their provision is as high quality as possible. We’re leaking out funding. Quality costs, but we’re also spending money on things that don’t contribute to quality and that is simply a question of getting better value for the money we spend. We’ve got a problem in that some providers are struggling to stay afloat and at the same time we’re pumping quite a lot of money into the system. So the question for me is, how do we make that work better? On the free entitlement for 2-, 3- and 4-year-olds I think simplicity and transparency are really important - to say to providers you are going to be rewarded for hiring high-quality staff, for putting on good staff training and development, for making sure that you are following best possible child development practice. We are going to be judging, or the system is going to be judging, the quality of outcomes and the quality of engagement with the child. On the forthcoming response to the Nutbrown review of early years and childcare education We need to make sure that it’s not just the people in the nursery and childcare system who understand what’s happening, but also that parents understand what qualifications mean. It’s back to this point about simplicity and transparency. I want the early years profession to be a really attractive occupation for people leaving school and for graduates. I want it to be something that people want to go into. I think it’s really important that the profession is as outward-facing as possible, and that people understand what the qualifications are and what they mean. There [need to be] new expectations around salary levels. There is an issue with pay in particular parts of the sector. I think all these things are linked, so I want to give quite a comprehensive response about the regulatory system, and about what we’re going to do about qualifications as well. I want to build on the Early Years Professional Status (EYPS). It’s been a positive move and I want to build on it. We’ll also be looking at Ofsted and the way Ofsted measures outcomes. That will all be addressed under our response to the Nutbrown Review. The other aspect is increasing the level of professional discretion and professionalisation, and that means allowing, where there are not issues of quality and safety, providers more say in how they operate. I think it’s really important that if we say to people you are a graduate leader, that we allow people to exercise that professional judgement, and that’s what parents want - high quality, trusted people who are properly regulated by Ofsted, making decisions about how they run their nursery, their childminding practice. On lessons from abroad If you look at countries such as France and Germany, they are managing to get very high quality. If you speak to French parents about the quality of their 0-3s care, it’s very well regarded. They are managing to get high quality and high affordability and the government funding is more evenly spread across providers. So they are managing to use that government funding better, they allow more discretion, they’ve got very strong quality measures. So my question is, how do we get to that kind of system? I don’t think we should be defensive. Yes, a lot has been achieved, but in order to get to a new level, and we need to get to a new level both for the sake of children and their development and for the sake of parents who are struggling, we need to be flexible.

/government/news/good-early-years-get-children-off-to-a-flying-start-says-ofsted,"Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector, Sir Michael Wilshaw, formally launched a consultation on changes to the inspection framework aimed at improving the quality of early years provision during a visit to the Thomas Coram Early Childhood Centre, in central London. Inspection evidence shows nurseries, pre-schools and childminders are not improving fast enough. At the end of August 2012, up to 243,400 children were being cared for in early years providers that were not yet good. This represents almost 22% of the places available in the sector. Ofsted’s last Annual Report showed that 40% of early years providers had been judged satisfactory for two consecutive inspections – and 11% had gone down a grade. Poor quality early years care and education is a particular problem in the poorest areas, where Ofsted has found that providers are less likely to improve between inspections than those in more prosperous areas. Under the proposed changes that will come into force from this September, only a good or better standard of early years provision will be deemed good enough by Ofsted. The proposals will raise expectations and tackle weaker settings.Ofsted’s consultation proposes: a judgement of ‘requires improvement’ to replace the current ‘satisfactory’ judgement for all early years providers, to bring them in line with the standards already expected of schools and colleges for nurseries and pre-schools ‘requiring improvement’, increasing the frequency of inspections and imposing a maximum of four years to get to ‘good’. If a nursery or pre-school fail to become ‘good’ after two consecutive inspections, it is likely they will be judged ‘inadequate’ where an inadequate early years setting fails to improve sufficiently and is still judged to be ‘inadequate’ after re-inspection, it is likely steps may be taken to cancel that setting’s registration Ofsted will also strengthen registration and ensure rigorous enforcement for those who are not improving fast enough, and those failing to comply with requirements set out in the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS). Sir Michael said: We all know from the research that children’s early years are a period of rapid development and vital for building a secure foundation for future personal and academic success. Parents, whatever their circumstances, want their children to access good quality childcare and get a good early education that sets them up well for statutory schooling. Yet too many providers are not good enough, particularly in the most deprived areas. We must be tougher on weak settings. From September 2013, nurseries and pre-schools judged less than good will need to improve rapidly. I want the new designation of ‘requires improvement’ to act as a catalyst to get all early years providers to good as soon as possible. We’ll encourage providers that are good or outstanding to support weaker settings. We know that the best schools are joining forces and we anticipate that this will happen in the early years. Sir Michael said that Ofsted will also be sharper about reporting on the levels of qualifications held by early years staff. He said: We know that staff expertise and qualifications make a distinct difference to the richness of young children’s experiences and that there is a clear correlation between the quality of provision and the level of staff qualifications. The consultation closes on 24 May 2013. The revised framework is set to take effect from September 2013. Bernadette Duffy, Head of Thomas Coram Centre said: We support Ofsted’s view that all young children should have the best education in their early years and the opportunity to thrive in whatever school or setting they attend. At the moment too many young children attend settings that are not yet good or better and we need to be doing all we can through the inspection process to help practitioners in these settings. These are crucial years in children’s lives and it is vital that they are in settings that promote their well-being now and give them the best foundation for the future. Notes to editors The ‘Good early years provision for all’ consultation opened on 19 April 2013 and closes on 24 May 2013. The government is considering proposals for childminder agencies. Ofsted is not making proposals about the early re-inspection of childminders at this time. Ofsted will consult on inspections of childminders, including those who join a childminder agency. Ofsted also inspects children’s centres. The framework for the inspection of Sure Start children’s centres implemented in April 2013 can be found on the Ofsted website. The Office for Standards in Education, Children’s Services and Skills (Ofsted) regulates and inspects to achieve excellence in the care of children and young people, and in education and skills for learners of all ages. It regulates and inspects childcare and children’s social care, and inspects the Children and Family Court Advisory Support Service (Cafcass), schools, colleges, initial teacher training, work-based learning and skills training, adult and community learning, and education and training in prisons and other secure establishments. It inspects services for looked after children, safeguarding and child protection. [Contact:2325]"
/government/news/minister-praises-school-for-on-site-nursery-during-visit,"Toddlers benefiting from a Thamesmead pre-school operating from Willow Bank Primary School were visited by the Childcare Minister this morning (22 January 2015). Minister Sam Gyimah spent the morning at Toddles Wood Pre-School, which offers full-day care. The provision has worked in partnership with Willow Bank Primary School since 2012. The childcare help on offer to parents starts from the earliest stage thanks to on-site midwifery provision. Many of the children attending the pre-school go on to join Willow Bank Primary School when they reach statutory school age. Willow Bank Primary School worked in partnership with Bexley Borough to provide a new purpose-built building in which to base Toddles Wood Pre-School and NHS midwifery services. The new building opened in September 2014 and now provides sessions for a total of 90 2-, 3- and 4-year-olds. The government is committed to ensuring that all families, wherever they live, have access to high-quality, flexible and affordable childcare. Since September 2013 all 3- and 4-year-olds and some 2-year-olds across England have been entitled to 15 hours of funded early education per week. Childcare Minister Sam Gyimah said: It was fantastic to meet young children who are blossoming in the Toddles Wood Pre-School. Young children really benefit from good-quality early years education. Children who get it go on to be better equipped to join school, so adding nursery provision helps schools in the long run. No child should start school behind their peers. This is why as part of our plan for education we are committed to providing flexible, affordable and good-quality childcare, giving parents more choice about where they send their children. There are 27 2-year-old children at Toddles Wood Pre-School, of which 23 receive 15 hours of free childcare through the government’s 2-year-old offer, All 46 3-year-olds and 17 4-year-olds receive 15 hours of free childcare from the government. Although any primary school nursery is eligible for the funding, currently only 1% of funded 2-year-old places are delivered within a primary school setting. The minister was shown around the pre-school by Angela Barry, Executive Headteacher of the Woodland Academy Trust, accompanied by Jo Hayward, Headteacher of Willow Bank. Angela Barry said: Thanks to the midwifery, pre-school and primary school, we are involved in families’ lives from pre-birth until their child is 11. That joined-up approach has received really positive feedback from parents and we think that this is the way forward.

/government/news/grants-to-boost-childcare-start-ups,"Anyone who wants to set up a new nursery or childminding business can apply for grants of up to £500 to help cover the costs of things like training, equipment, insurance, and adaptations to premises. The money, part of a £2 million scheme launched in April 2013 , is helping to get over 1,000 new start-ups off the ground and get more mothers back into the workplace. Fledgling businesses are also being encouraged to team up with a free business mentor so they can access specially-tailored business start-up advice. Minister for Women and Equalities, Maria Miller said: “I know how good childcare and the peace of mind it brings can be such an important part of women returning to work. “This cash boost is helping people in tough times and providing more childcare options so that women who want to can get back to work. Equally, these grants are also providing a helping hand for more entrepreneurs to start-up and run their own businesses, adding to the country’s economic growth. It’s a double win. “If you think a childcare business is right for you, I would urge you to apply as soon as possible to get funding of your own.” Rachel Patchett received a grant in May and is now running her own child minding business at RAF Leeming. She said: “I heard about the grant through my local authority. It was super-easy to apply for and the money was in my bank account before the confirmation letter had a chance to arrive – the whole thing was done in a week. “The grant helped cover the cost of things including OFSTED fees, my CRB check, basic training, first aid and food hygiene, as well as professional membership and insurance. This meant I could then invest my own money in other things like equipment and toys. I would recommend the scheme to as many people as possible.” Welcoming the scheme, Purnima Tanuku OBE, Chief Executive of National Day Nurseries Association , said: “Good quality childcare is vitally important in a child’s development and a parent’s peace of mind if they choose to go back to work. Setting up a new business can be daunting it is vital people get the right support and advice. The Childcare Business Grants Scheme, helps people kick start their business and set them on the right path.” Liz Bayram, Chief Executive of the Professional Association for Childcare and Early Years , said: “These grants will provide a welcome contribution to childminders looking to establish and expand individual businesses. They may also provide some support for nurseries, for whom the cost of establishment is significantly higher. PACEY is keen to see that the grants are distributed effectively and are not subject to misuse. This means channelling funds to where vital support for increased childcare provision is most needed and for whom this provision is crucial, especially for families with disabled children.” Visit the childcare business scheme website to find out if you’re eligible to apply for a grant. Boosting childcare provision The grant scheme comes on top of a package of measures that government is taking forward to boost childcare provision and get more women into work, including: a new tax break for childcare costs, worth up to £1,200 per child per year overhauling childcare qualifications providing more choice of quality education and care for parents extending the right to request flexible working to all employees allowing parents to share up to a year’s leave to care for their newborn child Further information About the scheme and eligibility [InlineAttachment:1]"

/guidance/early-years-pupil-premium-guide-for-local-authorities,"The early years pupil premium ( EYPP ) is additional funding for early years settings to improve the education they provide for disadvantaged 3- and 4-year-olds. Early years providers are any organisation offering education for children aged under 5, including nurseries and childminders. You should involve your virtual school head ( VSH ) in identifying and funding the EYPP for looked-after children in your area . Eligibility 3- and 4-year-olds in state-funded early education will attract EYPP funding if they meet at least 1 of the following criteria: their family gets 1 of the following: Income Support income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance income-related Employment and Support Allowance support under part VI of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 the guaranteed element of State Pension Credit Child Tax Credit (provided they’re not also entitled to Working Tax Credit and have an annual gross income of no more than £16,190) Working Tax Credit run-on, which is paid for 4 weeks after they stop qualifying for Working Tax Credit Universal Credit they are currently being looked after by a local authority in England or Wales they have left care in England or Wales through: an adoption a special guardianship order a child arrangement order Children must receive free early education in order to attract EYPP funding. They do not have to take up the full 570 hours of early education they are entitled to in order to get EYPP . Children become eligible for free early education at different points in the year depending on when they turn 3. Details of the dates when children become eligible are available. Please note that 4-year-olds in primary school reception classes who already receive the school-age pupil premium are not eligible for EYPP funding. Identifying eligible children Early years providers are ultimately responsible for identifying eligible children. However, you should encourage providers to speak to parents to find out who is eligible for EYPP funding. In particular, providers should speak to the parents of children who took up the early education entitlement for 2-year-olds , as most of these children will attract EYPP when they turn 3. Eligibility checks You must check the eligibility of any child a parent or provider alerts you to. In most cases you will have to check twice: You should first check a child’s eligibility when a provider or parent tells you that a child may be eligible. If you wish to check a child’s eligibility before they begin to take up their free education entitlement, we suggest that you don’t do this more than a term in advance in case the family’s circumstances change. You should check the child’s eligibility again in the academic year when the child is taking up their 4-year-old entitlement. This check will help you find out if the child’s circumstances have changed and they have stopped being eligible as a result. We recommend carrying out this second check at the beginning of the academic year in September, but you can use a different date if you wish. In cases where a child becomes eligible when they are already 4 years old, you will not have to run a second check. When you check a child’s eligibility, you should inform the child’s parents or legal carers of the outcome of the check. You should also inform the early years provider where the child receives their early years education. You shouldn’t inform anyone else. Please be aware that once a child previously eligible for EYPP starts school they will not become automatically eligible for the school-age pupil premium. Eligibility checking system You can use our eligibility checking system ( ECS ) to check children’s eligibility for the EYPP . The Small, Business, Enterprise and Employment Act 2015 provides legal authority to use the ECS for this purpose. Checking the eligibility of children who have been in local-authority care You should follow a different process for identifying and checking the EYPP eligibility of children who: have been adopted from local-authority care have left care through a special guardianship order are subject to a child arrangements order You won’t be able to check these children’s eligibility through ECS . Instead, the parents, adoptive parents or guardians of these children will have to show you evidence of the court order that proves that the child was formally in local-authority care in either England or Wales. It will be your VSH ’s responsibility to identify the children who are currently in local authority-care . Funding for EYPP Financial year 2015 to 2016 In the financial year 2015 to 2016, we will base the initial amount of EYPP funding each local authority receives on an estimate of how many eligible children will take up their entitlement. We have calculated this estimate by looking at how many: 3- and 4-year-olds take up their entitlement to free early education in your area older children take up free school meals in your area The estimate of the amount of funding you will receive in the 2015 to 2016 financial year is available. In autumn 2015 we will collect data from local authorities about EYPP take-up. You should therefore record: how many eligible children in your area are taking up their entitlement to EYPP how many hours of early years provision these children are receiving the reason why these children are eligible This data will help us adjust the figures and make sure you receive the right amount of funding for 2015 to 2016. Financial year 2016 to 2017 onwards From January 2016, we will use the school census and early years census to collect information on: how many eligible children in your area are taking up their entitlement to EYPP the eligibility criteria these children meet We will use this data to calculate how much funding we give each local authority in future financial years. Distributing EYPP funding to early years providers National rate You must fund all eligible early years providers in your area at the national rate of 53p per hour per eligible pupil. You can find more information about this national rate in the School and Early Years Finance (England) Regulations 2014 . This means that in the financial year 2015 to 2016, providers will receive £302.10 for each eligible child who takes up the full 570 hours of state-funded early education they are entitled to. Distributing EYPP Please note that the way you should distribute EYPP funding for looked-after children is different. You should allocate the funding to early years providers based on: how many eligible pupils they have how many hours of state-funded early years education these children take up You can’t place conditions on the funding. This means that EYPP funding should follow the eligible child rather than the provider. If a child moves to a different provider part way through the year, they should not lose any of their funding because you will have calculated the amount of EYPP each provider gets based on the hours of take-up. You can treat the EYPP like other supplementary payments to the hourly rate set in your local early years single funding formula. For example, in cases where you fund the provider on a termly rather than an hourly basis (eg schools with early years provision), you can pay providers for one-third of the full early years entitlement (ie 190 hours’ worth of EYPP ) per eligible child per term. In cases where a child who lives in your area receives early education at a provider based in a different local authority, the provider’s local authority is responsible for: funding the EYPP for the child checking the child’s eligibility You may wish to offer providers extra funding for disadvantaged children who don’t meet the EYPP eligibility criteria . You may also wish to pay providers more than the national rate for children who attract EYPP . You will have to meet the costs out of your local resources if you do either of these things. Section 251 You must record details about how you distribute your EYPP allocations in the section 251 return . Eligible providers All early years providers who are eligible to receive funding for the 3- and 4-year-old early education entitlement are also eligible to receive the EYPP . However, if any of these providers receives an ‘inadequate’ rating from Ofsted, you must stop their early education funding (including EYPP ) as soon as practicable. More guidance is available in the ‘Early education and childcare’ statutory guidance for local authorities. Childminder agencies Childminders who are registered with a childminder agency receive their funding through that agency. You should pay the childminder’s EYPP to the agency and they will pass it on to the childminder. EYPP for children who are in local authority care Virtual school heads ( VSH ) are responsible for managing EYPP funding for looked-after children. The VSH in your local authority will be responsible for identifying the looked-after children who are eligible for EYPP funding. This will include any looked-after children who live in your local authority, even those who get their early years education with a provider based in a different local authority. You will receive EYPP funding for looked-after children through your dedicated schools grant. Once you have this funding, you should pass it on to your VSH . Guidance for VSHs on managing the EYPP is available."

/government/news/new-era-for-ofsted-inspection,"Speaking to over 400 headteachers, college principals and early years professionals, Sir Michael Wilshaw praised the achievements of great education leaders over recent decades and set out how changes to Ofsted inspection are designed to support further improvement in the system. The event, in London, is the first of 8 conferences around the country designed to share the details of the new inspection model with the sector. From September, Ofsted will inspect good schools and further education and skills providers once every 3 years under a new short inspection model. Inspectors will start from a premise that the school or provider is still good and focus on ensuring that those standards are being maintained. They will check that leaders have identified key areas of concern and that they have the capacity to address them. These short inspections will typically last one day and be led by one or two of Her Majesty’s Inspectors (HMI), with bigger teams for further education colleges. Where HMI feel more evidence is necessary to confirm the judgement, or to establish whether the school or provider may have improved or declined, the visit will be converted to a full inspection and continue, most commonly, for an additional day. Describing the nature of the new short inspections, Sir Michael said: “Make no mistake, this is a very different inspection model to what has gone before. “The starting assumption of Her Majesty’s Inspectors will be that the school or college is good. This should engender an atmosphere in which honest, challenging, professional dialogue can take place. “Leaders will have nothing to fear from accurately identifying at the outset any weaknesses in their provision - as well as the strengths - based on their own evaluation. HMI will be looking to see that the leadership has a clear understanding of the key areas for development - and a credible and effective plan for addressing these. “Short inspections will reduce the burden of inspection without losing the rigour which parents and the public rightly expect of Ofsted.” In his speech Sir Michael also announced plans to recognise ‘exceptional leaders’; outlining how, from September, when inspectors identify an early years leader, headteacher or college principal who has played a key role in turning around other institutions, Ofsted will send a letter to them acknowledging their leadership as exceptional. A copy of this letter will go to the Secretary of State and Ofsted’s Annual Report will also feature those leaders who have been recognised in this way. On the importance of recognising these achievements, Sir Michael said: “Those leaders who are taking risks, putting themselves out and disseminating good practice beyond their own institution need to be celebrated as exceptional reformers.” As well as short inspections for good schools and further education and skills providers, September will see a number of other changes. A common framework for inspection is being introduced encompassing registered early years settings, maintained schools, academies, non-association independent schools and further education and skills providers, so that common judgements and terminology can be used across all these sectors. A young person, parent or employer should be able to pick up any of Ofsted’s inspection reports and be able to understand them quickly because the format and judgements are the same. Sir Michael also announced his intention to open up Ofsted’s complaints process to greater accountability. Each Ofsted region will set up a ‘scrutiny committee’ made up of HMI and leading headteachers, early years and college leaders not involved in carrying out inspections for Ofsted. They will assess and rule on the internal reviews of complaints about inspection. The new school year will bring significant changes to the way Ofsted contracts with, trains and manages inspectors for schools and further education and skills providers. From September, Ofsted Inspectors, directly contracted by the inspectorate, will undertake inspections. Seven out of 10 of these inspectors will be serving practitioners from good and outstanding schools and colleges. All of their training, quality assurance and performance management will be directly overseen by HMI. Even higher quality and greater consistency will be Ofsted’s watchwords. Notes: The new inspection framework and associated materials , including videos of education leaders talking about their experience of the new inspection model are published online. Further conferences will held around the country over the next four weeks in: Birmingham, Leicester, Peterborough, Manchester, Bristol, Portsmouth and York. The Office for Standards in Education, Children’s Services and Skills (Ofsted) regulates and inspects to achieve excellence in the care of children and young people, and in education and skills for learners of all ages. It regulates and inspects childcare and children’s social care, and inspects the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service (Cafcass), academies, colleges, initial teacher training, work-based learning and skills training, adult and community learning, and education and training in prisons and other secure establishments. It inspects services for looked after children, safeguarding and child protection. [Contact:2325]"

/government/speeches/sarah-teather-to-the-4children-conference,"Thank you for inviting me here today and for your report, which is an extremely important contribution and I know is a culmination of a long piece of work and research. It is particularly useful ahead of next week’s spending review. I absolutely agree with your analysis. If we want to build any kind of society, let alone a big one, it needs to be built on units. The fundamental building block is family - families of all sizes, big, small, families that extend up through generations and horizontally too. All the elements of society exist in them. Many of society’s problems begin there and pass through generations. But so too are many of the solutions. As you say, families are a great untapped resource. So, if we are to build a big society, critical to our discussion is how we support families so they flourish and thrive. We need to look at removing the barriers that stop families thriving. This is the time for including families, and this is particularly true for the most vulnerable families. It’s the reason why so much of our focus has been and will continue to be on how we can support the most disadvantaged families. That’s why we’re making Sure Start children’s centres work better to help more families, recruiting extra health visitors, reforming the special educational needs system - because disabled children and their families have particularly important needs that can put a strain on family relationships, or making work pay to encourage people back into work. But the relentless top-down approach from Whitehall has not yielded all the results we want. People’s experience is of services being done to them and not taking account of them. They have been offered the wrong kind of help and there is a sense that they’re not being listened to. You can’t reach the most alienated families from a Whitehall office - we can’t do everything from the centre. We need to design services in a radically different way and encourage councils to think more innovatively. We need a different relationship with local government to fundamentally reshape the way we think about working with children and families. By removing ring fences on funding, changing how we deliver things and involving the voluntary sector more. This is especially important in Sure Start, where there is much more room for voluntary sector involvement. Penn Green, the children’s centre research centre I visited last week, has a fantastic track record of involving the community, and particularly parents. This is a model we need to learn from. But it is more than just about services. It is something bigger in vision - more difficult to achieve outright. Social capital is at the heart of what the Big Society is all about. It’s the links you have with others, the informal networks you are a part of that matter. Informal relationships offer people information, connections to work, sources of support. When relationships in your family get tough it’s the informal support networks that are key. Having somebody to talk to, other people who know what you are going through. The more disadvantaged you are, the fewer of those social links you have. Resilient families is what really matters. Building resilient families is partly about putting in place professional support and also about trying to create a society where people are less isolated - building communities - or putting in place the things that are needed so they build themselves, so that families of all types make connections with others. We need to create a society where people are less isolated - that’s the big vision. Children’s centres are at the heart of that, as well as churches, mosques, local clubs and even pubs - all provide ways to get to know people. Localising power down to local communities is not about getting things done for free, but about giving communities more power to find the solutions that are right for them."
/government/news/first-aid-training-to-be-made-compulsory-for-new-nursery-recruits,"The plans have received the support of parents Joanne and Dan Thompson, who have been campaigning for the change following the tragic death of their daughter, Millie, at nursery in October 2012. Their important campaign culminated in an e-petition signed by over 103,000 people. The new proposals will mean newly qualified staff with a childcare level 2 and 3 qualification must have an emergency paediatric first aid or full paediatric first aid certificate - a life-saving change that will add approximately 15,000 additional trained early years professionals to our nurseries and pre-schools each and every year. Mr and Mrs Thompson have also given their backing to the creation of a new special certificate - to be known as ‘Millie’s Mark’ - to be displayed by nurseries who have achieved gold-standard provision. The certificate will help to give parents assurance that their child is being cared for by safe and knowledgeable staff. It is hoped that over time the 2 initiatives announced today will help ensure that as many staff members as possible are trained in these important, life-saving skills. Childcare and Education Minister, Sam Gyimah said: As a parent myself, I know that every single mum and dad wants the confidence that those tasked with caring for their child have the right training should the absolute worst happen. Today’s proposals will mean that thousands more staff will be able to respond to emergencies more quickly, making sure parents really can access the very best possible childcare choices for their families. Not only will this help ensure children are safe while they learn, grow and develop, but it will also raise the quality and skills of the early years workforce to help them deal with day-to-day first aid issues, such as allergies and knowing when to call parents. Joanne and Dan Thompson said: We are both extremely pleased that the government have listened to our awareness campaign, and changes are being made that could ultimately save a child’s life. We are proud that these changes are being made in memory of our precious daughter and that her legacy continues to grow - but we are heartbroken that these changes are only coming into place because we lost her. The estimate of 15,000 new childcare workers entering the workplace with this specific qualification is fantastic news for parents and we fully support ‘Millie’s Mark’, and are looking forward to working with the specific government departments to help turn this into a reality. The government has also announced today (12 March 2015) that it is extending a special deal enabling schools to buy life-saving defibrillator machines at reduced prices to all early years settings, including holiday and out-of-school providers. Defibrillators are easy-to-use machines that could mean the difference between life and death for a child suffering from cardiac arrest. The machines work by delivering a controlled electric shock to the heart through sticky pads placed on the chest. The shocks interrupt the irregular heart rhythm that characterises a cardiac arrest, causing it to return to normal. Notes to editors The announcement on first aid training follows a review by the Department for Education, carried out in response to a petition by Joanne and Dan Thompson, the parents of Millie Thompson, who tragically passed away following a choking incident at her nursery in October 2012. The training proposals will be subject to a full consultation during the next Parliamentary session. The proposals are expected to come into effect by September 2016. The proposals will cover all early years settings except childminders. Under current rules, early years providers must have at least one paediatric first aider available on the premises at all times. The new requirement would mean that a nursery recruiting a level 2 or level 3 member of staff who had newly completed their early years/childcare qualification must have an emergency paediatric first aid or a full paediatric first aid certificate, if they are to count towards the staff/qualification ratios under the early years foundation stage. The emergency first aid training course would be the equivalent of 1 day of training and would need to be refreshed every 3 years in order for the staff member to keep counting in the ratios. To support early years providers to meet their responsibilities, we have funded the National Day Nurseries Association to produce case studies and guidance. The NDNA are today publishing 12 case studies, with more good-practice material for nurseries to follow later this month. The department will now look into the scope of Millie’s Mark and how it will be awarded. The scheme is expected to be up and running in early 2016. As they do currently, when Ofsted register and inspect early years providers they will check on the PFA certificates held by staff. In November 2014, the government announced details of a new deal to allow all UK schools to purchase automated external defibrillators ( AEDs ) at a reduced price . The only early years settings previously able to access these arrangements were maintained and independent nursery schools. Today’s announcement will extend the deal to: pre-school establishments private, voluntary and independent nurseries playgroups holiday and out-of-school providers.

/government/news/new-funding-will-help-most-disadvantaged-3-and-4-year-olds,"Schools, nurseries and childminders will be given up to £300 for every 3- and 4-year-old from a low-income family to help prevent them falling behind before they have even started school, the government has set out today (23 October 2014). The early years pupil premium, totalling £50 million, is designed to narrow the attainment gap between young children from low-income families and their peers, setting them on a path to a more successful future. In a response to an early years pupil premium and funding for 2-year-olds consultation published today, the government has also announced that 7 areas will share a £1 million pot to trial the new support ahead of its introduction nationwide next April. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said: It is vital that we intervene at the earliest possible stage and do all we can to help young children develop and learn. I’m so proud that we’ve been able to deliver this early years pupil premium so that toddlers from the poorest families get the support they need, which will pay dividends later in life. In my view, this will be one of the great legacies of this government, helping create a fairer society which benefits families up and down the country. Childcare and Education Minister Sam Gyimah said: Ensuring parents have access to affordable, flexible and high-quality early years provision is a key part of our plan for education. We know the first few years of a child’s life can be make or break in terms of how well they go on to do at school and beyond. We want to see this money being put to the best use to ensure that all children, whatever their background, are getting the best start in life. Nurseries will have the freedom to decide how to use the early years pupil premium to help 3- and 4-year-olds learn and develop, for example more qualified staff or specialists in activities like speech and language to give an extra focus on basic skills. The early years pupil premium builds on the pupil premium , established in 2011, to transform the way we educate children from low-income families. Alongside this announcement, the Department for Education has asked charity 4Children to launch a call for evidence on the early years pupil premium in November 2014 - asking providers to identify and share good practice around meeting the needs of disadvantaged children. The early years pupil premium is part of the government’s programme of reforms to help children get ready to begin school, especially those who are from low-income families. This includes: expanding 15 hours of free early education to 40% of 2-year-olds expanding the role that schools play in the early years tougher inspection and accountability through a stronger Ofsted framework improving the quality of staff entering the early years workforce by introducing early years teachers encouraging new providers into the market including through the introduction of childminder agencies reducing regulation to make it easier for new providers to open and existing ones to expand through the Small Business, Employment and Enterprise Bill Background See the early years pupil premium consultation response .

/government/speeches/childcare-minister-speaks-about-more-pre-schools-in-schools,"It is a pleasure to be here at Policy Exchange to speak to you as the first male childcare minister, something I only became aware of when an official drafted some copy in my name, and in it was a line that read, ‘I may be a man but I understand childcare’. I smiled when I read the line because I genuinely believe that childcare is an issue for ‘parents’ not just mothers. Childcare for me is also a personal issue. As new parent with a 6-month-old, I can honestly say I am living the early years. As I said to the Prime Minister - I am living inside the childcare model. Brought up by a single mother, a nurse who had to juggle her shifts with looking after 3 children under the age of 6 at one point, I saw from a very early age, the agonising decisions parents have to find a safe, secure and happy environment for their kids. I also remember my mother reading to me late into the night, sometimes against my will, because she believed that education, the only inheritance she could leave us, would take care of us and so she had to start early. So when I say, my mission as the new childcare minister is to help parents give their children the best start in life, I mean it, because I know the difference a good education can make to one’s life. My constituency has a high proportion of single earner families and so-called stay at home mothers - and I understand how hard they work. And I want parents to have a choice. Some families choose to look after children in the early years at home and we want them to have the widest choice possible. After all, when it comes to childcare, no one-size fits all. In my first few months in this new role, I found myself with my nose buried in Nursery World and Children and Young People Now magazines that are relatively new to me. At every site, I’ve been hugely impressed by the commitment and dedication of the people who work there. That hard work and dedication means we’re helping to ensure every child gets the best chance in life. But we can do more to help them improve young people’s life chances even further. And today I want to talk about our plan to give every parent the choice of a good school nursery. We will ensure that every parent who wants to can access a school nursery, and choose the provision that works for them. We don’t expect schools to have to do this alone. We can help. And we want to see schools teaming up with private, voluntary and independent nurseries, sharing the best ways to work between themselves. That way, families can have the flexibility of private nurseries and the expertise of schools. The best of both worlds. The benefits for children and parents Because we know that before they have knotted their school tie, fastened the laces on their shoes and headed off for their first day at school, a child’s life chances are already being decided. That’s how important early education is. It not only sets a child off on the right foot at school, but gives them a boost right throughout their life. Evidence shows that children who go to pre-school are projected to earn a staggering £27,000 more during their career than those who don’t. And they are more likely to get better GCSE results - the equivalent of getting 7 Bs instead of 7 Cs. On the other hand, we also know that the most disadvantaged 4-year-olds start primary school up to a year behind their peers from wealthier backgrounds. That’s why we are doing everything we can to give parents the choice of school nurseries alongside private ones. And it’s why we want more schools to step up to the plate and offer nursery provision. We want them to be innovative, curious and rise to the challenge. At the moment, 44% of primary and infant schools have nursery classes, yet only a few hundred take funded 2-year-olds. And those schools who do offer nursery provision are seeing some big benefits. Children’s behaviour and attainment improves, schools get to know children and their parents earlier on, offering them the tailored support they need, sooner. Rather than having to play catch-up when children from the most disadvantaged backgrounds arrive age 4, they can help these children before they fall behind. It means the transition to reception year is easier for everyone. And schools can strengthen the links they already have with the communities they serve. It’s not just the schools. Parents are seeing big benefits to this too. Parents like me who work, and parents who want to work but struggle due to the lack of suitable, flexible childcare. Offering flexible provision at a school is also appealing to those parents who are already dropping off their children at that school. What could be more convenient? All of these mean the most disadvantaged children also get a great start in life. Joined up nursery provision means parents may well be able to go back to work and children can access the help they need earlier on in life. Many schools already have most of the skills, the resources and the buildings they need to do this. And as we know, parents trust schools. Some schools are already doing it. Some have started bringing together nursery and reception into a single ‘foundation village’ to make it as easy as possible when children start school. So I want to see more schools making this offer. We know they want to support the children in their communities. This is one of the best ways of supporting them. And of course, schools can always team up with local nurseries, again strengthening those community links, to offer more nursery provision. Myth-busting and making the process easier I know there are some barriers to this. But these can be overcome. Schools might say it would be distracting to their core purpose, but the opposite is true. As I said earlier, it makes the move up to reception year much smoother and makes it easier to close the attainment gap between rich and poor pupils. Sometimes space can be a barrier. But this too can be overcome. I have heard of councils spending the £100 million of capital funding we gave them 2 years ago, to create tens of thousands of new places, many of them in school nurseries. And some have turned to more innovative methods to get past the space issue. Schools like Shortbrook Primary School in Sheffield, which successfully mixes its nursery age groups. They have dedicated areas for younger children to nap and so on, but by mixing, they can help those children develop and instil a caring attitude in the older children. But the area of greatest potential is in partnerships with onsite and nearby providers. This can save schools the need to develop and manage provision, or solve the problem of space, and it means that parents get the flexibility of private, voluntary and independent nurseries, with the expertise of schools. And so I want to see schools looking at ways they can offer high-quality, flexible nursery provision. We’re committed to helping schools do this - which is why we are cutting red tape and have made it easier for schools to lower their age ranges, and we are taking away the need for them to register separately to take 2-year-olds. And we are sharing knowledge and experience through our ‘two-year-olds in schools demonstrations project’, so we can draw out the best ways of opening schools up to 2-year-olds. Twenty six of the 49 schools that took part in the project are going on to champion 2-year-old provision, and helping other schools to step up and develop their own provision. And parents whose 2-year-olds took part in the project were overwhelmingly positive about it. Some said how drop-off and pick-up times had become easier as all their children were in the same place - and as a result have been able to go back to work. And the children enjoyed attending, their speech improved, and their social development was also boosted as a result. So there has been some great feedback already. To help more schools to be able to offer nursery provision, we are working with a number of schools in London as they develop their early years offer. We’re helping them stay open from 8am to 6pm in a way that parents can use their funded hours across the whole of the day. And a move from 9am to 3pm provision to 8am to 6pm is a 60% increase in hours. It means they can offer more part-time places for children, or enable children to stay all day, which helps working parents. In fact it will be transformative if we can move away from the situation we have at the moment, where office hours and school hours don’t match. This full-day care will make a huge difference to hardworking families. Not only will this increase the number of schools in the capital offering this sort of care, but also enables them to act as trailblazers who can share their knowledge and experience with others. Some schools say there is no demand for nursery provision among parents. If they really think that’s the case I challenge schools to check their assumption. Are parents just assuming the school would not offer places, so they are not asking? And I know some people say we are ‘schoolifying’ the early years, and that it is too much too soon. I don’t agree. Listening to some of the criticisms, you would imagine rows of small children lined up in classrooms, sitting in silence and learning about quadratic equations from a teacher. But I’ve seen school nurseries and I’ve seen the way they are run. They’re bright and cheerful. Children take part in messy play; they read together, sing and recite rhymes. Parents can still talk to a nursery worker and not book a meeting with a teacher, which is what happens at schools. At a nursery I visited last week, the children had a water fountain to float boats in. So it’s not about being taught in the same way as school kids. It’s about teaching children to socialise; to play together and to behave. It’s learning, but in an age-appropriate way. And the care is also of a high standard and appropriate for the children’s age. It has to be. School nurseries, of course, have to meet the same high standards as any other provider. Collaboration and partnership I hope one of the things you take from today is that we need to see more schools working with PVIs so they can learn from each other. We know there are great private, voluntary and independent providers out there and there is enough room for everyone. 4Children are piloting a series of hubs around the country, and with our support, they are bringing together all types of early years providers to work with schools. It means they are offering a range of options for parents that are flexible, co-ordinated and high quality. Effectively, they’re one-stop shops which are making information more available and up to-date for parents in one easy to access place. How we are helping Of course we want to help schools develop this provision. That’s why, today I want to tell you about the £5 million fund for Teaching Schools Alliances to bid into, that we have just launched. This will enable them to work with early years providers, both in schools and the PVI sector, to help drive up quality for parents, especially in disadvantaged areas. As I have already said, schools with great early years provision should be sharing their practice with others and offering support to those who are struggling. But this isn’t just about school-led support. Schools can also learn from the very best PVI providers, particularly when it comes to disadvantaged 2-year-olds. And a condition for bids was that the teaching school should show how the PVI sector will be involved in the project. When we announced this fund, we were very aware of the differences between the 2 types of provider. But I’m delighted to tell you that there have been 144 expressions of interest from across the country. We are looking at those bids now, and I look forward to telling you more soon. What this shows once again is that school and PVI collaboration and partnership is not only possible, but is already is happening in the early years. For example, St Bede Primary Academy in Bolton has its own on-site nursery. But they also have a subsidiary-run PVI on site too, and they now run a number of nurseries in the local area. And in Plymouth, schools there - helped by the local authority - have worked out several ways to work in partnership, both with each other and with PVIs . The same is happening in Blackburn, and I’m sure other areas will be able to learn from this. I want to see more schools being creative on how they deliver early years. Conclusion Because we know, providing high-quality, flexible childcare isn’t just important for children and their parents, but it benefits the whole of society. And of course we want parents to be confident that the childcare being provided is the very best for their child, preparing them for life in modern Britain. Which is why today, I want all schools to consider the nursery provision they can offer, and why this government wants to work with them to make it happen. As I said earlier, there are so many benefits to doing this, from making parents lives easier, to smoothing the transition to reception, to helping schools close the gap earlier. It’s why I’m proud to say that going forward, school-led nurseries will be at the heart of our plan for education. Once again, I want to thank all of you who have helped improve the life chances of our young children, and we need to keep up this momentum to benefit them and their families. Thank you."
/government/news/expert-family-organisations-to-deliver-parenting-classes-in-3-areas-of-the-country-from-this-spring,"The National Childbirth Trust, Save the Children, and the Fatherhood Institute are some of the experienced family organisations who will deliver parenting classes in three areas of the country from this spring. A coalition government trial starting in April will test out how to establish a new market in parenting classes for all parents. Over the next 2 years an offer of free universal parenting classes, face-to-face and online, will be available to all parents of children aged 5 years and under, in Middlesborough, High Peak in Derbyshire, and Camden in London. The classes are designed to strengthen parenting skills, and to encourage parents to feel that it is normal to get help in the first few years of their child’s life - just as they do in antenatal classes before their child is born. The government wants the trials to stimulate the market and increase demand for parenting classes across the country. The providers will offer a mix of classes, catered to different groups of parents, informed by evidence of what works best. All mothers and fathers in the trial areas with children five years and under will be entitled to a voucher covering the cost of a programme of parenting classes. Vouchers will be distributed by professionals working in the early years - for example, from nurseries, children’s centres, midwives and health visitors. Children’s Minister Sarah Teather said: Being a parent is one of the most important jobs you can do. Parents are the most important influence on a child’s healthy development and future lives. We know from the demand for self help books and from speaking to mums and dads that they would welcome light touch key advice and support from time to time. Most parents go to ante-natal classes before their child is born. We want parents to be able to seek help and advice in the earliest years of their child’s life and for this to be a normal part of family life. Unfortunately in some people’s minds there is a stigma attached to asking for help or attending parenting classes. So we have chosen a wide range of expert organisations, with a good track record of reaching out to parents of all backgrounds. They will attract and engage parents through a mixture of face-to-face and online classes, and in a variety of community settings including schools and children’s centres. The settings for classes need to be attractive and convenient to parents, and offered in a variety of locations. Fourteen providers are expected to lead delivery of the classes, some operating as a consortium with other partner organisations. Six organisations will deliver the classes in all three areas: National Childbirth Trust Family Links Save the Children Fatherhood Institute Solihull Approach Race Equality Foundation (with Mumsnet) Providers only in Camden: Montessori St Nicholas Mind Gym (Parent Gym) Coram City Literary Institute Only in Middlesbrough: Barnardo’s Only in High Peak: Derbyshire Council Family Lives Family Matters Institute The providers will be paid on a delivery basis only - they will be offered a concession contract which allows them to claim reimbursement for delivering classes to a voucher holding parent. Examples of classes include: Save the Children Families working with Family and Schools Together (FAST), a non-profit organisation that originated in the US and designs and distributes family strengthening and parent involvement programs. FAST will provide face-to-face parenting classes delivered in schools in all three trial areas, hoping to reach approximately 2,500 parents. FAST has a strong rating from the National Academy for Parenting Research. The National Childbirth Trust (NCT), a charity which helps parents in pregnancy, birth and early parenthood, and a well known provider of antenatal classes. NCT will offer five different courses for parents, delivered both face-to-face and online, including a baby specific course for parents with children under six months old. The courses will run over all three trial areas and will reach up to 3,000 parents over the course of the trial. The department is also finalising a contract with a consortium led by Ecorys, including Parenting UK and Orion Security Print to provide project management support and data collection for the trial and help with producing and distributing the parenting class vouchers. Notes to editors The parenting classes will be open for booking in Camden from April this year, and in all three areas by the end of May. Up to £5m has been made available for the trial between March 2012 and March 2014. This includes funding for redemption of parenting class vouchers; an independent evaluation; and the Local Support and Voucher Provider Services organisation. Research for the Department for Education in 2006 (Parents Direct: Proof of Concept, GfK NOP Social Research) found that nearly three-quarters of parents want regular access to information and advice on parenting. These findings are echoed in figures from Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents (2009) who found that 75% of parents would like more information on parenting. The classes are likely to cover: how to promote positive behaviour with better communication and listening skills managing conflict the importance of mothers and fathers working as a team, the appropriate play for age/development understanding the importance of boundaries and routines to children firm, fair and consistent approaches to discipline strengthening positive relationships in the family The three areas were chosen so that there was a good mix of locations and demographic spread across the country, with medium to high levels of deprivation. One area, High Peak, was chosen because it is also taking part in a trial to increase the number of health visitors working in children’s centres. The Local Support and Voucher Provider Services consortium is made up of: Ecorys, a research and consultancy organisation with previous experience of working across a range of sectors including health, transport, world finance and with not-for-profit organisations. They will have responsibility for overall project management, monitoring and data collection. Orion, leading the voucher development and distribution, has worked for high profile clients such as Manchester United and Glastonbury. They will have responsibility for designing the vouchers and leaflets storage, distribution and redemption. Parenting UK, a national membership body for the parenting workforce with excellent knowledge of the sector, and established links with foundation years workforce, is leading the local support element of the trial. They will have responsibility for supporting the delivery of classes, and sharing knowledge and best practice. [Contact:997]"
/government/publications/early-learning-for-two-year-olds-trials,"During 2012 to 2013 the department funded ten local authorities to offer early learning to those 2-year-olds, within specific localities, meeting the eligibility criteria due to be introduced nationally in September 2013. The local authorities took practical steps to overcome a range of challenges around supply, quality and parental demand. The overall aim of the trials was to enable local authorities to test how best to deliver early learning to all eligible children in a particular geographic area or areas.

/government/news/queens-birthday-honours-2014-education-and-childrens-services,"More than 90 people are today recognised for their service to education, children and families in the 2014 Queen’s Birthday Honours List. Six of those involved in education received knighthoods or damehoods, while nine have been given the British Empire Medal, a historic award revived for the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee in 2012. Chris Wormald, Permanent Secretary at the Department for Education, said: Congratulations to everyone working across the gamut of education and children’s services who have had their endeavours recognised in the Queen’s Birthday Honours List. Their impressive contribution is helping every child realise their potential, regardless of their background or circumstances. Those honoured today include teachers, carers and foster parents from across England. Susan Stamp, of South Ockendon, Essex, is awarded a British Empire Medal for services to education. A former primary teacher at Bonnygate Primary School, in South Ockendon, her colleagues say she is convinced that any child, irrespective of their home circumstances, can thrive if shown love, trust and belief. She put this into practice by spending countless hours before, during and after school, coaching young people and building up their confidence and self-esteem. While teaching she took her Grade 1 violin exam alongside her pupils in order to demonstrate to them her own aspirations for self-improvement. Retiring in 2008 to care for her mother, she returned to the school in 2010 to teach and mentor pupils voluntarily. Andrew Carter, of Tilford, Surrey, is knighted for services to education. As headteacher of South Farnham School for the last 24 years, Mr Carter has helped make it one of the best schools in England. Almost every single one of its pupils has achieved at least the expected level in both English and maths for the last five years. In 2010 he became a national leader of education and the school was designated a national support school. Since then he has helped improve more than 20 schools. Many of the teachers Mr Carter has recruited have gone on to become outstanding teachers and headteachers themselves. He is also chair of the Primary Academies Group in Surrey, supporting schools to convert to academies. He has written ‘School to Academy’, a guide to the conversion process. Barry Day, of Cropwell Bishop, Nottinghamshire, is knighted for services to education. As chief executive of the Greenwood Dale Foundation Trust (GDFT), Barry has experience managing 21 open academies. Prior to this he was the headteacher of Greenwood Dale School from 1991 to 2009. GDFT specialises in taking on challenging projects, including sponsoring Sinfin Community School, in Derby. He was appointed a National Leader in Education in 2007 and was awarded an OBE that year. He ran the SSAT ’s aspirant headteachers programme for six years, helping 1,800 aspirant senior leaders to become successful headteachers. Miriam and Victor Bennett, of Leeds, Yorkshire, are appointed MBEs for services to children and families. Over more than 40 years, the Bennetts have fostered hundreds of children, including those on short- and long-term stays, and emergency and pre-fostering children. Many of the children, now grown up, return to the Bennetts for visits with their own families. In 2007 Mrs Bennett was named Carer of the Year at the Pride of Britain Awards and also received a Local Heroes Pride of our Nation award from ITV Yorkshire. Ruth Diver, of Sheringham, Norfolk, is made an MBE for services to education after teaching at a special school for severely disabled children for nearly 40 years. At Sheringham Woodfields School, she teaches children with severe learning difficulties or autism. She also runs and personally subsidises school trips and raises funds for the school. She has raised more than £100,000 for Friends of Woodfields, which pays for extra equipment for the school’s pupils. Her colleagues say she constantly strives to achieve the best possible outcomes for her pupils, who face major barriers to their achievement. Beth Smith, of York, North Yorkshire, is made an MBE for services to education. For the past 7 years Beth has taught and inspired early years special educational needs pupils at the Forest School in Knaresborough, North Yorkshire. Beth has also been an outreach worker for autism for North Yorkshire County Council, supporting mainstream schools within the county to educate students with autistic spectrum disorder (ASD).

/government/speeches/elizabeth-truss-speaks-to-the-national-day-nurseries-association,"Thank you. I am very pleased to be at this interesting venue and to get out of Westminster. It can sometimes feel like a bit of a bubble. And I know Purnima (Tanuku, Chief Executive of National Day Nurseries Association) spends quite a lot of time in Westminster, I’m sure she agrees with me on that. The other week I went to visit a Busy Bees nursery on Horseferry Road. I thought I would escape from some of my fellow politicians and spend the morning chatting with people working at the nursery, play with some jelly maybe, and read some stories to children. And I had a fantastic time at the nursery. They have an excellent chef there, who produces all the meals from scratch, and they looked delicious actually. Anyway, so I was trying to escape politics. But what I saw the minute I walked in the door - I think it was the first person I saw - was a politician from another political party dropping his son off at the nursery. And then I saw the director of a think tank dropping her daughter off at the nursery. So much for getting away from politics, and in fact the nursery is actually part of the Home Office. What this really brought to life to me is how everybody now relies on childcare and nurseries, whatever profession you work in: whether you work in politics, whether you’re in business, whatever you do for a living, it’s something that’s now universal, that we regard as part and parcel of our everyday lives. And this is a trend across the world. In every leading country now, dual-income families are the norm, day nurseries are a really key part of what we all rely on as citizens, both to support our working lives but also to make sure that our children are developing well, benefitting from early education, and benefitting from early learning. There’s been a lot of debate recently about the issue of stay-at-home mothers. At the moment in Britain, 67% of mothers - two-thirds of mums - go out to work, for a lot of families it’s an absolute necessity. We know that we’re living in difficult economic times and parents rely on what you do. So I completely agree with Purnima, you do a fantastic job across the country, we absolutely rely on what you do, and we’re very keen as a government to work with Purnima and the NDNA on how we can make things better and definitely get more money to the front line. Now I did mention mothers being employed, but I think it’s important to mention the increased role that fathers have in bringing up children and taking responsibility for doing things like organising childcare. My colleague Matthew Hancock - who’s the Skills Minister - has just gone on paternity leave and I like to see him as a pilot of our new shared parental leave policy. He’s taking a few months off - he got a bit of flak for that - which I think is wrong because it’s so important that we support what modern families want to do and we support the choices that they make, whether that’s staying at home, whether that’s having good quality childcare, whether that’s sharing parental leave between mums and dads. We need to give people those choices and those flexibilities and those options because we know modern life is very fast, it can be tough and it’s really important that people have that support. The importance of early years As I’ve said, we are committed to affordability, and the availability of high-quality early years education and childcare. We know that how a child’s brain develops in the first years of their life has a massive and enduring impact on the rest of their life. In fact the brain is 80% developed by the age of 3. The MPs Andrea Leadsom, Frank Field and Graham Allen - along with George Hosking of the WAVE Trust - have all published thoroughly-researched reports that reveal how huge a difference high-quality early years education makes, not least to disadvantaged children. All the evidence from across the world shows the value of a good early education. The Sutton Trust has found a 19-month vocabulary gap between the poorest and richest children at the age of 5. Our teenagers are well behind those in Hong Kong and Singapore for maths - but that gap is already present by age 5. The early years is so important and so vital. Vocabulary at age 5 is the best predictor of later social mobility for children from deprived backgrounds. Sir Michael Wilshaw, head of Ofsted, has rightly said that “too many children - especially those that are poor,” are “not well enough prepared for school, particularly in key skills such as communication, language and literacy”. In fact a third of children start school without basic language and communication skills. In poorer areas, this rises to more than a half. And what’s particularly worrying is that although we have very high take-up of our 3- and 4-year-old education places, the take-up is much lower amongst those from very deprived backgrounds. So it’s the children who need it most who are benefitting least. Our pilot for 2-year-olds showed that higher-quality settings have a positive impact the language ability of 3-year-olds, whereas those who are not high-quality don’t. And parents have told us that higher-quality settings improved their own skills. I think working with parents is a really important role of nurseries as well as working with children. Andreas Schleicher of the OECD has written that “staff qualifications are one of the strongest predictors of the quality of early childhood education and care.” One of the things that really concerns me as a minister - and I know that Purnima has just been talking about cost - is the massive differential we still have in salaries between early years and primary school. That isn’t the case elsewhere and I don’t think it’s right that the average primary school teacher is earning £33,000 and the average person working in childcare earns £13,000. I don’t think that gap is justifiable, particularly as we know the massive impact that high-quality early years education can have. Changes to Ofsted Ofsted are changing the inspection and regulatory regime, to make it both more comprehensive and more focused. Ofsted will increase the number of HMIs covering the early years. They’re recruiting at the moment, they’ve already recruited new staff, to make sure the quality of inspectors is what it should be. As professionals you deserve to have inspectors who are highly-qualified, know what they’re doing, and can do a good job. I know Sir Michael is very committed to recruiting them and the Department for Education has given Ofsted additional budget to recruit those inspectors because it was one of the weaknesses. There were not sufficient numbers of HMI inspectors in the early years. Starting from this September, Ofsted has been recording the qualifications that providers have, to focus more on that specific outcome. From September last year, Ofsted has been structured in a regional way, with HMIs in each region dedicated to that region, meaning that there will be much more insight into the quality of local provision, which I think is really good. There are 8 regions, each of which has a director. Their numbers include an executive headteacher and a very experienced Director of Children’s Services. Regional variations in the quality of early years provision are too wide. In some local authorities 80% of early years providers were judged ‘good’ or ‘outstanding’ at their last inspection, but in others it was less than 60%. And we want to make sure that we have universal standards that are common across the country. Local authorities have a very important role to play in attracting high-quality providers to their areas. The new regional structure of Ofsted will mean it is easier for Ofsted to work with local authorities. From some nurseries I’ve heard that there are sometimes mixed messages, so providers will get different messages from the local authority than from Ofsted. It’s really important there are clear messages so that you know as providers what’s expected from you. In ‘More great childcare’ we promised to increase the role and number of HMIs who are dedicated to early years. One of their roles is running ‘getting to good’ seminars. These will look at how a provider improves quality and meets Ofsted requirements - and work with weaker providers. Another, related, role is in helping to broker links between weaker providers and good ones - be they nurseries, schools or children’s centres. I do want to reassure you that I recognise that we need to be fairer to nurseries, and more consistent. That is something we are working on. It’s obviously a gradual process in terms of recruiting those people, getting more consistency, as with any change in government it doesn’t necessarily happen overnight, but we are working on that because we think it’s really important. Another way in which we will make the system fairer is by creating a new route for paid-for re-inspection. As Purnima mentioned, the Ofsted judgement is really important for a nursery and can have a strong impact on the sustainability of your business. So if a nursery that received a ‘satisfactory’ rating has taken steps to reach ‘good’ or ‘outstanding’, this must be recognised and promptly updated so you don’t have to wait so long for the next inspection. I’m sure Sue (Gregory, Ofsted’s National Director of Early Years) will have more to say about this when she speaks to you. Local authorities By having Ofsted focus on inspection and regulation, local authorities will be able to concentrate on encouraging high-quality provision in their area. Where providers still value the training and support they receive from local authorities, local authorities will still have an important role to play with those providers. They also need to ensure that children are taking up places to which they are entitled, especially those from more disadvantaged backgrounds. Local authorities and their local agencies - whether it is the family information services or Sure Start children’s centres - have a vital role to play in ensuring that all eligible parents understand what their child is entitled to, and get the support they need to access their child’s place. Children’s centres primarily support families’ emotional resilience by providing services for child development, parenting, and raising family aspirations. And we’ve listened to those of you who have said there does need to be more consistency between these different organisations working together. Funding One thing we’re doing about funding - and we’ve had some comments about how much funding is going to the front line - is introducing a tax-free childcare scheme, which will be an online scheme. One of the issues at the moment with the childcare vouchers is an awful lot of those vouchers is taken up in administration. The new tax-free childcare scheme will be much more efficient. The administration costs will be more like 2 or 3%, rather than a third of the cost. It will be an easy system for parents to access online and far more parents will benefit than do at the moment. At the moment only 5% of employers offer the employer vouchers. It’s also difficult because it’s based on the household rather than the child, so at the moment if you’re in a household where 2 parents are eligible for vouchers with 1 child, you’ll get paid twice, but if you’re in a household where only 1 parent is eligible for the vouchers and you have 2 children, then you’ll only get paid once. We don’t think that’s fair. We think it should be on the basis of per-child, which makes it more similar to the early years funding. And it will be a universal offer. Those parents on low incomes will continue to get 70% of their childcare costs paid, through universal credit, so we will have a system where if you’re in a middle or a higher income you’ll get 20% of your costs, if you’re on a lower income you’ll get 70% of your costs paid. One of the issues is setting up the IT system, which is always an interesting prospect, when it comes to government IT, so that’s why we will only be able to introduce the scheme in 2015. We want to get it right; we are working with providers - I think it’s very important that you’re all involved so it’s an easy scheme for providers to work, as well as the parents who are going to be using it. The other thing we are working on is trying to improve the transparency and simplicity of the funding that we provide through the early years education offer through the Department of Education. We do want to maximise the amount of funding reaching the front line. I’ve had a lot of representations on this from nurseries. There is clearly unfairness in the system, about the amount that different local authorities get. One of the things we’re doing is getting more transparency on that, so currently we are getting data from local authorities about exactly what they’re paying for different types of provider. That will help us analyse the situation better, because one of the issues we struggle with is that the Department for Education pays money to local authorities, they then devise their own funding rates, so we don’t know at present how much is going through to providers so at least we will have more information. And we’ve already gathered that information and we’re cleaning up the data at the moment, so we’ll be able to do that. Nurseries need a clear, single rate so that they can determine whether to want to be part of the offer. We were able to announce last November what each local authority would be given to implement early learning for 2-year-olds. We also published estimates of how many children would be eligible in each area. It’s not a perfect system but I think it’s an improvement on transparency on the previous system. The national rate is £5.09 an hour, which outstrips the £4.26 an hour that the Daycare Trust has found to be the average charge for a place. This equates to a premium of around £475 a year for each place. There’s a round £150 million in trajectory building funding and £100 million in capital for local authorities being made available too, which will support the expansion of Early Learning in 2014, the criteria and details for which we will be announcing shortly. As I’ve mentioned, we are now collecting data for 3- and 4-year-olds to try and improve the delivery of early education places. I’ll be working with bodies like the NDNA on that. I think it’s really important that providers are clear about the funding available in each local authority. I also want to have more of a dialogue with nurseries about costs. One of the issues we’ve got is estimating the cost of a childcare place in different parts of the country. There will obviously be some providers who do things differently from other providers. What we’ve been doing at the Department for Education is our economists have been working on a costing model, a bottom-up model, actually looking at staffing costs, ancillary costs, premises costs and so on. And I’d be very interested, Purnima, in facilitating a discussion with you and your organisation so nurseries can go into the Department for Education and see economists and talk about the cost-base. When we’ve got proper information from the local authorities about what they’re paying out, and good information from nurseries about their cost-base, that’s the way we can start to get to the bottom of making sure the funding is more efficient. The importance of collaboration I also think it’s important that parents have a choice of different types of provision and that we have more collaboration between them. So nurseries, childminders, and schools. Childminder numbers - and especially the number of younger childminders - have fallen over the last 20 years. We are working on a policy of childminder agencies to improve the numbers of childminders and provide a high-training, high-quality access route into the profession. Agencies will be inspected by Ofsted, and be a source of business and other practical help. They will be self-financing and independent of government. It will not be obligatory to join them, but new childminders - and many existing ones - may well find that agencies offer a support network and a more secure way of working. Over 60 organisations have expressed an interest in working with us to trial elements of childminder agencies. They are a mix ranging from nursery chains to individual childminders, academies, maintained schools, national childcare organisations, children’s centres and local authorities. We’re going to be working on testing out the concept, testing out the business model, and the regulatory system. But I can reassure you that Ofsted will be keeping a very close eye on the childminders within those agencies to make sure that quality is maintained during that process. Once we’ve completed the trials we will then consult on the regulation around childminder agencies. Those who remain independent will not be formally or informally compelled to join an agency. But I strongly hope that this will increase the number of childminders in our system and also more of a seamless service for parents will be very attractive. It will also provide a one-stop shop for parents where they want it. I also want us to see more collaboration between schools and private, voluntary and independent nurseries. I know this does happen where schools will have an offer for age 4 and up, and they will also have a PVI provider onsite. I know it works very well at present. I recently visited the free school in Norwich which offers onsite, affordable childcare as part of their pre-school and post-school service. They collaborate with the local nursery, so the nursery provides staff for the after-school club and the pre-school club. It’s called the Squirrels Club and it works very well and they’ve adjusted their shift patterns to cope with the work at the school and the work at the nursery. I think some of these models are very interesting for busy parents who may have a younger child and an older child and would like a single site to operate on. I see really strong scope for more collaboration between the PVI sector and schools offering seamless provision for parents. The other thing about the Norwich free school is that it is open for 51 weeks of the year, which I know will be no surprise to anybody in this room but it is quite unusual in the schools sector. We’re also looking at engaging businesses and other organisations in childcare and again I know this happens frequently, and I quoted the case of the Home Office earlier. But other organisations have a strong interest in making sure that parents have access to high-quality childcare. Rainbows nursery, which is part of RAF Marham in my constituency - and which was set up by the RAF itself - is absolutely brilliant. It’s a really good example of how nurseries can cater to the particular needs of parents. Quite often these children will find that their mother or father is going away for quite long deployments and the nursery staff is specifically trained to deal with these issues. I think it’s a really good example of how an employer can collaborate with an independent nursery to create a really good setting that suits those children and those parents. Encouraging more people to enter early years We now have more graduates than ever before in early years, and we are continuing to invest in and raise the profile of early years as an area where it is aspirational to work. There are 12,000 early years professionals, and we will build on what they have achieved as we move to the early years teacher model. Of course, anyone who works with children needs a wide range of qualities, not all of these can be quantified by degrees or diplomas. I know that there are lots of brilliant people working in early years all over the country that don’t necessarily have the qualifications. Yet that does not undermine the case for greater skills and better qualifications. What I want to make sure is that we recognise the diversity of provision within the qualifications we’re creating, like early years teachers and early years educators. So for example this week I was talking to some people from Montessori about how we could make sure some of their qualifications could be recognised by us as part of the system. We want to have very high quality and very high standards but we want to allow flexibility of practice. So we have different types of nurseries and parents have a choice about what they’re getting. It is absolutely vital that we bring a greater number of highly-qualified individuals into the early years. This is why we are championing early years teachers. Early years teachers will be specifically trained to work with babies and young children. The first programme begins this September. We’ve already been consulting on the criteria. Trainees will need to meet the same requirements as trainee primary school teachers: a degree and passing English and maths tests. The National College for Teaching and Leadership has consulted on the new Teachers Standards, and they will be published in July. Early years teachers will support and lead other staff. Charlie Taylor, the Chief Executive of the National College for Teaching and Leadership, was due to speak to you tomorrow. I am very sorry he can’t be here, and I know he is too. He is an inspirational character and I think you would have really enjoyed his talk. I know that you have probably met him, but Charlie has done a brilliant job in raising the profile of teaching overall, and he really wants to make sure there is more of a presence of the National College in the early years. He sees that as a core part of his job, which is really important. I hope we can fix up another date for him to address the NDNA because he has a really inspiring vision which I think it would be great to hear more about. Teach First has been incredibly successful in bringing talented new people into schools. From this September it will include 3- and 4-year-olds. Teach First graduates can make a big contribution, especially in disadvantaged areas. What we’re trying to do is make sure that education is seen as a continuum. I’d like to see Teach First come into other settings apart from school settings, and make sure that this area has a really high profile. Early education qualifications have been far too diffuse and lacking in rigour. There are hundreds of existing and historic early years qualifications. The National College for Teaching and Leadership has consulted on new criteria for Early Years Educator Level 3 qualifications, and will publish them soon. Awarding organisations will then start developing higher quality qualifications to be introduced in September 2014. The new criteria will not be applied retrospectively, so current practitioners will not be unfairly disadvantaged. Early years educators will be qualified at level 3. Apprenticeships will offer a high quality route to becoming one. Lasting 20 months on average, they will combine employment with study towards recognised qualifications. Those students will need C grades or better in English and maths. Early years educator qualifications will be introduced in 2014, and we have put in place a transitional measure to run ahead of that. We expect that early years educators will often assist early years teachers. Training courses will be expected to include a lot of practical work experience in good quality workplaces. We will work with further education and trainers to improve standards. This September we are also putting £2 million towards a bursary scheme, for a level 3 early years Advanced Apprenticeship for the Children and Young People’s Workforce. There will be up to 1,000 places, with each bursary worth £1,500, plus an additional £300 for more training to work with 2-year-olds. The bursaries are available from this September this year. This is a transitional measure until September 2014, when the new early years educator qualification comes in. Applicants need to locate an apprenticeship position with a provider that works in early education for 2-year-olds. And they will also need a C grade or better in GCSE English and maths. The scheme will be run by the National College for Teaching and Leadership and is open to people of all ages. I very much encourage everyone in this room to get involved. More details about how to apply for all of these schemes can be found on the DfE website. The College of West Anglia in King’s Lynn says that there is a big demand for such apprenticeships, which is really encouraging. They’ve noticed a real increase in the number of students wanting to work in the early years. They think this will be even more of a boost. Conclusion We know important having high-quality, affordable available childcare is. It’s getting more and more important. The salience of it in terms of political debate shows that. We can work together to make sure that the money the government’s spending, which is over £5 billion, works better in the system. We can work together to make sure more of it is going to the front line, more of it is going into high-quality provision. I also think we can simplify things. At the moment there is a great deal of complexity. When I became early years education minister lifting the bonnet was quite an experience - just seeing how complex it is! I want to make it easier for high-quality operators to open in the nursery sector and be financially sustainable because I think that is what’s good for children, that is what’s good for parents, and that is what’s good for our country. Thank you very much."
/government/speeches/primary-and-16-to-19-assessment-and-accountability,"I am today announcing the final elements of our schools accountability reform programme: reforms to primary and 16 to 19 accountability from 2016. This builds on our plans for secondary school accountability. Progress will now be the most important way in which we will hold schools and colleges to account. The new accountability system will be fairer, measuring the progress that students make while at school or college. This ensures that all students receive equal attention: we will measure the progress that all students make whatever their starting point. This will prevent the unfair focus on those at threshold borderlines. To help all parents and students to compare schools and colleges, we will require all schools and colleges to publish the key information for primary, secondary and 16 to 19 phases on their websites in a standard format. This information will clearly show the progress that students make, their attainment and how well they do in English and mathematics. Primary We are resetting the standard for success for primary schools. Expectations are currently too low (level 4c in English and mathematics). In 2012, fewer than half the pupils who had only just reached this expected standard went on to achieve 5 good GCSEs. Under the new system, we will expect schools to support at least 85% of their pupils to achieve a new higher standard (closer to the present 4b level). With the continued improvement in teaching, the sharper focus of the new curriculum and increased funding, results should rise. We have invested through the pupil premium so that schools can give disadvantaged pupils the help they need. With more than 1.1 million pupils from reception to year 6 currently benefiting, schools receive £953 for each primary-age pupil rising to £1300 from April 2014. To judge schools’ progress more fairly, we will work with experts to introduce a new assessment taken during reception as the baseline. This will sit within teachers’ broader ongoing assessments of children’s development and progress throughout reception. The reception baseline will be used to assess schools’ progress for children who start reception in September 2016 and beyond. Schools that choose not to use an approved baseline assessment from 2016 will be judged on the 85% attainment standard alone. From September 2016, the early years foundation stage ( EYFS ) profile will no longer be compulsory. The EYFS will continue to be statutory and the basis for Ofsted inspection of early year settings including children in a school nursery and reception classes, thereby ensuring children receive a broad education and are able to learn and thrive in school. I can also confirm today that the grammar, punctuation and spelling test will not form part of the primary floor standard in 2014. 16 to 19 Our changes to 16 to 19 accountability support the reforms we have already made to improve the quality of 16 to 19 education and training. The introduction of study programmes and traineeships last September, the reforms to A levels and vocational qualifications and the emphasis on English and mathematics support our ambitions to make sure that students in this country can compete with the best in the world. We will introduce new, fairer minimum standards for 16 to 19 providers. Wherever data allows it we will use progress measures. This will apply to academic and applied general qualifications. Where the data is not robust enough, we will use a combined completion and attainment measure. We will introduce 5 headline measures of performance for all 16 to 19 providers to give a broader picture of educational outcomes than attainment alone. These headline measures include: progress measures attainment measures retention measures English and mathematics progress measures for those who did not achieve good grades at age 16 destination measures Conclusion We believe that the single most important outcome for any school or college is to give as many students as possible the knowledge and skills to flourish in the later phases of education and life. The reforms that I have set out today set the framework for schools and colleges to meet this challenge: ensuring all children move on to secondary school ready to succeed and all 16 to 19 students can move into further or higher education or employment."
/government/news/coalition-government-to-reward-local-authorities-for-improving-childrens-lives,"Children and Families Minister Sarah Teather today announced that trial local authorities will test a range of measures which aim to reinforce the role of Sure Start Children’s Centres in improving outcomes for all children, while focusing on reaching those who can most benefit from their services. The announcement comes on the day the Department began a consultation on Sure Start Children’s Centres Statutory Guidance. The draft revised guidance sets out that local authorities must have sufficient children’s centres to meet the needs of young children and parents living in the area, particularly those in greatest need of support. The purpose of payment by results is to reward progress against the main aim of Sure Start: to reduce inequalities in child development, school readiness, health and life chances, and to improve parenting aspiration and skills. The measures announced today for the payment by results trials are: Increasing the school readiness of young children by: Narrowing the gap in attainment through the Early Years Foundation Stage Profile. Increasing take up of the two year old free entitlement. Increasing take up of early education amongst disadvantaged three year olds. Improving health and child development by: Increasing the prevalence of Breastfeeding at 6-8 weeks. Improving parenting skills and support provided to families in need of children’s centre services by: Increasing the proportion of families in greatest need completing evidence based parenting programmes. Increasing the proportion of families with children under 5 years who are identified as being “in greatest need” and have “sustained contact” with children’s centres in the local authority area. Local authorities running the trials are also developing local measures to test payment by results arrangements with their children’s centres. The trials will be evaluated to inform a decision about potential national rollout and the most suitable measures for a national payment by results scheme. Children’s Minister Sarah Teather said: We know high quality early years support can have a lasting impact on children’s lives and we are committed to maintaining a national network of Sure Start centres that help families in greatest need. We understand that local authorities are facing difficult decisions. Our revised guidance makes clear that they should concentrate on improving outcomes for some of the most disadvantaged young people and families. It is about the quality of services to support children and families, particularly the most disadvantaged. I want our payment by results approach to incentivise local authorities to reduce inequality. It will reward local areas for targeting those who will benefit most from the excellent support children’s centres can offer. Notes to editors A consultation on Sure Start Children’s Centres Statutory Guidance can be found on the consultations page of the Department for Education’s website. A small group of local authorities, children’s centre leaders and representatives of the voluntary and community sector, were consulted during the production of the guidance. Payment by results is part of the Coalition Government’s approach to developing open public services which devolve responsibility to the lowest level to meet local needs, are transparent and accountable and achieve value for money. Payment by results is currently being trialled in 26 areas. We plan to use the evidence from the trials to inform decisions on potential national rollout. The trial offers an opportunity to find out what works. Later this year we will announce how the trial reward system will work so trial LAs understand the potential level of reward they could achieve. The revised guidance implements a number of the Coalition Government’s commitments to reform children’s centres and sets out the outcomes they should strive for. The strengthening of the guidance follows other measures to reduce bureaucracy relating to Sure Start. The Early Intervention Grant gives local authorities the freedom and flexibility to make the best decisions for the families in their communities. [Contact:997]"
/government/news/new-phonics-check-will-identify-thousands-of-children-needing-extra-reading-help,"Study finds the short check is popular with pupils Thousands of children will receive the extra support they need to become confident, fluent readers thanks to the Department for Education’s new phonics check, an independent study today reveals. In a pilot, 43% of teachers said they had been able to pinpoint 6-year-old pupils with reading problems of which they were not previously aware. Those children will now be given additional support to improve. The study of the pilot also found that: the majority of teachers found most aspects of the check appropriate; most pupils found the check to be a positive experience; it took on average between four and nine minutes for each pupil to complete. The check, supported by three-quarters of parents in a survey by the National Confederation of Parent Teacher Associations, was piloted in 300 schools this summer and will be rolled out across England next year. All Year 1 pupils will be screened between 18 and 22 June 2012. The check involves teachers taking pupils through a booklet of 40 words on a one-to-one basis. If the pilot’s success rate is replicated when it is rolled out, thousands more teachers will be able to identify children who need extra reading help. In this year’s tests for pupils leaving primary school: 1-in-6 11-year-olds did not reach the reading standard expected. 1-in-10 boys aged 11 can read no better than a 7-year-old. England has also slipped down the international table for reading in primary schools. The Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS) of 10-year-olds saw England fall from third out of 35 countries in 2001 to 15th out of 40 countries in 2006. Schools Minister Nick Gibb said: Ensuring that every child leaves primary school as a fluent and confident reader is key to raising academic standards overall and is important in closing the attainment gap between those from poorer and wealthier backgrounds. It is unacceptable that 10% of boys aged 11 can read no better than a 7-year-old. The new check is based on a method that is internationally proven to help children learn to read and the evidence from the pilot is clear - thousands of 6-year-olds, who would otherwise slip through the net, will get the extra reading help they need to become good readers, to flourish at secondary school and to enjoy a lifetime’s love of reading. This study finds that the check will be of real benefit to pupils but takes just a few minutes to carry out and is a positive experience for most children. High-quality academic research from across the world shows that the systematic teaching of synthetic phonics is the best way to teach children to read, especially those aged 5 to 7. The main findings of the study, carried out by the Centre for Education and Inclusion Research (CEIR) at Sheffield Hallam University for the Department for Education, are that: 43% of pilot schools were able to identify pupils with phonics problems of which they were not already aware. all aspects of the check were seen as appropriate by at least 74% of teachers. Three-quarters of pilot schools said the check assessed phonic decoding ability accurately. Most schools interviewed in the pilot also plan to use the results to inform their teaching and planning. Most teachers and pupils understood the purpose of the check correctly. More than 90% of teachers said the content of the check was suitable on most levels. 83% of teachers said the number of words was suitable; 80% said the type of vocabulary was suitable; and 74% thought the non-words used were suitable. The check took on average three hours for schools to prepare for the check, and 12-and-a-half hours to administer it. 65% of schools found the resources used to administer the check “straightforward” or “very straightforward” to manage. 89% of pilot schools said the guidance provided to them by the Department for Education was ‘useful’ or ‘very useful’. Pilot schools wanted detailed results of the check. Almost all 97% wanted pupil-level results and 88% wanted commentary on national-level results. Some 90% of schools wanted benchmarking data to help them set appropriate expectations for their pupils. The experience of the check was positive for most pupils. Some 62% of pilot schools felt the experience had been positive for all pupils, while 31% said it was neither positive nor negative. The check took on average between 4 and 9 minutes to complete per pupil. Nick Gibb added: Overall the report provides sufficient evidence to roll out the check nationally next year. There are also some helpful suggestions from teachers, and we will consider making some amendments to the check when it is introduced for all Year 1 pupils next summer. The Department for Education is also launching a catalogue of approved phonics resources for teaching pupils and training teachers. Primary schools with Key Stage 1 pupils will be able to claim up to £3,000, if they match that funding, to spend on these approved materials. Schools will decide which of the resources will help them to deliver high-quality phonics teaching for their pupils and will be able to buy products and training with the match-funding any time up to March 2013. How phonics works Phonics focuses on sounds rather than, for example, having children try to recognise whole words. In analytic phonics, words are broken down into their beginning and end parts, such as ‘str-‘ and ‘eet’, with an emphasis on ‘seeing’ the words and analogy with other words. In synthetic phonics, children start by sequencing the individual sounds in words - for example, ‘s-t-r-ee-t’, with an emphasis on blending them together. Once they have learned all these, they progress to reading books. The ‘synthetic’ part comes from the word ‘synthesise’, meaning to assemble or blend together. Children who learn using synthetic phonics are able to try new words working from sound alone, whereas those using analytic phonics are more dependent on having prior knowledge of families of words. High-quality research evidence In Clackmannanshire, Scotland, a seven-year study of the teaching of synthetic phonics to 300 children found they made more progress in reading and spelling than other children their age. A 2005 Australian report, Teaching Reading, said: The incontrovertible finding from the extensive body of local and international evidence-based literacy research is that for children during the early years of schooling (and subsequently if needed) to be able to link their knowledge of spoken language to their knowledge of written language, they must first master the alphabetic code - the system of grapheme-phoneme correspondences that link written words to their pronunciations. Because these are both foundational and essential skills for the development of competence in reading, writing and spelling, they must be taught explicitly, systematically, early and well. The US National Reading Panel report of 2006 said: Systematic synthetic phonics instruction had a positive and significant effect on disabled readers’ reading skills. These children improved substantially in their ability to read words and showed significant, albeit small, gains in their ability to process text as a result of systematic synthetic phonics instruction. This type of phonics instruction benefits both students with learning disabilities and low-achieving students who are not disabled. Moreover, systematic synthetic phonics instruction was significantly more effective in improving low socio-economic status (SES) children’s alphabetic knowledge and word reading skills than instructional approaches that were less focused on these initial reading skills… across all grade levels, systematic phonics instruction improved the ability of good readers to spell. The Department for Education published a research paper on Year 1 phonics screening . Notes to editors In March 2011, the Department for Education commissioned the Centre for Education and Inclusion Research at Sheffield Hallam University to undertake a process evaluation of the Year 1 phonics screening check pilot. The evaluation comprised two school surveys, case studies, a parent / carer survey and monitoring visits. The report can be found in our Publications section . All materials that schools can buy with government funding have to meet DfE’s criteria for assuring high-quality phonics work. The catalogue of approved list of products and training provides schools with a range of products and training that they can choose with the confidence that they all meet the criteria considered essential for good phonics teaching. They will be able to buy whole systematic synthetic phonics programmes or resources to supplement their existing programmes, teachers’ resources, materials for pupils, and training for individual teachers or all the staff. They will also be able to buy materials which will help children who need additional support in reading to catch up. The schools white paper, ‘The Importance of Teaching’, published in November 2010, made a commitment to ensure there is support available to every school for the teaching of systematic synthetic phonics, as the best method for teaching reading, and to provide funding for high-quality training and classroom teaching resources for all schools with Key Stage 1 pupils.

/government/speeches/elizabeth-truss-speaks-about-childcare-reform,"Thank you, it’s a pleasure to be here - and thanks for the Family Childcare Trust for putting on today’s conference. I’ve just come from a visit to Ephraim nursery in Peckham. They’re a private nursery, with their premises actually inside the school building of a primary and secondary academy, and I was meeting their staff with Boris Johnson. It’s always impressive to see a funny, warm, charismatic professional in action - charming children and media alike, in a high-quality nursery. And it was good to have Boris there, too. Seriously, though, it’s good to have such a dedicated champion of early years in City Hall. He knows it’s really important - for making sure the next generation do really well, and also for helping working parents in the city. And one of the things that really impressed me this morning was the way the nursery works with parents. It’s open from 8 until 6. Sandra, its leader, told me about how they talk to each individual parent about their needs, and what sort of care is right for them. There’s one mum who wants to do a degree - so they’re working with her to offer funded places across 2 days, rather than in one block, to allow her to do her course. It’s a great example of catering to all age ranges at a single location, with everyone working together to give parents the flexibility they need. That’s the sort of childcare I want to talk about today. Flexibility and choice Because families where both parents work are now in the majority in the developed world. Here in England, a third of mothers stay at home and two-thirds go out to work. Fathers are increasingly involved in the upbringing of their children. We need to support all these families in the choices they make - making life simpler and more fulfilling. That’s why we’re introducing flexible parental leave, for example, so that they can decide how to manage their lives when they have a baby. Likewise - I want families to have a range of flexible options when it comes to childcare and schooling, to suit their family circumstances. We all know that even as the economy is picking up, childcare is a big item on tight family budgets. And it’s not just a question of costs: all too often, childcare is too inflexible. Whether it’s not being able to find a childminder, or a nursery in the right location with available places, or a school that offers after-hours care, we know that too many parents can’t get the mix of childcare that they need. We want a system that gives them real flexibility - that gives more choice to more parents. So what are we doing to achieve that? I want to focus on 3 big things today. First, we’re increasing the amount of childcare that’s available, and its flexibility - across schools, childminders, and nurseries. Second, we’re driving up quality. And finally, we’re helping parents with the cost of care. Increasing availability is crucial I believe increasing the amount and flexibility of childcare is the single most important thing we can do to help parents. That’s where the biggest difference is going to be made. It creates more types of childcare, for parents to get the choice of care that they want - whether it’s in schools, or nurseries, or childminding. And offering that choice - increasing supply - will help us get value for money, too. At the moment, we spend a lot - more than the OECD average - yet parents are paying some of the highest costs in Europe. When parents find their options limited, the real problem is that over-complex funding and unnecessary bureaucracy have stopped childcare providers growing and flourishing. So that’s what we’re reforming. Childminders Look at childminders, for example. They are popular, flexible, and local. Many parents prefer home-based care, especially for the youngest children. They also suit parents who work shifts. But the number of childminders almost halved over the past decade. Becoming a childminder meant a mass of paperwork. Funding rules meant it was hard for childminders to access government funding - just 1% of funded early years places were provided by childminders And there are also fewer young people entering the profession. So our solution is first, to level the playing field in funding for independent childminders. Since September, any good or outstanding childminder can automatically offer funded places for 2- to 4-year-olds. Fewer than 4,000 childminders were accessing funding. Now, 32,000 are now automatically eligible. We’re also creating new routes to becoming a childminder in the first place. We’ve had a number of roundtables at the department with childminders. And they tell me that setting up is a lot of work. Childminders have to register with Ofsted. They have to spend about £80 on a medical check. About £100 on a pre-registration course. Up to £100 for paediatric first aid training. Public liability, car and home insurance, professional membership, DBS checks, buying equipment, toys, books, creating a website, sorting marketing and accountancy. I could go on - but I think I would probably bore you. It’s a lot of money - we estimate at least £800 - and a lot of time. That’s one of the reasons we’ve enabled the creation of childminder agencies. By helping with that admin, agencies will simplify the process for becoming a childminder. They could spread the cost, reduce the hassle, and use economies of scale to make it cheaper. If existing childminders want to join an agency - and it’s completely optional - then they will benefit from that shared invoicing, marketing and training support too. And for parents, they’ll make it easier to find and employ a childminder - taking vouchers, and giving access to lots of childminders in their area. At the moment, 20 organisations across the country are working with us to trial childminder agencies. I know that some of them are here today. Some are private businesses, some are led by local authorities, one’s a children’s centre, some are school based, one’s a charity, one’s a joint venture between a business and a council. All of them are committed to seeing what works. And in time, we expect agencies to increase the numbers of childminders - France, where creches familiales have similar functions to agencies, has 5 times as many childminders per person than England. We want to see more childminders - both independent and agency, working with other types of provision - so that parents have flexibility and choice. Nurseries Nurseries are equally essential, giving a really important, valued service to parents, and making up about a quarter of all childcare. So parents need to get good use from them, too. We’ve simplified funding. Any good or outstanding nursery will be able to access money - just like childminders - without jumping through any further bureaucratic hoops - and we estimate about 80% of nurseries will automatically get funding. And we’re making it easier to expand. We want planning rules - a long, cumbersome process that’s a big frustration for many nurseries - to be much more straightforward too, so they can convert office and shops without requiring additional planning permission. And we’re replacing a patchwork of local quality and registration standards - with single, national quality and registration standards - so that expansion across more than one authority is easier. That frees up nurseries that want to grow. It means that local authorities can focus on encouraging the best providers to their area, and support the weakest providers. School nurseries There’s one final part of the puzzle here - schools. Schools nurseries are an under-appreciated part of childcare. Half of London places are provided in schools, and they make up fully one-third of the national childcare market - some 800,000 early years places. But the hours are sometimes inflexible. Most only do 9 to 3. That’s if parents are lucky. Just imagine if they did 8 to 6. That extra 4 hours a day - two-thirds more time - it would revolutionise parents’ options. We want to encourage that model. That’s why I was with Boris this morning, and I’m delighted that Wandsworth want to lead the way, and want to encourage their school nurseries to offer places from 8 to 6. Some are already showing this model works. Like Oakwood school in Eastbourne. They have a mixture of funded and fee-paying care - which in turn, makes local government funding go further. They now generate income from their nursery, and by clever timing of sessions, they’ve filled almost all their spaces. And there are others - like Parbold Douglas C of E Academy in Wigan, who have a nursery from age 2 up, and are open from 7:45 to 6. Or St John Vianney RC Primary School in Hartlepool - who run from 7:30 to 6:30. Many of you will have seen Sally Morgan arguing for school nurseries to start offering places at age 2. I agree with Sally. And we are helping 50 schools trial places for 2-year-olds, in on-site nurseries. Because as Sally said, by the time they start school, poorer children have already fallen the equivalent of 19 months behind their more affluent peers. I want to make it absolutely clear that these children aren’t sitting at desks studying trigonometry. I recently visited Oasis Academy Hadley, for example, which is offering 2-year-old places. They were painting their feet to make patterns on the floor, running up and down this enormous strip of paper. The point is they were engaging with their teachers and nursery nurses, and learning. That’s what I’m talking about - not mortarboards and blackboards, which is sometimes what people have in their minds. About 375 schools now offer funded nursery places for 2-year-olds - many of them for the first time - a welcome development. School-based childcare for the over 5s And of course it doesn’t stop at age 5. Schools are already trusted locations, and are obviously convenient for parents who only have to do one school run. But often, their facilities sit empty for hours each day. One man who saw the potential to change that was Jack Hatch. He’s headteacher of St Bede Academy, in Bolton. He saw there was a need for childcare in the area, and felt St Bede’s had a mission to help local families beyond the day-to-day running of the school. So they started providing childcare, from as early as 7am, up to 6pm, up to 52 weeks of the year, to 7 other local schools - as well as 3 full daycare nurseries. All of St Bede Services’ settings are rated good or outstanding. But that was in the face of red tape. If a school wanted to offer care before 8 or after 4, they had to bring in more staff. They had to meet different qualifications rules. They had to consult locally, get permission from the local authority - and meet different planning requirements. And they had to make anyone providing childcare elsewhere register separately at each site. We want to make it easier - and encourage school-based childcare. Over the summer we consulted on making it easier for schools to bring in other providers, without that unnecessary red tape. We’ve already made it much easier for schools to extend the school day - reducing the hours that parents need to cover - and want to do the same for their term dates, too. We want to align the rules for during and around the school day - so that it is a much simpler operation. So now, you don’t have to be a complete hero like Jack Hatch - this is something all headteachers can do, and ought to think about. The new rules will make it easier to bring in private or voluntary sector childcare providers on-site - buying in their specialist expertise. Or if schools want to, then it will be easier for them to provide the services themselves. So across schools, childminders and daycare nurseries, we’re expanding availability. The latest figures show the total number of primary schools, nurseries or childminders offering childcare rose from 88,000 in 2010 to 90,000 in in 2011. That’s 2 million early years places - a 5% increase on 2009. Children’s centres I want to talk briefly about children’s centres. They’re often mentioned in the childcare debate. Just to be clear, they provide 1% of all daycare places - compare that to school-based childcare, which is 30%, and it’s a much smaller number. They are an important part of the support we provide for children and families. But that support is primarily about pre-natal, post-natal care, parenting classes, stay and play, providing support and networks for those parents - I was part of my network, after I had my daughters. We have to be clear that they’re there for everybody in the local community. And in our guidance that we put out earlier this year, we made it very clear that local authorities have a responsibility to make sure children’s centres are accessible to all parents. Of course we want focus on disadvantaged families - but unless we get all parents through the door, how are we to know which are those that need most help? And I’m delighted to see a lot of children’s centres working much more closely with their local health services. I met children’s centre leaders in Watford recently, and it was great to see the range of services they provided - maternal support, antenatal classes, midwives on call - and more. So parents are getting a seamless service, from expecting a baby, through birth, right through early childhood. Because the wider purpose of children’s centres is to improve outcomes for children. And that’s what we want them to focus on. There’s this rumour that hundreds are closing. It’s not true. Figures from local authorities tell us about 1% of the total number have closed since 2010 - and a few have opened, too. And we know from 4Children that 1 million parents using them - so they are thriving. But I think we can go further. I want to see them even more integrated with health services - especially with health and wellbeing boards. And DCLG have announced a fund, which local authorities can bid for, to make sure services suit parents - so that parents can find all the services in one place, for example, by sharing sites - rather than having to travel from service to service. We all know how important that sort of local, accessible service is. I want to encourage everyone to apply - or get their local authority to apply - because it’s a great opportunity to make sure more money gets to the frontline and services work for parents. Improving quality Availability is a big issue for parents. So is quality. But the 2 are linked. By simplifying funding for good and outstanding providers, for example, we’re creating a race to the top. We’re funnelling money towards the best. That gives providers a good reason to get better. And clarifying the rules means providers are focused on children - not on meeting the demands of red tape. Take registration. At the moment, we have 2 registers, for different ages; each has different requirements; the older register is compulsory if you do more than 2 hours; but you can still register if you do less. That’s so complicated, in one of our policy papers we resorted to showing this using a Venn diagram. Or take inspection, where we have overlapping Ofsted and local authority rules. Or qualifications. We used to have 400 early years qualifications, a majority of which have no maths or English requirements. All of this duplication is confusing for parents, time-consuming for providers, and the purpose of these rules - ensuring quality - actually becomes harder when people focus on box ticking, rather than what matters: children. So we’re improving how it works. We’re improving registration - we’ve consulted on introducing a single, clear set of safeguarding and welfare requirements. We’re improving inspection - and want Ofsted to be sole arbiter of standards, with consistent quality standards. Local authorities can support weaker providers, using the issues identified by Ofsted - so the two work together. And we’re improving qualifications. The new, more rigorous early years educator qualification will be available from 2014. We’ve made 1,000 bursaries available for apprentices aspiring to a career in early years education. Just a fortnight ago, we announced these were increasing from £1,500 to £3,000 for the first 200 successful applicants. And I’m pleased to say that this September, we recruited more than 2,300 trainees to become early years teachers - a 25% increase - despite strengthening the entry requirements. All of this moves us towards a single training, regulation and quality system from 0 to 18, that’s clearer for parents, and puts better outcomes for children at the heart of reform. Helping with costs So that’s how we’re increasing availability and improving quality. Our third priority is to offer support for parents, to help with the costs of childcare. We already fund 15 hours of free childcare for every 3- and 4-year-old - worth £2,400 to each family. And we’ve made it much more flexible so parents can take it in blocks. And we’ve increased funding for low income 2-year-olds. Just one month after launching the scheme, 92,000 children have benefitted - we’ve already reached an estimated 70% of the deprived children we want to. On top of this basic entitlement, low income working families can get help for up to 70% of their additional childcare costs. And under tax-free childcare, those on middle incomes will get up to 20% of their additional costs paid. Our vision So there are 3 elements to our plan. We’re increasing the availability and flexibility of childcare - of every type. We’re improving quality - by clarifying standards. And we’re helping with costs. All of those things fit together. They create a much more coherent, less fragmented market. They aim to create a system where parents are in the driving seat, and children get what they need. Our vision is of childcare where families want it, at the time they need it, provided by people they trust, at a cost they can afford. I know that families are under pressure. I know they face tough choices about how to balance work and care - not least at Christmas time. I want it to be a real choice. So that each family - of any shape and size - can work out what’s best for them, and their children."

/government/news/new-school-direct-programme-for-early-years-initial-teacher-training,"School Direct (Early Years) places are available for training starting in September 2014. Successful completion of the programme will lead to the award of early years teacher status. Early years teacher status is the equivalent to qualified teacher status (QTS) as the entry requirements to early years teacher training are the same as for primary teacher training. Early years teachers specialise in early childhood development and are trained to teach across the early years foundation stage (from birth to 5 years old). They must also understand how early education links to education beyond age 5 and into key stages 1 and 2 in school. This new approach is based on the School Direct training programme which gives schools more influence over the way teachers are trained. School Direct (Early Years) creates more employer-led training, giving employers (schools and nurseries) the opportunity to recruit and select their own early years teacher trainees and engage in the design and delivery of early years ITT in partnership with accredited training providers. The programme enables schools and nurseries to: influence how early years teachers are trained recruit the trainees that best meet their and their partnership’s needs, with the expectation that trainees will go on to work with the group of schools and nurseries where they trained decide which accredited training provider to work with and influence the way in which the training is delivered To introduce this approach, 59 School Direct (Early Years) places are available for training starting in September 2014. These have been allocated to the nursery chain, Bright Horizons, and the following early years teaching schools: Bristol Early Years Teaching Consortium Etherley Lane Nursery School, Durham Everton Nursery School and Family Centre, Liverpool St Edmund’s Nursery School, Bradford Training is fully funded by NCTL through a grant of £7,000 available to all trainees. Bursaries are also available: £9,000 for graduates with a first class degree and £4,000 for graduates with a 2:1. If the approach is successful we will consider increasing the number of training places for 2015 to 2016 to enable more schools and nurseries to get involved."

/government/speeches/early-years-report-2015,"Introduction Good morning everyone and welcome to the launch of our second annual report dedicated to early years . As Chief Inspector, I am committed to using the power and influence of inspection to improve the lives of children and young people. That is why I consider children’s early years to be so crucial. If we get the early years right, we pave the way for a lifetime of achievement. If we get them wrong, we miss a unique opportunity to shape a child’s future. What is the quality of early years provision? I want to start by looking at the quality of early years provision. I am pleased to be reporting some good news. There can be no doubt that the overall quality of the early years sector is better now than at any point in Ofsted’s history. Across the country, 85% of early years registered providers (that is, nurseries, pre-schools and childminders) are good or outstanding. That is a dramatic 18 percentage point increase in five years. As a result, many more parents have a much better chance of finding a high quality provider in their area. The quality of early years provision is also rising in schools. At the start of the current academic year, Ofsted re-introduced a discrete judgement on the quality of early years in schools. In the last two terms, we found good or outstanding early years provision in 86% of the schools inspected. That is 13 percentage points higher than five years ago. These rising standards are now more evenly spread across different types of providers than in the past. Schools, nurseries, pre-schools and childminders now all have high levels of good or outstanding provision. I am particularly pleased to see the progress that childminders have made. Ofsted has played a key part in raising the bar by not registering childminders unless they have been trained on the Early Years Foundation Stage. This raising of standards has resulted in more children meeting the government’s standard of a ‘good level of development’ at the end of Reception. In 2013, 52% of children met the standard. Last year, that figure had risen to 60% - though clearly we would like to see this figure rise still further. Outcomes in primary schools at Key Stages 1 and 2 have risen - and risen quite markedly in recent years. It is very likely that the improvements in the quality of early years provision have contributed to this rising attainment. What has changed? So what is making this difference? Put simply, more and more early years professionals see teaching as a fundamental part of their role. While this may be simple, it is not uncontentious. I know that because last year I wrote to all early years inspectors about how they should approach inspection work. I used the word ‘teach’ to describe the practice we wanted to see. This provoked a very strong reaction from the sector. Indeed, I could show you a pile of irate letters that landed on my desk after that letter. However, things are changing. A year later, we have used the word ‘teach’ frequently for early years education as part of the new common inspection framework. And this has been received without any hue and cry. A far distant response from the one I saw last year. However, there are still some people who suggest that if children are taught they have fewer opportunities to play. That is a false distinction. As you know, children learn while they play. Our inspectors have gone to good and outstanding nurseries, childminders and schools and have seen adults using every opportunity, every interaction, to encourage children to learn. They were so subtle that the children remained completely absorbed in the moment. Every activity brought new opportunities to encourage children to reflect, to practise new words, to pay attention. Young children can learn without any loss of freedom, imagination or excitement. They can learn without sitting down, they can learn at their own pace and they can learn while doing the things they are most interested in. We know that this is happening because our inspectors have observed it. What about the disadvantaged? So the quality overall of early years education is better than it has ever been. But is it – and this is the key question - benefiting our poorest children as much as their peers? After all, it is the poorest children who have the most to gain if they are being well taught before they reach statutory school age – and the most to lose if they aren’t. Remember, all the research shows that the experiences in early life matter more than at any other stage in a child’s development. In my view, the most important measure of success for the early years sector is whether the poorest children are doing as well as their better-off peers by the time they start school. I am sure those of you in the room are now very familiar with the statistics but I will keep returning to them until they change. At the age of five, there is already a yawning gap in school readiness between the most advantaged and the poorest children. That is completely unacceptable. Last year when I spoke about this, I said that, in 2007, the gap between the poorest children and those from more advantaged backgrounds was around 20 percentage points. Six years later in 2013, the gap had not closed: it was still around 20 percentage points. Well, that was last year. And this year? I am sorry to say that the gap is still around 20 percentage points. What this means in practice is that the poorest children are less likely to be able to follow instructions, make themselves understood, manage their own basic hygiene or play well together. By age five, many children have started reading simple words, talking in sentences and adding single numbers. Far fewer of the poorest children can do these things. And as we know, a child’s attainment in the early years is a good predictor of how well they will do later in life. We have one chance to get this right. So what can be done? Let me be clear: what the poorest children need is to be taught, and well taught, from the age two. Last year I was very clear that schools have a fundamental role to play if we are to do better for our poorest children. I say it again, and I stand by it – schools are best placed to tackle disadvantage. Does this mean that early education elsewhere is substandard? Absolutely not. Does this mean that no one else can do well for the poorest children? Absolutely not – and there are those in this room today who are demonstrating the difference that the private, voluntary and independent sector can make when they focus on the poorest children. Children who are at risk of falling behind need particular help though, and it remains my view that schools are often best placed to deliver this. And let me tell you why. First and foremost, a growing proportion of primary schools have now succeeded in reducing the disparity between poorer children and their peers in reading and other core skills. Between the age of five at the end of Reception and the age of seven, there has been a narrowing of the gap. Even in the space of two years, a lot of primary schools have made a difference. If primary schools have demonstrated they can do this, then how much greater would be the impact if children joined the school not at aged four, but aged two? No, it is not proven. But it is obvious what has been done to date has not worked. It’s time to try something different. Why primary schools? Why might primary schools do better for the poorest? Moving to a new place of learning can be a point where children lose their way at any stage in their education. A smooth transition into Reception from nursery is particularly essential. We know that moving from a nursery or childminder, or indeed the home, into school can cause problems for poorer children. A child has to adjust to new children, new routines and a new environment. If the child is mature and resilient and the parents have used all their knowledge and resourcefulness to prepare them for this step, they will usually cruise into school. But a child who is already struggling, whose parents may have their own negative perceptions of school, may find it much more of a struggle to adjust. Schools that offer nursery class provision have an in-built advantage for such children – there is no transition. Once the child has settled, they can stay where they are when they reach statutory school age. Schools have another in-built advantage – they have more access to specialists. Of course, disadvantage is not the same as special educational needs. Too many schools make that mistake. But if a child does need specialist help at age two, three or four, a school should have the specialists on call who can step in. Speech and language therapy, behaviour management, parenting support: schools are more likely to have the right phone numbers pinned to the wall. Another advantage is that schools are familiar with tracking children’s development and have the systems to do this easily. Of course, other types of provider can track development. But we know this doesn’t always happen, and it is far easier to track from age two to 11 within one institution. I have said it before, but it is worth repeating. Well-qualified graduate teachers make a difference too. It makes a difference across all ages but particularly in the early years. Recent evidence from researchers at Oxford University for the Nuffield Foundation makes this clear. Does every two-year-old need a qualified teacher? No, some children do very well without. But a child whose development is not where it should be will need more adult intervention. They will need help to master new skills. They will need more gentle coaching with their speech. They will need frequent encouragement to maintain their focus and not lose concentration. Some children will need an adult alongside them almost all of the time if they are going to catch up. And it’s because adults are more important for the poorest children that higher qualifications make all the difference. Finally, as we set out in the thematic inspection report we are publishing today, the schools we visited had their very youngest children playing alongside slightly older children. Of course, two- and three-year-olds encounter older children in other kinds of early education settings. But the schools we saw had younger children and slightly older children together for longer during the day – and this helps children to develop. They mimic what they see: more mature behaviour and more sophisticated language in those groups. So put simply, we need to get more of the poorest children into primary schools earlier. The government is acting to address this. It has, for example, made it easier for schools to take two-year-olds. However, in the last year, that has only resulted in 1,000 – just 1,000 – additional two-year-olds in schools. This represents fewer than seven additional children in each local authority area and that is nowhere near enough. Even more importantly, where schools are taking two-year-olds, they are not the most disadvantaged. Forty per cent of two-year-olds in England are eligible for a funded place based mainly on family income. And yet only 9% of two-year-olds in schools are on a funded place. There are 40 local authorities where there are no eligible two-year-olds in any school. It seems that school nurseries have been colonised by the middle classes. And who can blame these parents? I’m sure they see the well qualified staff and the appeal of an easy transition to Reception and conclude that it’s a good option for their children. But the reality is that these better-off children don’t get any particular advantage from being in a school from the age of two – they would be just as well catered for from an educational perspective in a private nursery, a childminder or indeed at home. It’s the poorer children who stand to benefit the most from this type of environment at the earliest age. But this quite clearly is not happening. So we need more schools to take two-year-olds. And we need more two-year-olds in schools to be from the poorest families. What needs to change? What needs to change to make this happen? First, we need to incentivise schools to take more disadvantaged two-year-olds and work with early years providers in their local area. I am pleased that two of my recommendations from last year have been acted upon. Last year, I called on the government to give the poorest children an advantage in the admissions criteria for primary schools. The latest admissions code does exactly this. Schools can now prioritise the poorest children. I also called on the government to work with Ofsted to streamline inspection and regulation of schools that provide for this age range. The regulations have now been changed and, since May, schools are no longer required to register separately to take two-year-olds. It is early days so I will watch with interest to see if these changes make a difference. However, obstacles still remain. It will simply not be feasible or even desirable for some schools to take two-year-olds – they may not have the space or capacity to expand. For these schools, there is still a crucial role in improving readiness for school. They should be reaching out and working closely with feeder nurseries, pre-schools and childminders to make sure more children are ready for school. I have recently set out my plans for how Ofsted will recognise exceptional system leaders who are transforming the life chances of children beyond their own institutions. In the primary sector, we will be identifying those people - those leaders - who are demonstrating real leadership working ‘down’ with early years providers as well as ‘across’ with other schools. And of course there will be exceptional leaders in other parts of the early years sector. We will be thinking carefully about what that looks like and we will be interested to hear your views on this ‘exceptional leader’ status. If schools and feeder nurseries, pre-schools and childminders are collaborating to get better outcomes for the poorest children, they need to be able to share information about which children are not doing well enough. The new baseline, which is being phased in from September, would be a valuable tool for tracking this if it could disaggregate individual children. Unfortunately, as things stand, it won’t. A check that only considers the school, not the child, is in my view not enough. I hope the government will look again at this as these proposals are further developed. Now I want to come back to my starting point, which is this: what the poorest children need is to be taught, from the age of two. Funded places for two-year-olds are intended to address this. The scheme is currently not reaching anywhere near enough children. In 2014, there were 113,000 children – that’s 42% of those eligible – who could have had a funded place. But their parents did not take this up. This is over 300 million pounds worth of potential investment that is not reaching the children it was intended for. So l me be straight about this: of course it is the parents’ prerogative to keep their young child at home. But all the evidence is clear that, for poorer children, being in high quality education at a younger age may make all the difference to lifelong attainment. How do we do get that message across? It isn’t easy, but here are a couple of suggestions. We know there are a number of children centres that are successfully reaching these parents. Like Balmoral Children’s Centre in Morecambe, whose exceptional work we highlight in our report. This centre has been helping parents to develop their parenting and teaching skills, doing universal screening so any child who isn’t developing well is picked up quickly, and is reaching out to encourage parents to take up funded early education places for their children. Unfortunately, Balmoral is a rarity. Too many children’s centres have lost their way. Our inspections have found that a very high proportion of them are struggling to get any kind of useful information about the children in their area. Children’s centres that don’t know local families well enough won’t be able to encourage parents to get their two-year-olds into school. Certainly, local authorities can play a role here. Because of their responsibilities for children’s centres, they can do more to make sure children’s centres have the essential information they need to do this work. But what is really needed is someone – one person - who meets the parents of every child who is eligible for funded early education from two. Someone who will speak to them and make sure they know what their child needs and what they are entitled to. Someone – one person - who will be accountable for making sure that no-one slips through the net. Fortunately, there is someone who can do this. That person is the health visitor. Health visitors have already a particular responsibility to identify and support those families who need additional help. Promoting readiness for school is already part of their role – but it should be at its very heart. Health visitor numbers have risen dramatically. And, from September, they will be commissioned by local authorities. Furthermore, there is a mandatory check for every one-year-old that is a core part of what health visitors are expected to deliver. This is the ideal opportunity to make sure every parent whose child is eligible for a funded place knows about this and is being encouraged to start their child in early education, in a school wherever that’s possible. Health visitors will be aiming to meet every low-income parent with a one-year-old. With the right focus, they can make sure that every parent knows exactly what early education is for, why their child would benefit and the simple steps they need to take to get their place. And to anyone who says that the job of a health visitor is health, not education, I refer them to the research just published from the University of Colorado that shows that poor educational attainment can reduce life expectancy as much as smoking. I am encouraged by the work of Public Health England in this regard, who have been highlighting the links between educational attainment and life expectancy. And so I come back to the role of local authorities. They will be taking responsibility for health visitors from September. This is a real opportunity to focus health visitors on this clear task – getting children into school, getting children to take up their funded place. It is an opportunity for local authorities to demonstrate leadership in the early years. The local authority must make sure that every health visitor is armed with the knowledge and information about where the best provision is. It is essential that any existing barriers between health and educational professionals are removed. Conclusion It is entirely welcome that early education is as strong as it is. All the professionals who have made this possible should be congratulated. I am pleased that so many dedicated leaders and practitioners have joined us here today at this meeting. But if we are being honest, the sector has done better for the children who perhaps need it least. Early years has the potential to drive social mobility for a whole new generation. It is leaders who are galvanised by this ambition who will make the difference. I would like to close with a short video of a school leader who is doing exactly that. Thank you."
/government/speeches/tim-loughton-to-the-centre-for-excellence-and-outcomes-in-children-and-young-peoples-services,"Thank you, Sir Paul. And thank you Christine for inviting me to speak to you today. C4EO is doing some really interesting and important work, which complements a lot of thinking in Government Departments across Whitehall, particularly in these financially challenging times. So I think this is a very good opportunity to talk about that approach, what we can learn from each other, and how to put those lessons into practice. But first it might be useful to put the current situation in context, and say something about the challenges facing all of us in the coming months and years. [Outline of the financial situation - how we got here, need for financial restraint, etc.] Last week the Chancellor’s emergency budget set out the tough but fair measures that we need to take to tackle the country’s budget deficit and bring spending back under control, in I think a measured and realistic way. The scale of the fiscal challenge is huge, and that does mean there will be very real and unavoidable challenges - and the Department for Education is not immune from them. Many families will face the challenge of hardship. There will be a strain not just on resources, but on relationships too. As pressure on families increases, so too will the pressure on children. One child in five in this country is currently living in poverty, and two million children live in poor housing. And we know about the links between economic recession and the effects on mental health in the family and, increasingly, in children. As they look to us, and to you, for support in these difficult times, we have to ensure that our services offer them what they need in the best possible way. That’s why the coalition government has put the principles of freedom, fairness and responsibility at the heart of our decision-making and our policies. We have already announced that we will protect spending on schools, Sure Start and 16-19 funding, while also announcing the introduction of a pupil premium that will allow us to tackle educational inequality by ensuring that additional money is provided to those who teach the most disadvantaged children. And we will refocus Sure Start on meeting the needs of the most disadvantaged families. But there’s no doubt the landscape has changed, and when we’re thinking about how to provide public services in future - whether that’s childcare places, safeguarding vulnerable children, or school IT projects - we need to look first and foremost at quality outcomes as well as value for money, and do all we can to make sure that we get the maximum bang for our buck. That means looking at outcomes rather than, for example, throughput. Because in the past I would contend, too much of what passed for evaluation of any particular process or project was often not much more than a measurement of quantity - how many young people were signed up for this or that particular scheme, for instance - rather than a thoughtful analysis of what each individual may or may not have gained from the project. Did it have a life-changing impact for them? How did it improve their life chances? So we have to be smarter, we have to think about how children have actually benefited (or not) from our policies and investment; about the timeliness of interventions, and whether departments and agencies have done as much cross-cutting work as they can. In the coming years, all of our interventions must be targeted on the people who will benefit most, and provided in the way that will help them best. So I am really switched on to good practice. Where is it? And how do we learn from it? How do we discover the best models for public services in times like these? At the heart of the new government’s approach is a determination to move away from a top-down, prescriptive approach, and to devolve more power and freedom to parents and professionals. Parents have the primary responsibility for raising children, and our policies should always recognise that. But even the best parents need support from time to time. So we need to make sure they have access to the professionals - whether state-provided or from the voluntary sector - who are experts in their respective fields. They are the people we need to trust, and it’s their experience we need to share. Thousands of them are already doing excellent work, and formerly as an opposition front-bencher, and in the first month in my new job, I have visited some great examples of local schemes that are really making a difference. There are successful projects in every part of the country. In Kent, for example, an Early Talk programme has been set up in Ashford, at low cost, to help children with speech and language difficulties to develop their communications skills early on. It’s a multi-agency approach, and it has resulted in over 90 per cent of those children making good progress in a mainstream primary school when in the past they would have needed specialist language provision. Poor speech development is often at the heart of poor learning, and the earlier it is detected and dealt with, the better a child’s chance of keeping up both educationally and socially. And Kensington & Chelsea’s ‘Virtual School’, with its focus on attendance and attainment, is improving the educational outcomes of looked after children and young people in the borough, and making real reductions in the number who are not in education, employment or training (NEET). Or there’s Tower Hamlets’ ‘Parents as Partners in Early Learning’ scheme, where a system for sharing information between parents, teachers and others involved with the child’s learning has resulted in a significant increase in children’s communication and personal skills. So there’s plenty of good practice going on out there. But there’s no point having a brilliant idea and not telling anyone about it. That’s why C4EO’s work on improvement is so important. It allows local authorities to use the best evidence and research to improve local practice and drive up standards. Because knowledge is power - power to do good - but only if you share it. Travelling about the country, I have been struck by the number of times I’ve heard about a scheme or initiative that’s achieving excellent results in addressing a problem in one authority - but which is completely unheard of in the neighbouring area. We need to be smarter about using and disseminating good practice, and in future I see an important role for government in facilitating best practice. For instance, my ministerial colleague Sarah Teather and I are looking at organising an event that gets together local authority lead members and directors to look at best practice, and discuss what might be transferable from one area to another. It needs input from both local authority elected members and officers, and I’d be interested to hear your views on how we take that forward. It won’t be a case of funding all the good schemes we hear about. What we will be doing is helping appropriate voluntary sector organisations to become part of the solution, by making it easier for them to work with statutory agencies. Families The Government believes that families are the building blocks of society. We believe that in order to build strong communities, we need to nurture and support families of all kinds. That doesn’t mean we think it’s Government’s business to lecture families about how to live their lives. That can be counter-productive. What we need to do is provide them with an environment in which they can thrive. That is why we are setting up a new Childhood and Families Task Force, to look at areas like parental leave and flexible working, the support we give children in the event of family breakdown, and how to help children avoid the pressures forcing them to grow up too quickly. The Task Force will be chaired by the Prime Minister, and again Sarah Teather will be playing a crucial role as our departmental representative. In recent years, services that take a ‘whole family’ approach to helping families with multiple problems have grown rapidly, and here again there is a great deal of excellent local practice we can learn from. In Westminster, for example, the Westminster Family Recovery project is addressing the needs and behaviours of the families who place most demands on the local authority’s public services - as well as having a high impact on the communities around them. By working intensively over a period of around a year with these families, the project aims to bring about long term inter-generational changes in behaviour. It’s an approach that is already delivering good results: for example, 50 per cent of children in families who have been part of the project for six months or more have shown an improvement in their school attendance. From a financial and effectiveness perspective, it has to make sense to concentrate a holistic solution on those families whose problems are taking up a disproportionate amount of professional time and resources. And in Suffolk, agencies are also doing excellent work in identifying and working with their ‘high demand’ and ‘high cost’ families. They have also carried out some intensive work looking at the needs of Young Carers. They are another neglected army of dedicated volunteers, and I went to their annual get-together at Fairthorne Manor last weekend. Early intervention If we are serious about addressing the problems facing us, and doing it with scarcer resources, then it’s essential we adopt new ways, smarter ways, of thinking and working. But one very old way of working - the ‘stitch in time saves nine’ principle - can also stand us in good stead. Early Intervention is a key component of providing effective, and cost-effective, services. At just 22 months, a poor child’s skills already lag behind those of a child of the same age from a better-off home. That disadvantage - if it is not tackled - will remain throughout life, with huge implications for choice of career, the limiting of opportunity, and even reduced life expectancy. A child born into one of England’s poorest neighbourhoods today will die (if nothing changes) seven years before one born into the richest. The stitch in time approach saves lives - sometimes literally. It often saves money too. For instance, it’s been estimated that a reduction of just one per cent in the number of offences committed by children and young people has the potential to generate savings for households and individuals of around £45 million a year. That’s why projects such as Action 4 Children’s Intensive Fostering are so interesting, concentrating the expertise of highly trained and motivated foster carers on teenagers on the cusp of the youth justice system. I am well aware of C4EO’s invaluable work on Early Intervention and cost-effectiveness, and we will study it closely as part of the work that we are currently carrying out on cost-effectiveness within the department. Incidentally, it seems to me that Early Intervention provides another argument against the reform of public services being driven by central government. If the solution to a problem has to wait until someone in Whitehall makes a decision, the chance for getting in early and sorting out trouble at its root is likely to have passed. And to encourage further that local approach, and to drive home the cost-effectiveness message, we will be investigating ways in which we can ensure that providers are paid partly by the results they achieve. That seems only right. Disparity of local authority outcomes - why are some LAs so much more successful than others? I believe that it’s only by sharing knowledge and expertise that we will be able to tackle the scandalous disparity of local authority outcomes. Why are some local authorities, with no more resources and with similar populations, so much more successful than others at improving outcomes for young people? Nottingham, Leicester and Haringey are all in the top 20 most deprived local authorities, but have all seen improvements in reducing both youth crime and teenage pregnancy recently. These local authorities have seen falls of between 15.9 per cent and 21.5 per cent in the rate of teenage pregnancies, compared to the average decrease nationally of 0.2 per cent, where overall figures remain stubbornly high. They have also seen falls of between 18 per cent and 62 per cent in youth crime. Stoke-on-Trent - also in that top-20 most deprived category - managed to achieve a fall in its youth crime rate of over 70 per cent between 2006-7 and 2008-9. What can explain those statistics? And why aren’t those results being replicated across the country? In large part it must be because less-good authorities are failing to learn from the best. And in a strange way, there’s an encouraging message there. It means there are authorities out there doing really great work. It means we don’t have to reinvent the wheel. Using good practice developed in one area to help other areas improve their services is a cost-effective way of helping all children and families to achieve good outcomes. I’d like to give a plug here for the C4EO website. A good case study can be like gold dust, and C4EO’s rigorous process of validation means that the case studies on your website are a fantastic resource for others seeking to provide better services for their own communities, and great scope for peer mentoring between authorities, ADCs and LGAs. Conclusion All of us, whether in government or the voluntary sector, whether large organisations or individuals, need to work together to tackle the difficulties facing our country. That is what the Big Society is all about, and we shall be hearing a lot more about that. It’s all about empowering the sector, local communities and individuals to take the lead, to pool and share their expertise. And I believe that far from being helpless in the face of global processes, we actually have the solutions in our own hands. We have the resources in our local hospitals and schools and community groups to make this a better country. By identifying programmes and organisations that can actually deliver the results we want to see, and using an empirical approach rather than one that is ideologically driven, we can create a pattern for working more intelligently in future. In that spirit, over the summer we will be looking at how the Government can best support improvement in children’s services without stifling the very real innovation that’s at the heart of the best local authorities and their children’s services partners. I know C4EO and many of you here today will be monitoring our progress, and giving us the benefit of your experience. I look forward to working with you and hearing your views. Thank you."

/guidance/early-years-initial-teacher-training-a-guide-for-providers,"Overview This information is for early years initial teacher training ( ITT ) providers. If you’re interested in applying for early years ITT , visit the Get into Teaching website . Advice for employers can be found in the early years initial teacher training: a guide for employers . Early years ITT leads to the award of early years teacher status ( EYTS ). Training places Requesting places for the academic year 2017 to 2018 Request an allocation of places now using the [InlineAttachment:1]. Please read the [InlineAttachment:2] before requesting your places. If you’re an accredited ITT provider with a good or outstanding Ofsted rating, you’re already approved to provide the full range of ITT courses, which includes early years ITT . A list of early years initial teacher training providers and School Direct (Early Years) lead organisations with training places for September 2016 is available. Recruiting trainees Once we’ve confirmed your allocation of places, you can start recruiting candidates. Candidates will submit applications directly to you, and you will be responsible for managing this process. Becoming an accredited training provider To offer early years ITT , you must be accredited to run at least 1 programme leading to the award of qualified teacher status ( QTS ). You must not hold a grade 3 or 4 rating from Ofsted. Find out more about becoming an accredited provider and the accreditation withdrawal process: initial teacher training . Working in partnership to provide training If you’re not accredited to provide early years ITT training, you can work with an existing accredited provider. You must have a partnership agreement in place with your accredited provider which explains the roles and responsibilities of each partner. Training You’ll need to design your training programme to enable each of your trainees to meet the Teachers’ Standards (Early Years) ). They’re designed for high quality work with the birth to 5 years age range. This will include: the content they must cover how you structure and assess their performance Trainee teachers must be trained to teach across the early years foundation stage (from birth to 5 years old). They must also understand how early education links beyond age 5 and into key stages 1 and 2 in school. Your training programme will need to provide trainees with enough time in early years settings or schools to allow them to show they meet the standards. Assuming trainees are full time, this would mean: 160 days (32 weeks) for a 4 year undergraduate programme 120 days (24 weeks) for a 3 year undergraduate programme or graduate (university-based) route Placements should take place in at least 2 schools or early years settings and include at least 2 weeks in a school in key stage 1. A shorter training programme may be suitable for some trainees, but others may need longer to meet the required standards. For graduates on an employment-based route, the amount of time will be determined by their specific training programme. You shouldn’t recommend any trainee for the award of EYTS until they have met all the Teachers’ Standards (Early Years) . Training routes There are 4 routes that lead to the award of early years teacher status. Details of available funding, including bursary rates for the academic year 2016 to 2017 are in our early years initial teacher training ( ITT ): funding guidance . Graduate entry (full-time) We fund this route and training is typically over a 1 year period. Some trainees may be eligible for a bursary. This route also includes School Direct (Early Years). Schools and nurseries can work in partnership with accredited ITT providers. School Direct (Early Years) places are allocated to lead organisations (schools and nurseries). This delivery method enables lead organisations to: influence how early years teachers are trained recruit trainees that best meet their partnerships’ needs offer trainees work after completing their training within the group of schools/nurseries they trained in decide which accredited ITT provider to work with under a partnership agreement Find the School Direct (Early Years) lead organisations . Graduate employment based (part-time) This is for graduates working in an early years setting who require training and further experience to meet the requirements of the Teachers’ Standards (Early Years) . We provide funding for training costs and additional funding is also available to contribute towards employers’ costs. Undergraduate entry (full-time) This is for those who wish to undertake a level 6 degree in an early childhood related subject along with early years teacher training. It is typically a full time 3 or 4 year route for those entering the profession. Funding for course fees may be accessed by eligible trainees through tuition fee loans from Student Finance England (SFE) . Assessment only This is for graduates with experience of working with children from birth to 5 years old who can meet the requirements of the Teachers’ Standards (Early Years) without further training. An example of this is an early years teacher from overseas. Assessment typically takes place over 3 months. We don’t fund this route; it’s self-funded.

/government/news/disadvantaged-children-to-benefit-from-life-changing-money,"New government funding to help the most disadvantaged children receive high-quality early education has been implemented in 7 local authorities from this week. Over £1 million will be distributed between local authorities in Blackpool, Bristol, Cambridgeshire, North Yorkshire, Northamptonshire, Hackney and Stoke-on-Trent to implement the early years pupil premium ( EYPP ) in their areas. The money will be distributed to early years providers delivering the funded entitlement for 3- and 4-year-olds, who will receive up to £300 extra per year for each disadvantaged child who meets the eligibility criteria. The Department for Education will ask for feedback from the councils before the full £50 million EYPP is implemented throughout England in April 2015. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said: One of my top priorities in government is to build a fairer society where children from every background get the start in life that they deserve. This new funding from the early years pupil premium will allow schools and nurseries to give extra help to toddlers from the poorest families so they can develop and learn quickly and prevent them falling behind other children when they start school. Childcare Minister Sam Gyimah said: I’m delighted we are helping the most disadvantaged children get the best possible start in life. Good-quality early education should not be denied to anyone. Children who get it go on to do better at school and earn higher wages, so the early years pupil premium will be a life-changing injection of money. I would encourage any parent who meets the EYPP criteria to tell a local provider they are eligible. The provider will then alert the local authority to access the funding. Children will qualify if they are 3- or 4-years-old, are receiving government-funded early education and their parents receive benefits used to access eligibility for free school meals. A survey published in 2014 found that disadvantaged 3- and 4-year-olds are up to 7 percentage points less likely to participate in early education. In 2013, just 36% of pupils eligible for free school meals achieved a good level of development in the early years (under 5s) foundation stage compared with 55% of other pupils. The Department for Education will ask for feedback from the council before the full £50 million EYPP is implemented throughout England in April 2015. Last year’s Effective Pre-school Primary and Secondary Education ( EPPSE ) report ‘Influences on students’ development at age 16’ showed that quality of provision can have a major impact on a child’s school readiness. The benefits of pre-school have been found to be higher for pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds. Notes to editors The 7 local authority areas, and their early implementation grants are: Blackpool (£76,745) Bristol (£197,591) Cambridgeshire (£132,979) North Yorkshire (£100,567) Northamptonshire (£201,655) Hackney (191,543) Stoke-on-Trent (£137,198) The funding is based on the estimated number of eligible children. The total funding is £1,038,278. All registered early years providers that take children for the funded early education entitlement - including school nurseries and maintained nursery schools; private, voluntary and independent providers; and childminders - will be eligible to claim the EYPP for eligible 3- and 4-year-olds. Children will be eligible if they are 3- or 4-years-old and receiving government funded early education in any provider, and their parents are in receipt of one or more of the following benefits which are the benefits used to access eligibility for free school meals: Income Support Income-based Jobseekers Allowance Income-related Employment and Support Allowance Support under Part VI of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 the guaranteed element of State Pension Credit Universal Credit Child Tax Credit (provided you’re not also entitled to Working Tax Credit and have an annual gross income of no more than £16,190) Working Tax Credit run-on - paid for 4 weeks after you stop qualifying for Working Tax Credit Or if they have been: looked after by the local authority for at least 1 day have been adopted from care have left care through special guardianship children subject to a child arrangement order setting out with whom the child is to live (formerly known as residence orders) [Contact:997]"

/government/news/free-early-education-government-sets-out-which-2-year-olds-will-be-eligible,"Thousands of disadvantaged 2-year-olds, and those living in care, stand to benefit from an extra year of free early education, under government plans announced today. In October 2010, the Government announced, as part of the Fairness Premium, that it will extend the free entitlement of 15 hours per week - available to every three and four year old - to all disadvantaged two year olds. Plans, to be consulted on this autumn, will propose that the criteria for measuring disadvantage should match the criteria used to assess free school meals eligibility. The Government also wants local authorities to provide free early education for all two year olds who are looked after by the state. In total, approximately 140,000 two year olds each year will be able to benefit from an extra year of free early education from 2013. Children’s Minister Sarah Teather said: Early education and childcare is crucial to a child’s development, giving them the opportunity to learn, thrive and play. But far too many children, many from disadvantaged backgrounds, are starting primary school without the skills they need to do well. Evidence shows that attainment gaps can open up as early as 22 months and persist through school. If we are to tackle this attainment gap and reduce social inequalities, it’s vital we get children from the poorest backgrounds, including those in care, into high quality early education. Today’s announcement is a real step forward and will give the most disadvantaged children access to high quality early education at a younger age. Under the plans, £331m will be available to local authorities in 2013-14 to fund places for two year olds. The Government wants local authorities to consider giving places to other two year olds who may get particular benefit - especially children with special educational needs and disabilities. The most recent statistics show that fewer than half of all children who live in the most deprived areas achieve a good level of development at age five, compared with nearly 70 per cent of those living in the least deprived areas. Children who have access to high quality early education are more likely to start school ready and able to learn, with the skills they need to succeed. The Government will be consulting on these plans in the autumn. The Department welcomes views from early education professionals, local authorities and parents about what they think would be best for disadvantaged two year olds. Notes to editors Provisions to extend the free entitlement to disadvantaged two year olds are currently passing through the House of Lords in the Education Bill. It is planned that the new entitlement for disadvantaged two year olds will come into force from September 2013. Looked after children are those who, under the Children Act 1989 are voluntarily accommodated or under a care order. Local authorities are responsible for planning how to meet the care and education needs of the children they look after and decisions about early education places will be part of that planning. The Government will consult formally from October on changes to the Code of Practice for the free entitlement for three and four year olds, and on which children should benefit from the new entitlement for two year olds. The revised Code of Practice will come into force from September 2012. The most recent statistics on the Early Years Foundation Stage Profile (assessment at age five) are available on the statistics section of our website. [Contact:997]"

/government/news/nursery-food-new-guidelines,"Speaking at the Food For Life Programme conference today, Children’s Minister Sarah Teather said the Government is asking the School Food Trust to draw up new nutritional guidelines for nurseries and children’s centres. Responding to calls from childcare providers, parents and nutritional experts for clearer information, the voluntary guidelines are being brought in to help children develop healthy eating habits early on and fight obesity. Children’s Minister Sarah Teather said: Getting children to eat healthy food early on is vital. Quite rightly, parents don’t want their child being fed junk food - and nurseries play a key role in developing good eating habits. Many providers have been calling out for clearer information on what food to serve - so I’m glad that, with the School Food Trust, we will be able to develop advice on the best healthy and nutritious food for young children. It’s a great way of helping every child get the best start in life. Background: The action is set out in the remit letter for the School Food Trust , which is available on this page. The SFT will use its expertise in nutrition to draw up the new guidance, provide advice to nurseries and create a voluntary code of practice. The SFT will also monitor the take up of the new standards and how it impacts on children’s health and well being. In her review of the Early Years Foundation Stage, Dame Clare Tickell recommended that the Government act on the report from Advisory Panel for Food and Nutrition in the Early Years which showed both the benefits and demand for clear guidance.

/government/news/help-to-up-skill-childcare-staff-before-they-reach-the-frontline,"People looking to work in childcare will be given more help to reach the high levels needed to give children the best start in life, Childcare Minister Sam Gyimah announced today (1 July 2015). Childcare apprentices will have to show they have a good level of English and maths by the end of their training through the creation of an ‘exit standard’ of a grade C or above in GCSE English and maths. Today’s announcement builds on last week’s Ofsted early years statistics that showed settings offering the government’s free hours of childcare per week have never been rated better and the quality of staff has never been higher. As a result, 100,000 more pupils are on track to be reading more confidently compared to 2012. Childcare Minister Sam Gyimah said: All the evidence shows that the higher the quality of childcare, the higher the quality of a child’s learning and development. That’s why it’s imperative that childcare workers have crucial literacy and numeracy skills needed to give every child the best possible start in life. We’re totally committed to raising the bar and improving the care children receive in the early years so parents can have the strongest confidence in the people who are teaching our youngest children. However, unnecessary barriers shouldn’t stop skilled people joining the workforce, and it makes much more sense to have an exit standard rather than a barrier to entry. That’s why I’m pleased to say that we will offer people the chance to study their maths and English GCSEs alongside their childcare apprenticeship training. The news has been warmly welcomed by the childcare sector, who say that the move will encourage more apprentices to join the early years workforce. Sue Robb, Head of Early Years at 4Children, said: We welcome the government’s decision that apprentices can work for their childcare qualifications at the same time as studying for their GCSEs in maths and English. This will encourage more apprentices into childcare and early years. Neil King, from the London Early Years Foundation, said: It is essential that we have accessible routes for those apprentices who are on their way to achieving their grade C in maths and English; whilst ensuring we continue to raise the quality of provision for children across the sector through the early years educator ( EYE ) qualification. This decision further supports government policy which is predicated on a high quality early years workforce that is fit for the future. Staff with level 3 EYE qualifications can lead and manage settings delivering this care, so it is essential that they are suitably qualified and have an appropriate level of numeracy and literacy. A number of government-funded projects are available to help staff to improve core skills while they are training or employment. The apprenticeship trailblazer group made up of childcare employers has submitted a new apprenticeship standard to government for consideration including a GCSE on an exit requirement. If approved by the Department for Business Innovation and Skills, the new standard would come into effect on 1 August 2015. In order to raise the quality of early years learning, the Department for Education has improved early years’ qualifications by setting more robust criteria for them and encouraging more high-quality entrants to the profession, including graduates through early years initial teacher training routes. As a result, 87% of the workforce now have level 3 qualifications and 13% have degrees. Notes to editors 85% of children receiving the government’s offer of free childcare receive it in ‘good’ or ‘outstanding’ settings The apprenticeship trailblazer group is made up of childcare employers and has a remit to develop employer led apprenticeship standards on behalf of the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. The exit requirement for GCSE English and maths grade ‘C’ or above means the new standard is more closely aligned with the requirements of other apprenticeship programmes. The standard will not however accept functional skills as an alternative to GCSE . In addition to apprenticeship routes, there are also standalone childcare courses that provide a level 3 training route for those individuals that already hold GCSE English and maths. [Contact:997]"
/government/publications/local-authority-led-pilots-a-summary-of-early-learning-from-the-pilots,"This report is the first published output from the evaluation of Local Authority Led Pilots in 13 areas in Great Britain set up to inform Universal Credit ( UC ) design and roll-out and to support Local Authorities ( LAs ) in their planning for UC delivery. This report was written in May 2013, approximately 9 months after the project areas were announced but only 4-5 months after the projects went live. Evidence and learning has accrued from the preparatory phase of the projects but remains tentative at this stage. The local authority led pilots have been set up to inform UC design and roll-out and to support LAs in their planning for UC delivery. The pilots commenced in September 2012 (although most only started in January 2013) and will run through to December 2013. The evaluation is being conducted in-house (although some LAs have bid for external evaluation monies as part of their bid) and the primary focus of the pilot evaluation is to capture evidence from individual pilot activity to inform the delivery and design of UC . The report is concerned with highlighting the key learning since the pilots began early in 2013. In doing so, it draws on the evidence supplied by the pilots themselves, as this information has been provided by each of the LAs , findings and basic statistics presented in the summary cannot be independently verified by DWP analysts. The learning from the pilots is being actively shared within the UC Programme along with that from the Direct Payment Demonstration Projects ( DPDP ) and incorporated in the development of UC policy and operations, in particular to inform payment exceptions and personal budgeting support and the Local Support Services Framework ( LSSF ). The emerging learning from the evaluation will be available to local authorities, social housing providers and interested stakeholders via the Learning Network. This is a web-based community sponsored by DWP and DCLG working with Chartered Institute of Housing and Institute of Revenues Rating and Valuation freely sharing learning with LAs , social housing providers and stakeholders originally established for the DPDPs . We will continue to work with local authorities to draw lessons from the pilots in developing Universal Credit. Some important findings Digital inclusion Not all customer groups have access to the internet either with the right tools/equipment or internet access – some local authorities report around 50-60% access and LAs have tried various approaches to improving access but have found it difficult to encourage take up. Budgeting and financial management support Many social housing tenants are reported to have problems with debt and rent arrears which might compound possible problems with personal budgeting. LAs have tried a number of approaches to help people with financial support, but results are mixed. Work access LAs have set up work access support to encourage customers to focus on employment as a way of maximising income. In order to make work support services more attractive to customers local authorities have engaged in various activities and approaches, take up has been limited. Vulnerable groups and the triage process A number of LAs have designed effective triage processes to identify customer groups most likely to be affected by welfare reform and who need additional support services. Partnership development Some authorities report that existing partnership arrangements do not facilitate the effective joint delivery of local services. More work is needed to understand the core business and service delivery processes of each partnership agency. Setting up these partnerships takes time. Data sharing Local authorities report that data sharing amongst partners is a significant problem and the lack of shared data is limiting their ability to identify and target particular customer groups."

/government/news/number-of-childrens-centres-by-local-authority,"The following text is from a Parliamentary Question answered by Lord Hill: Over the last few weeks the Department has been working with local authorities to establish the number of Sure Start children’s centres in each of their areas.　 That work is now complete. Local authorities have confirmed that on 8 September 2011 there were 3507 children’s centres across the country. The Department published a statistical release in June 2010 that showed there were 3,631 children’s centres in April 2010. Local authorities have informed the Department that the net reduction of 124 children’s centres since April 2010 includes 6 closures with the remainder of the reduction being accounted for by local reorganisations such as the merger of two or more centres. This includes cases such as when a local authority has merged the management teams of previously separate centres but kept their premises open on separate sites. A breakdown of this information is attached. This information is a snapshot of the position on 8 September only. Numbers will continue to change as local authorities make decisions about how to configure services to make best use of available resources and fulfil their duties to children and families. For example, this month Hillingdon opened a new children’s centre. Local authorities have a duty under the Childcare Act 2006 to ensure that there are sufficient children’s centres to meet local need and must consult before making any significant changes including closing any centre. The Government is committed to Sure Start and has provided enough funding in the Early Intervention Grant to maintain a network of children’s centres across the country. Children’s centres provide important support to children and families, particularly the most vulnerable. They are part of a coherent framework of foundation years services the Government is putting in place for families from pregnancy through to age five which includes the expansion of the Health Visiting service, a new free entitlement to 15 hours early education for disadvantaged two year olds and reforms to the free entitlement for 3- and 4-year-olds by 2013. Local authorities are asked to complete a database maintained by the Department called Sure Start On. Information from this database is made available to parents on the Directgov website. The Directgov website contains the name, address and contact details for every children’s centre in the country and can be viewed either by distance from a specific post code or address, or by local authority. On 18 July 2011 the Minister for Children and Families wrote to all local authorities reminding them of the importance of keeping this database up to date. It is for local authorities to determine the most effective arrangements in their areas. The Department’s discussions over recent weeks have revealed that many are making sensible changes in order to ensure greater efficiency through reorganisations including mergers of two or more centres and the clustering of several centres under one management team. For example, in Greenwich the local authority has adopted a model of federations for its children’s centres and has 17 lead centres with 11 managers. In Cheshire East the local authority has merged six centres as part of a general restructure of early intervention services. In Lambeth Clapham Manor and Triangle children’s centres have recently merged and now have one manager overseeing and co-ordinating services across two sites. This means that families have access to a wide range of activities across the two centres. In Cornwall, following consultation, the Council reorganised its children’s centres provision, from 1 September 2011, by federating 40 children’s centres to 18 lead centres. This has not led to the closure of any children’s centre buildings which have been retained as service access points. It is the outcomes that these services achieve, particularly for the most vulnerable, which are most important. The Government has emphasised this through the new core purpose of children’s centres and are developing arrangements to pay centres and local authorities by the results they achieve. [Contact:997]"

/government/speeches/nicky-morgan-discusses-the-future-of-education-in-england,"Good morning, and thank you Sir Anthony [Seldon, Master of Wellington College] for that very kind introduction. It’s a pleasure to speak here at Wellington College - a school that’s gone from strength to strength over the last decade under your careful stewardship. I’m sure staff and pupils, past and present, will look back on your time here with great fondness. Certainly the ministerial team at the Department for Education have benefited from your wise and thoughtful advice, and long may that continue. Today, of course, is the bicentenary of the Battle of Waterloo, marking the defeat of Napoleon and his army by the seventh coalition, with British troops being led by Arthur Wellesley, first Duke of Wellington, in whose honour this school is named. A defining chapter in our history and a moment that helped make our nation great. A moment that showed British grit in the face of adversity. And our ability to stick it out, bounce back, keep calm and carry on. Shared values that bind us together as one nation. When I think of those shared values, those shared experiences that make us proud to be British, I think of something I believe all of us here hold dear: our conviction that equality of opportunity is the cornerstone of a modern and enlightened society. Education is at the heart of our governing philosophy And education is the greatest way to level the playing field and give every child the chance to be all that they can be, and to reach their full potential. This government has committed to deliver real social justice and in no arena more than education do we have such potential to realise it. A good education is the key to the good life. A meaningful job. A sense of community and belonging. The skills to embrace the change and challenges of modern life in an increasingly global world. Our plan So I am proud of our drive over the past 5 years - our drive to ensure that every child is given the tools they need to develop and learn. From phonics and times tables at primary schools, all the way through to new gold standard qualifications at 16 and 18, we need to ensure that young people master the basics in primary and develop that deep understanding in secondary. Because if our focus shifts, and if we lose sight of the fundamental knowledge and skills that form the heart of a rigorous curriculum, the people that lose out are the most disadvantaged. It’s those children for whom a good education matters most - children growing up in families where their parents and carers haven’t had the same opportunities so many of us enjoy. These young people are the people we cheat when we somehow pretend a core education doesn’t matter. That false equivalents do the job just as well. Which is why I announced earlier this week that every child starting in year 7 in September will be expected to study core academic subjects that make up the EBacc right up to GCSE . Because one of my guiding principles - and I’m sure yours, too - is that every child, no matter their family circumstances, no matter where they’re from or what their background is, can succeed if we give them the tools that allow them to achieve that success. A rigorous academic curriculum must be central to that. Creating the conditions for success And if we’re to have high expectations for every child, we have to create the right conditions for those high expectations, where a love for learning can flourish. And we know that children need certain character traits to excel academically. The kind of traits that should be embedded through a whole-school approach to character education , helping children and young people become decent, happy, well-balanced citizens. I’m talking about exactly the kind of education that Anthony has championed for so long - I’m grateful for your research and support. And, as you say, Anthony, academic attainment and exam success are just part of the story. Building a strong character and a sense of moral purpose is part of the responsibility we have towards our children, our society and our nation. Because if our schools don’t nurture and develop these key traits, we run the risk of creating a generation who excel at passing exams, writing essays, absorbing information, but children without the skills they need to tackle the challenges that lie ahead and participate in society as active citizens, to make the right decisions and build their own moral framework. I want to help our education system to nurture a generation that has the pioneering spirit and determination that’s marked us out as a nation throughout history. So as our academic reforms start to take root and restore our qualifications and examinations system to the gold standard it is supposed to enjoy, we have the perfect opportunity to look at the curriculum. Things like: the character traits Doug Lemov wants to see all teachers foster in their classrooms - the skills that will help children remain on the right track as they embark on the next stage of their educational journey I want us to avoid the situation that was seen in the early stages of the American charter school system - highly motivated pupils, excellent results, but none of the skills needed to study independently and complete a degree the growth mindset, the ability to deal with set-backs, and the willingness to practice that Matthew Syed argues is essential to success Excellence If I can sum up my ambition for the next 5 years it would be spreading the excellence in schools we’ve unlocked over the last 5 years everywhere across the country. Our reforms have seen the unleashing of some truly excellent practice. We’ve built on Andrew Adonis’s fledgling academies programme to create a network of self-governing schools around the country - setting their own direction and giving parents choice. Free schools like ARK Conway Academy, providing an outstanding and innovative education to some of the country’s most disadvantaged children. Or School 21, which I had the pleasure of visiting recently, with its continuous focus on character and integrity - attributes embedded into every aspect of school life. Schools like these are the modern engines of social justice. But - to be abundantly clear here - it’s not the fact of being a free school or an academy that leads to this excellence. Rather, it’s what being an academy or a free school stands for. Freeing up schools and governors to make decisions that are right for their pupils. Greater competition and collaboration in the system. Encouraging local schools to learn from each other, share best practice and even partake in a bit of healthy rivalry! The innovative approaches that come when you give teachers and school leaders freedom beyond the red tape and bureaucracy. However, we have to acknowledge that excellence in the system is all too often confined to urban areas. Pockets of under-performance persist in coastal and rural areas, and even in some of our leafy suburbs schools who have the capability to be really excellent are coasting along at ‘just good enough’. I know that changes take time to embed, that improvements don’t happen all at once. But consistent improvement and spreading excellence is what the next 5 years has to be about. And that’s what the Education and Adoption Bill , which will receive its second reading next week focuses on. The question I have asked myself, and the question I will continue to ask, is how I, as Secretary of State, can help to spread excellence throughout the school system, from the early years right through to sixth from, across the whole country? How can we ensure that by 2020 there aren’t just 1 million more pupils in ‘good’ or ‘outstanding’ schools? How do we ensure we repeat this success? We’re at a new record high on the number of these ‘good’ or ‘outstanding’ schools, but this shouldn’t stop us going even further. And the reason I’m asking myself that is because a consistently excellent education system has to be at the heart of our commitment to govern as one nation. Not just levelling I’ve mentioned our aspirations for disadvantaged pupils, our conviction that central to social justice is closing the attainment gap that still persists. But I want to do that by raising standards for everyone. Not working to the lowest common denominator. I don’t want bright and driven kids from disadvantaged backgrounds to be content with average grades and average opportunities, simply because the gap has closed. I want a pupil premium that stretches them to the fullest degree. That’s why the historic focus on in-school gaps in attainment can’t be our only focus - instead we should be ambitious for all. Of course, it’s right to expect that schools should be supporting all pupils to achieve a floor standard, but we can’t afford to settle for the minimum. Because true social justice means enabling the very brightest to jump from Bs to As, just as it does getting others from Ds to Cs. Stability I want to finish on a note of reassurance. I don’t want anyone to mistake stability for silence, to presume that education is no longer a priority for the government. Education is a core part of this government’s agenda for this Parliament. The fact of the matter is that we now have to work with heads and teachers to make a reality of our new curriculum and qualifications. The dust must settle; we must give schools the chance to seize the opportunities our reforms offer. But, at the same time, I’m clear that the best schools should be able to extend their reach, to help more schools, more teachers and more pupils. To borrow unashamedly from ASCL ’s blueprint for a self-improving school system , I want to use my time as Education Secretary to give schools and the profession the skills and capacity to improve, but I want each and every one of you to take responsibility for that improvement. I want to unleash greatness in the system. It’s for all of us to ask the question: if it’s possible for this headteacher, this school, this area to achieve that greatness, why would anyone else settle for less? Thank you."
/government/speeches/speech-at-the-future-of-education-inspection-launch,"Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to the first in a series of events we are holding across the country to share more details of the important changes to inspection that will come into effect in September. First of all, can I apologise if my voice occasionally breaks. Surgery a few months ago has slightly diminished my lung capacity. I want to start this important conference by paying tribute to you as the leaders of our education system – people who are making such a difference to the lives of children and young people across our country. This is not a clichéd bit of idle flattery at the start of my speech but a deeply held belief that great leadership is leading the transformation in standards few would have thought possible only a short time ago - and certainly before the start of the Ofsted era 22 years ago. This transformation needs to be proclaimed much more loudly and much more confidently. The facts speak for themselves: a million more children in good or outstanding schools a larger percentage of schools moving to good from Requires Improvement and Special Measures than ever before more schools remaining good and not declining more youngsters reading by the age of 7 with record numbers reaching the required levels of reading, writing and mathematics at the end of Key Stage 2 outcomes at KS4, despite the odd blip, continuing to improve with more youngsters pursuing the tougher subjects at GCSE many more young people from poor backgrounds going to university than ever before and a much greater focus in schools on closing the attainment gap significant improvements in early years, including for the poorest children I think it’s also worth making the point that although many of our international competitors are doing significantly better than us in the OECD tables, England’s performance in relation to the other UK countries is good. We are ahead of Wales and Northern Ireland and I know there is deep concern in Scotland over rapidly declining basic skills, particularly for poor youngsters. Of course, there is much more to do. Regional variation in performance is still unacceptably wide and we are a long way behind the OECD top educational performers, particularly in South East Asia. But the trajectory of improvement is clear and is deserving of celebration, and not the corrosive negativity that we sometimes see and hear. Good leadership has brought about these improvements. That is why Her Majesty’s Inspectors will focus on leadership above all else when they visit good schools and colleges during the new short inspections. Their principal task will be to determine whether the leadership team, including governors, has the capacity not only to maintain existing standards but to improve them further. So, what sort of questions will HMI ask? Well, they are ones you would expect. Have the leaders got a grip on the institution? Do they fully understand its strengths and weaknesses? Have they communicated their strategy for raising standards to the key stakeholders? Are they focussed on what really benefits children and young people, rather than wasting their time endlessly preparing for an Ofsted inspection which could be years away? Do they refuse to accept excuses for underachievement and are they prepared to go the extra mile to compensate for family background? Are they simply presiders over the status quo, content to take the path of least resistance or are they prepared to challenge staff and students to do better? Have they built, or are they developing, a culture that is calm, orderly and aspirational? Are they, for example, people who tolerate scrappy worksheets? Or are they people who insist that children should have good materials to work with, including textbooks, readers and library books which they can use for classwork and homework? I make this last point because HMI increasingly report to me, and I’ve seen it for myself, that too many schools, particularly secondary schools, have conceded defeat on this issue. As a senior leader in a secondary school said to an HMI recently, ‘we don’t allow our children to take books home because they won’t bring them back the following day’. What on earth does that tell us about the culture in that particular institution? What on earth does it tell us about leaders who are not prepared to fight the good fight on this basic issue? How on earth will we ever begin to address the shocking underachievement of bright youngsters from disadvantaged homes, if we carry on patronising the poor and serving them up with lower expectations? The latest data from the Sutton Trust should alarm us all. Over a third of ‘highly able’ boys eligible for free school meals in England fail to achieve a good set of GCSEs despite having thrived at primary school, and the situation for bright girls from disadvantaged backgrounds is not much better. This is one of the reasons why Ofsted was so concerned about secondary school performance in my last annual report. We must really get this one right and ensure that the huge advances made at Key Stage 2, particularly for the most able, are consolidated at Key Stage 3, particularly in Year 7. So, we need great leaders in our education system from the early years upwards. Indeed, we need more mavericks, not fewer. And I take exception to the suggestion that somehow Ofsted constrains those leaders who want to do things differently. Far from it. There was no one more maverick than me when I led a school. But doing things differently was for one purpose and one purpose alone - to raise standards for the children in my school. There is no point in being an ‘off-the-wall’ leader if it does not serve the interests of children. I saw plenty of maverick leaders in my early days as a teacher in the Inner London Education Authority – heads of so called ‘flagship schools’ interested more in their own reputation than doing good things for the children in their institution. Greater autonomy and greater devolution of powers to schools, governors and leaders have provided opportunities as never before. Indeed, when people look back at this moment in the history of English education, they will see this as the age of the great educator – people who are making as much of a mark on society as the great inventors and scientists of the industrial revolution. Those involved in our own 21st century education revolution should be equally honoured and have monuments and statues built to them in towns, cities and market squares across the country. These are the modern heroes – people who have the courage to not only improve the prospects of children in their own schools but to also transform the life chances of youngsters in underperforming institutions elsewhere, especially in the most challenging areas. I am determined that Ofsted will recognise these system leaders. Therefore, from September when inspectors identify a leader who has played a key role in turning around other institutions Ofsted will send a letter to that early years leader, head teacher or college principal to inform them that their leadership has been acknowledged as exceptional. A copy of this letter will go to the Secretary of State and Ofsted’s Annual Report will also feature those leaders who have been recognised in this way. Of course, we need to work out the details of this proposal between now and September. Nevertheless, the principle is an important one. Those who are taking risks, putting themselves out and disseminating good practice beyond their own institutions need to be celebrated as exceptional reformers. Ofsted will always empathise with those heads who are doing their best. For example, we will always support the head of a Requires Improvement (RI) school who is moving the school forward and affirm that support by letter. Indeed, in my time as Chief Inspector I have written hundreds of such letters to head teachers whose schools are not yet good but where their leadership is making a significant difference and, within reason, we will always be flexible on the timescales for the re-inspections of RI schools where a new headteacher has recently been appointed to improve standards. Nine out of 10 senior leaders of schools judged to require improvement say that Ofsted’s inspections have helped them improve their institution – and in the majority of instances secure a good or outstanding grade on re-inspection. Many of the leaders I’ve just been describing are with us today. Leaders like Kevin Prunty and Peter Stumpf who have transformed Berkeley Primary School from a RI school to an outstanding one and Bella Street, an associate head who has done the same for Ashburnham Community School. Then there is Bob Ellis, who has led Deptford Green School out of special measures and has been recognised for his effective leadership as the school continues its upward journey. From the early years we have Mark Coles from Curzon Crescent Nursery School and Karen Ashton from Muriel Green Nursery School, who have both led their previously struggling settings to good. And from the FE sector there is Mohamed Ramzen, principal at John Ruskin College in Croydon who has been instrumental in taking the institution from inadequate all the way to outstanding and fundamentally changing the curriculum on the way. I know there are many other great leaders here today equally deserving of praise and only time prevents me from naming all of you. If Ofsted is going to support the reforming leader, then we as an inspectorate have also got to demonstrate that we are capable of change and reform in order to keep pace with higher national expectations. I fully accept this but reject some of the nonsense that I have seen about Ofsted’s capacity to reform. I would urge the people who make these criticisms to open their eyes and ears – we’ve done nothing but reform over the last 22 years and especially over the last 3. And if you don’t believe me, look at the inspection frameworks and guidance documents in 1992 and compare them to now. Look at the recent and most radical changes we have made to inspections across the different remits. For example: We don’t tell teachers how to teach anymore – there is no Ofsted preferred style of teaching. Our classroom observations are used for only two reasons (1) to check the school’s own assessment of the quality of teaching and (2) to identify the strengths and weaknesses of teaching across the school. Inspectors no longer grade the quality of teaching in individual lessons and no longer require teachers to produce lesson plans. It should be quite obvious whether the lesson had been planned or not. Inspectors do not require lengthy policy documents. They simply want to see whether the school has a concise and accurate evaluation of its own performance. Reports are now much simpler, clearer and more readable for parents and families. Ofsted has significantly increased the number of serving practitioners from good and outstanding institutions into the inspection workforce. From September, 7 out of 10 Ofsted Inspectors will be serving practitioners. Indeed, I hope by the end of my tenure 100% of all inspection teams will contain a serving leader. Lay inspectors with no experience of the classroom have been removed from inspection teams. Lastly, and most importantly, we have ended the outsourcing contracts and are bringing all schools and FE inspection in-house to provide much greater quality assurance to the inspection process. So, Ofsted has reformed, is reforming and will continue to reform. We will always do our best to adapt to a changing educational landscape. Let me give you two further important changes we’re making. Firstly, today we are launching a common inspection framework . This will encompass registered early years settings, maintained schools, academies, non-association independent schools and further education and skills providers so that common judgements and common terminology can be used across all these sectors. A young person, parent or employer should be able to pick up any of Ofsted’s inspection reports and be able to understand them quickly because the format and judgements are the same. Secondly, I intend to set up a high-level scrutiny committee in each of Ofsted’s regions, made up of HMI and senior education practitioners not involved in carrying out inspections for Ofsted. They will assess and rule on the internal reviews of complaints about inspection. Their decision will be binding on Ofsted. What we won’t change, however, is the rigour of our inspections and our determination to shine a spotlight on underperformance. As Chief Inspector, I will continue to tell it how it is, no matter how many brick bats are thrown at Ofsted and towards me. And because I’ve done that we are seeing progress being made in previously poor performing places like Norfolk, Middlesbrough, Bristol, Wakefield and Barking and Dagenham. So, let me now give you a bit more detail on the short inspections – detail which will be expanded on in the remit sessions. Short inspections As you all know, we are introducing these new-style inspections for schools and colleges that were judged good at their last inspection. We have been piloting the new approach in dozens of schools for the past three terms. Make no mistake, this is a very different inspection model to what has gone before – as you will find out shortly in your break-out sessions. The starting assumption of Her Majesty’s Inspectors will be that the school or college remains good. This should engender an atmosphere in which honest, challenging, professional dialogue can take place. Leaders will have nothing to fear from accurately identifying at the outset any weaknesses in provision and I urge leaders to be honest in the self-evaluation of their institution. HMI will be looking to see that the leadership has a clear understanding of the key areas for development - and a credible and effective plan for how to address these issues. This opening conversation should set the tone for the rest of the inspection. The purpose of the day that follows will be to validate the leader’s own assessment and to test it against data, observation and discussion with staff and students. The mantra of inspectors will be “show me what you’ve just said”. Inspectors will share their emerging findings with the leaders. They will give clear signals about whether things are going well or not. There should be no surprises at the end of the short inspection. As I said right at the start, the principal judgement that inspectors will make on a short inspection is the quality of leadership. Although HMI might conclude that particular areas of the organisation and curriculum are weaker than they were before, they will give credit if effective leadership is moving the institution forward. HMI will report their findings in a concise letter to the head or principal in a language that learners, parents and employers can understand. It will confirm that the provider remains good, explain what inspectors saw, and set out specific areas for future improvement. Much of the letter will be given over to how leadership across the school or institution is maintaining standards and building capacity for further improvements. So, short inspections will reduce the burden of inspection without losing the rigour that parents and the public rightly expect from Ofsted. It won’t be such a cliff-edge experience. In a small proportion of cases, inspectors will form the view that they have not seen enough evidence during the day to convince them that the provision remains good. In that situation, they will convert the short inspection into a full section 5 and call in a full, comprehensive inspection team to support them. The same conversion will apply if inspectors feel that there is sufficient evidence to suggest that the school or college may now deserve an outstanding judgement. In either instance, a decision to convert does not mean the outcome of the full inspection is pre-determined. The overall effectiveness judgement may go up or down but equally, the full inspection may confirm that the provider does indeed remain good. Conclusion By making these changes, I am confident that Ofsted will be able to have an even greater impact on standards and on the prospects of millions of children and learners who rely on the services we inspect and regulate. I’d like to end by thanking you again for coming today and to pay tribute for all the great work you do. Each and every one of you should be proud of what you’ve achieved in improving the life chances of the generation of young people who have passed through your care these last few years."

/government/news/press-briefing-morning-17-may-2013,"Gay marriage Asked whether Phillip Hammond was speaking for government in the views he had expressed on gay marriage, the Prime Minister’s Spokesman (PMS) said that there was a free vote on this issue, that would enable individual MPs to set out their positions and vote accordingly. The Prime Minister’s position is that he is a big believer in marriage, and that is why he thinks that gay people should be able to get married as well. Nigel Farrage Asked about the critical reception that Nigel Farrage received during a visit to Scotland yesterday, the PMS said that the Prime Minister had not expressed a particular view on what had happened to him, but that active political debate took place in the UK on a range of issues. Sri Lanka Asked whether Sri Lanka should be invited to a Commonwealth event commemorating the First World War next year, the PMS said that the usual approach on inviting members of the Commonwealth should be followed. Cost of politics Asked how the creation of 30 new Peers would assist the Prime Minister in delivering on his commitment to reduce the cost of politics, the PMS said that he wouldn’t speculate on new appointments, but that there was clear evidence of the Prime Minister’s commitment to this matter from the approach that had been taken on ministerial salaries, which have been cut by 5% and frozen across the period of this Parliament. Europe Asked what the Prime Minister would say to views expressed by Francois Hollande on his position on Europe, the PMS said that there was a debate ongoing in Europe about its future, and that changes needed to be made. The Prime Minister’s view was that Europe should become more competitive and flexible. Childcare Asked about the Prime Minister’s approach on childcare, the PMS said that there had been a consultation on the issue, that government was considering the responses, and would set out a way forward on this in due course. Spending Review Asked about the level of spending cuts that had been achieved by departments so far, ahead of the Spending Review, the PMS said that government would set out its budget for 2015 to 2016 on 26 June, and that the normal Spending Review process would be followed."
/government/news/professor-nutbrowns-interim-report-on-early-education-and-childcare-qualifications,"Professor Nutbrown is considering how to strengthen qualifications and career pathways for people working in early education and childcare. During a public consultation people raised concerns about the quality of tuition, the standard of qualifications, recruitment and retention, and career progression. Professor Nutbrown is considering the following issues as she develops her recommendations for government: An effective qualifications structure that motivates people working in the early years and tells employers what skills and knowledge they have. Courses that prepare people for working in the early years, raise the standards of those choosing to enter the profession, give them the right skills in literacy and numeracy and include the latest cutting edge detail about child development. The case for expanding the role of teachers in the early years, creating new teaching pathways with an early years specialism, linking more closely the education worlds of the school and the early years. Professor Cathy Nutbrown said: Getting qualifications right will help to ensure that women and men enter the profession with the skills and experiences they need to do the best work with young children and their families. Well taught courses and learning routes which lead to reliable qualifications can help early years practitioners to improve their skills, knowledge and personal qualities, constantly developing in their roles. This can only benefit young children, both in terms of their day to day experiences in the Early Years Foundation Stage and future learning outcomes. My interim report sets out the shared concerns among the workforce about their qualifications system, but I also hope it reflects the pride they take in their work and the hugely positive impacts they are having on the lives of our young children. Children’s Minister Sarah Teather said I welcome Professor Nutbrown’s interim report. It recognises the passion and professionalism of those working with our youngest children. We know the earliest years of a child’s life are so important to their development so it’s vital we have a workforce with the right knowledge and skills. I look forward to receiving Professor Nutbrown’s recommendations in the summer. Notes: 1. The interim report on early education and childcare qualifications is published on the Nutbrown Review website along with the report from the call for evidence, which is also made public today. Children’s Minister Sarah Teather asked Cathy Nutbrown, Professor of Early Education at the University of Sheffield, to conduct an independent review on early education and childcare qualifications in October 2011. To support her in developing her final recommendations, Professor Nutbrown today welcomes an additional four members to her Expert Panel: Stuart Turner (National Childminding Association) Purnima Tanuku (National Day Nurseries Association) Sharon Curtis (Ellesmere Children’s Centre, Sheffield) Fiona Pethick (Ofqual). The final report of the Nutbrown Review is expected in the summer. To gather the views of the sector, Professor Nutbrown conducted a public call for evidence, which included: 982 written responses to a public consultation. Five regional consultation events - in Birmingham, Leeds, Bristol and two in London (around 40 attendees each) A larger consultation event for stakeholders in Solihull (around 120 attendees). An online survey of parents run by Netmums, to which 1,031 responses were submitted. [Contact:997]"
/government/publications/investigating-the-role-of-language-in-childrens-early-educational-outcomes,"Most children develop speech and language skills effortlessly, but some are slow to develop these skills and then go on to struggle with literacy and academic skills throughout their schooling. It is the first few years of life that are critical to their subsequent performance. This study uses a large complex dataset from the Avon longitudinal study of parents and children, also known as ‘Children of the nineties’. This is a population study of children born to mothers in and around the area of Bristol which used to be known as Avon. It examines the characteristics of the environment in which children learn to communicate (such as activities undertaken with children, the mother’s attitude towards her baby, and the wider support available to the family) and the extent to which this affects a child’s readiness for school entry (defined as their early language skills, reading, writing, and maths that they need to help them in school)."
/government/speeches/david-laws-speaks-to-the-national-education-trust-on-raising-standards,"Politicians get asked to give a lot of speeches, but to be asked to give this one is a real honour. Firstly, because I am a great admirer of Roy Blatchford and the National Education Trust. We all have to be involved in a lot of meetings and discussions in our professional careers. Some are productive. Many are not. But I have never met Roy without coming away with a list of 4 or 5 really good ideas which have stimulated my thinking and often directly influenced our policies as a Government. So I guess that at least if it all goes wrong, Roy, I will now have someone else to blame! It is also a privilege to be asked to give a lecture which helps to commemorate the life and work of Mike Baker. I met Mike on a number of occasions while I was Liberal Democrat Education Spokesman in opposition. And, of course, I was acutely aware of his work as a journalist over a long period of time. Mike was, for almost 20 years, the authoritative face and voice of education news. His work was also clear, informed by real analysis and knowledge, but also honest and objective. Of course, many of those who knew Mike well will remember him fondly not just for his educational output but for his personality. This is what one colleague said about him shortly after his death: Mike was often described as a thoroughly nice man, but that fails to express his principled and fundamental respect for others. In a media world where questionable behaviour often stems from large egos and deep insecurities, Mike’s generosity and kindness stood out. He encouraged younger colleagues and was quick to recognise other people’s success. It is for these personal characteristics, rather than their professional achievements that individuals are ultimately most remembered. I am delighted that we are recognising Mike’s life and contribution in this way, and I would like to thank Mike’s daughter, Louise, for being with us tonight. I want to use this opportunity to outline my vision for education, and set out some of the concrete steps that we are taking to make that vision a reality. Over the next decade I want to see English Education complete its journey to the destination of high standards for all. For the last few decades we have, thank goodness, been moving away from an education system which served the needs of 10 or 20% of the population to a system which now serves the needs of a majority. If that journey was an alphabet in which we were seeking to travel from A to Z, I would now judge that we are somewhere around an “M” - in other words around half way to our end destination. Some people will say that is unfair. Too gloomy. I can already hear the predictable voices who will want to argue that massive progress has been made and that little more can reasonably be achieved. But consider just briefly where our education system is today. Our primary floor standard still permits a school to “pass” while 4 in 10 young people fail to secure basic minimum standards of English and Maths after years of schooling. Around 40% of young people fail to secure five GCSEs at C grade and above, including English and Maths - a standard which many parents and employers would already consider to be too low. Shamefully, that same failure rate rises to over 60% when we look only at children from poorer families. As for the outcomes for children who have been in care, they are so low that it is unsurprising that a large number of these young people go straight from education into the criminal justice system. We must as a nation set very big and bold ambitions for what we can achieve. And Ministers in my own department must feel constrained neither by the apparent pessimism of some of those who claim to speak for parents and teachers nor by the understandable temptation to set targets at levels which are limited by our capacity to intervene in schools. Intervention can always target the lowest performers. Intervention capacity must never get in the way of us from setting big ambitions and being impatient about what people refer to as “the urgency of now”. So when I think of an education system in the future what I think of is this: 85 to 90% of young people leaving primary school equipped for real excellence in secondary education. 85 to 90% of young people achieving new, more rigorous, qualifications at Key Stages 4 and 5. A massive closing of the unacceptable performance gaps between young people from advantaged and disadvantaged backgrounds. And schools in every part of the country and in every community in the country where children’s expectations are not constrained or capped by their parent’s skills or incomes or by an expectation that when they reach 16 or 18 they will just dawdle off down the road to whoever is the largest local employer. In every single school in the country, I want children to dream of being doctors, engineers, scientists, head teachers, and even - whisper it - lawyers, journalists, investment bankers and Prime Ministers. So, this vision is one in which the overwhelming majority of children are successful in school. My definition of success is that of children getting the qualifications and grades that will allow them a choice of good jobs, and give them a resilience in the labour market as it evolves over their working lifetime. It is, of course, about more than that. It is about young people becoming well educated citizens who can play their role in society, but - most importantly - make the most of their lives in ways which go well beyond the aspirations of the work place. Music, drama, education for its own sake, these are all crucial elements of a good education. This vision requires a sea-change in expectations for many people. We know that most parents are on side. The millennium cohort study showed that 95% of parents would like their child to attend university. Parents want their children to do well. There are some who claim that children from poor backgrounds cannot succeed. Some people mutter about genetics. Others talk about how poverty is so crushing as to make a school’s job impossible. We know that such views are wrong. We know that they are wrong because the best schools in our country have proven them to be wrong. There are schools in Britain that are succeeding with all their children. On my first day as Minister of State for Schools, I visited one such school with the Deputy Prime Minister - Mulberry School for Girls, in London. Fortunately such schools are no longer the isolated exceptions. These schools show that this vision can and must become a reality. What will this vision mean for pupils, society and for teachers? Firstly, an education system that delivers more highly qualified people is good for the people who end up better educated. Now I realise, of course, that there are people out there who say that more qualifications just means people end up overqualified for the jobs that are available. This is the same argument that was used in the nineteenth century to oppose compulsory schooling and universal literacy. It is the same argument that was used to oppose every rise in the school leaving age and every rise in school standards. It is an argument that has been shown to be wrong time and time again, in Britain and in every other country. It is emphatically not the case that there are a fixed number of skilled jobs, and a fixed number of unskilled jobs. On the contrary, the lesson from the last fifty years is that creating a more skilled workforce leads to the creation of more skilled work. The wage premium for graduates, for example, has not fallen as the number of graduates has tripled. With more graduates, firms create more graduate level positions. The ability of the economy to use people with high levels of generic skills is very great. Sadly, the same is not true at the other end. Mechanisation has been replacing unskilled jobs for two centuries now, and shows no signs of letting up. If you want a sense of the future, just look at the ranks of self-service tills in supermarkets today. Of course, there will always be some unskilled work available. But even today, Britain has too many people with too few skills relative to the demand for such labour. That is why so many of these people are unemployed, and the remainder are largely in low wage employment. Qualifications also bring economic security when times are tough. The Resolution Foundation has recently shown that those with good qualifications are less likely to lose their jobs in a recession. Even if they lose their job, they are more likely to find other work quickly. And - crucially - that work is more likely to be at their previous wage rate. We cannot know how the economy will evolve between now and when the current generation of school children retire, but we can be sure that there will be many changes ahead. We need to equip people to be successful with whatever life throws at them. A good education achieves just that. And we should be aware that other countries are not standing still. Educational standards are rising across the world, particularly in what were formerly defined as “developing” economies. If Britain wants its economy to continue to be globally competitive, it must not lose the race for educational success. The effects of good education on society mirror those for the individual. A society in which people have good jobs, and do not remain unemployed for long when a recession hits, would be a great society to live in. The costs to all of us of failure - having to pay benefits for those let down by a bad education - would fall. Tax revenues would be higher and more stable, allowing us to have lower tax rates, and better public services. And it would be a marvellous world in which to be a teacher. For sure, you would be expected to deliver, and held to account. But you would be part of a system that did deliver, and was seen to deliver. Everyone would know that our schools were some of the best in the world, and would respect teachers as part of that. I want a system where when someone says at a party “I am a teacher”, the person they are talking to sees them as clever, effective and part of a world class system delivering for our country. That, rather than the negative images so often conveyed through the media from the Easter union conferences is what I want people to associate with the great career of teaching in the future. That, then, is the vision. Let me move on to how we get there. Education starts young. It starts at home, when parents and others talk to, and interact with, tiny babies. Our knowledge of brain development tells us that these years are crucial. This is when children from affluent backgrounds get their first head start. I am not criticising poorer parents whose own education was weaker. They want the best for their children as much as anyone. Nor am I criticising more affluent and supportive parents. The desire to do your best for your children is one of the most admirable human characteristics. We should never criticise people for it. The reality is, however, that if the parents’ education is weaker, the child will hear fewer words, and their linguistic skills will lag. By the age of 4, a child from a professional home has heard on average 45 million words. By contrast, at the same age, a child from a disadvantaged family has heard only 13 - one three - million words. That is why I am proud that the Coalition is offering a free early education place to every 2 year old whose parents are not well off. The offer is initially for those who are in the bottom 20%, but will be available to those in the bottom 40% by the end of this parliament. Wherever possible, we have asked local authorities to ensure that these places are in good and outstanding, settings. Funding free early education places for 2 year olds is a huge and expensive undertaking, and our willingness to do it in an era in which money is exceptionally tight demonstrates our commitment to educational success for all. There is an increasingly strong body of evidence that says that the quality of personnel is the most important factor in early years education, just as it is for people in school or even university settings. For that reason we are trying to move away from nurseries for three and four year olds being staffed by people with low skills, on low wages. Our reforms in this area have been controversial, but I am convinced that they are right. This combination of increasing quantity and quality of early years education is designed to ensure that all of our children are school ready when they start school. Early years education is crucial and it must be supported by proper funding, which targets additional resources effectively to the most disadvantaged children. My Party - the Liberal Democrats - has advocated the development of a “Nursery Premium” to complement the Pupil Premium, and this is an issue which I am personally looking at very closely. Let me now move on to primary schools. I think that primary schools are the single most important part of the school system. The reality is that if a child does not succeed at primary school, they are most unlikely to succeed at secondary school and beyond. Let me gave you a rather stark statistic. Only 1 child in 17 who averages level 3 in their key stage two tests goes on to get 5 good GCSEs. Achieving level 4 is not, however, a guarantee of success. A child averaging a 4c in their KS2 assessments has only a 47% chance of getting 5 A*-C including English and Maths. Let me repeat that. A majority of young people who just clear the current primary school bar will fail to achieve the current, relatively modest, performance benchmark in secondary school. I ask you, in all seriousness, how can we in the future define a 4c as a successful outcome at primary level, when the overwhelming majority of 4c children are not on track? I want more children to jump over the existing bar. But we must prepare children for success in secondary school, not for failure or mediocrity. That is why I also announced yesterday - and this was the far more important announcement - that when the new national curriculum comes in, the new primary standard will be higher. There is work to be done on the details, but let me be crystal clear. A pass at 11 will mean that a child is on track to be successful at 16. That will mean a standard at least equal to level 4b at present. Nothing else is good enough. It is some time before we will introduce the new primary assessment and accountability system. I am not willing to wait that long. That is why I am also announcing that for the first time later this year we will be publishing the proportion of children in each school who get a good level 4 - a 4b- or better. These children are on course to succeed at secondary level, and we should recognise and celebrate those schools that do well on this measure. We have not decided what proportion of children we will require to reach that standard for a school to be above the accountability floor standard. But let me give you a sense of my thinking, and my ambition, by recounting a visit I made to a school last week. That school is King Solomon’s Academy, a new ARK school near Paddington Station. Around half of the pupils are on free school meals and two thirds have English as a foreign language. Max, the head, told me that his target was for 85% of children to reach the standard in Key Stage 2 tests. I was impressed. I was even more impressed when Max told me that his standard wasn’t 85% at level 4c, but 85% at 5c. That is why if I stay awake at night it won’t be because I am wondering if the unions and others might be right to criticise the level of our ambition. The best schools, even in the toughest areas, are showing all of us - including my department - the way. They are the real leaders in the education debate. And just let me repeat that target: 85% at level 5 and above. I have looked at what that means. This is the conclusion: those children will be set up for life. More than 9 in 10 children with a level 5 go on to get 5 good GCSEs, with the majority getting far more than that. Those children are then well placed for A levels, and entry into selective universities. Beyond that - well, who knows? The world will be their oyster. So if King Solomon Academy, with half or more of pupils entitled to the Pupil Premium, can deliver that, is it unreasonable to expect that all schools could get almost all children who do not have demonstrable learning difficulties to something akin to level 4b or 4a? Personally, I think that this is a reasonable expectation for every single one of our mainstream schools. Let me turn now to secondary schools. There are some excellent secondary schools in Britain - some of the finest in the world. It was my privilege to write to 400 of the best schools earlier this year, to congratulate them on their excellent results. I wrote to schools with high levels of both attainment and progress. And yet there are schools, and even areas, where too many children still leave with almost nothing to show for 15,000 hours of schooling, and at least £60,000 of taxpayers money. Almost 4 in 10 children in Knowsley and Hull leave school with 5Ds or less at GCSE. That is a disgrace for Knowsley and Hull, and a disgrace for our country. These children are entering adult life with what the OECD PISA studies define as only “basic literacy”. I know that those areas have particular issues, but many of those issues are the same as in some of London’s poorer communities. Yet places in inner London, such as Tower Hamlets, and places in outer London, such as Dagenham, have transformed their educational outcomes over the past decade or so. If we could replicate Tower Hamlets success in raising standards nationwide, the number of children leaving school with only basic literacy would fall by more than three-quarters. Nor is it just poor areas that are struggling. Herefordshire, for example, has some of the lowest proportion of children on free school meals. Yet they have more children than average leaving school without meaningful qualifications. We cannot let such areas’ failures be hidden behind their affluence. I have already been clear that my vision is for an education that works not for 40 or 50%, but for 80 or 90%. That is why I want universal secondary readiness by age 11. And that in turn will allow us to hold secondary schools to a much higher standard. Let me say something about our proposals to reform secondary accountability. We made that announcement on the same day as we announced the new national curriculum, and that we would not be replacing GCSEs with English Baccalaureate Certificates. As such the accountability proposals did not get the attention that they deserve. I think we all know the problems with the existing 5 A*-C including English and Maths threshold. Many schools are allowed to coast, safe in the knowledge that they will cross the line in any case. In other schools, too much pressure is placed on a handful of teachers, teaching a handful of children, while the rest can be given less attention. The system all but guarantees us a 40-50% system, since schools only have to get a small number of extra children over the threshold. Once more, if I am honest, I do not understand how anyone could ever have thought that this was a sensible method by which to judge our schools. We propose instead to judge schools by two yardsticks. The first is a C grade threshold in English and Maths. The reality is that both further education and employers do place a unique value on these qualifications. It is right and proper that schools should do all they can to get as many children over this line as possible. And there are schools up and down the country who achieve amazing results on this measure. The head of Bishop Rawstorne school in Lancashire gave a seminar in the department recently. 81% of his pupils get at least a C in both subjects. It can be done, and, bluntly, it must be done. The second yardstick is the average progress pupils make in 8 subjects. These 8 must include English and Maths, any three EBACC subjects, and any 3 other subjects. This last group can be traditional academic subjects, or creative subjects, or vocational subjects. This yardstick rewards those schools that get a pupil who is genuinely struggling up from 5Es to 7Ds. It rewards those schools that get bright pupils up from 7Bs to 8A*s. In fact, we think it rewards all schools for teaching all pupils well. The accountability proposals are just that: proposals. If you like them, please tell us, and please tell us why you like them. And if you don’t like them, please tell us and please tell us why. Our response to the consultation on qualifications shows that we listen. At some level it is hard to dislike my vision. It would be odd if people in this room were going to object to more people getting a better education. But it is legitimate to ask whether we can deliver. I have already outlined our new policies for 2 year olds from disadvantaged backgrounds. Our policies to improve the quality of those educating the under 5s. How rises in the primary threshold, and in due course a higher standard, will ensure that more children enter secondary school ready to engage with physics, history, languages and so on. I have set out how the new proposed secondary accountability regime will give secondary schools an incentive to improve outcomes for all. But let me talk now about two other crucial policies. The first is the pupil premium. I have believed in the pupil premium ever since LSE Professor Julian Le Grand came up with the idea in the late 1980s, and since it was further developed by Nick Clegg at a time when he sat in the European Parliament. Nick is actually the politician who deserves the credit for picking up this ball and running with it. I am proud to be part of the government that has now delivered the Pupil Premium. And I take very seriously my responsibility to make it work. The Education Endowment Foundation has done excellent work to build a robust evidence base as to which approaches make a difference. Put simply, a school that follows their recommendations is overwhelmingly likely to see the performance of children from disadvantaged backgrounds improve. That in turn can be a life changing experience. So the pupil premium is capable of achieving great things in our schools and in our society. But not all schools are using it effectively. There are some who say that I should direct schools as to how to use the pupil premium. I do not want to that. It can never make sense for a minister in Whitehall to issue central diktats saying that schools must do X or Y. Such an approach would be odd coming from someone proud to describe themselves as liberal. There are others who say that I should take it away from schools whose pupils do badly. Again, I do not wish to follow this approach, interesting though it may be. I would worry that schools would choose to return the money rather than educate those children well. I would worry that we would be penalising the next cohort for the failures of the previous, locking in a cycle of repeated failure and fines. But failure is not an option. Where schools are successful, they will have the freedom to use the money as they see fit. Ofsted will judge schools, and their reports will look explicitly at the performance of disadvantaged pupils. Ofsted have made it clear that doing well for these pupils will be a requirement to be rated good or outstanding. But where schools are neither good nor outstanding, and where pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds are doing particularly poorly, we will not stand back. In those circumstances, we will be introducing a policy proposed to us by the National College of School Leaders. Let me be clear that the following only applies to category 3 schools that are also category 3 for leadership, and which have low attainment for disadvantaged children. In these cases the school will be required to draw up an action plan for the pupil premium in consultation with a system leader - perhaps a national leader in education, perhaps someone from another school with a particularly good track record in this area. Ofsted will then take that plan, and adherence to that plan, into account when they decide the future of the school. And if the school continues to fail, well, Ofsted category 4 beckons. Avoiding that outcome is a real incentive for school leaders. Finally, I want to hint at new thinking in the department. We are aware of the success of London challenge. People have asked us why we cannot create a Doncaster challenge, or a Hull challenge. The reality is that things are more complicated. The London Challenge started off with some huge advantages. First, almost every school in London has a large number of schools within easy distance that look roughly like them. It is easy to group schools in London so that they can learn from others with whom they readily identify. Second, London challenge happened in an era in which government spent money as if there was no tomorrow. Well, tomorrow has arrived, and we cannot do that. We realise that there is a challenge, and we are working with a range of partners to develop innovative solutions to improve standards outside of London. Those children, in my constituency and elsewhere are just as important as any other. We will not rest until we have delivered a range of measures that will ensure that all schools have access to the best teachers, the best leaders, and the best thinking about what makes a good school. As part of this, we will hold Local Authorities and Academy Chains fully to account for supporting and intervening when necessary in their schools. The bright light of accountability will be shone in all places without fear or favour. Today I have set out a vision. I have told you what we have already done to start to deliver on that vision. And I have given you a sense of the challenges that we are working on at present. Now I look forward to your questions and comments. And for those of you are school leaders or teachers, I genuinely hope that we can work in partnership to design better policies and to realise the ambitious visions that we all have for our schools, our children and our country."

The scheme is aimed at helping over 6,000 new childcare businesses in England with set up, training and adapting premises costs. The scheme is also focussed on making sure there is more childcare available for women wanting to go back to work. Maria Miller said: “ Thousands of people have already applied for a grant, but I want even more people to benefit. The Government is determined to help people who want to get on and realise their ambitions so I would urge anyone who is interested to apply as soon as possible to ensure they don’t miss out.” Mentoring help New childcare businesses are also being encouraged to team up with a free mentor so they can access free and specially-tailored start-up advice. Becky Padley received a cash grant in October 2013 and is now running her own child minding business in Sheffield. She said: “ Without the help of the grant, setting up my business wouldn’t have been possible. I used the cash to join the Professional Association for Childcare and Early Years, join the national childcare register, pay for my Disclosure and Barring Service checks and also do some advertising. Without this money I wouldn’t have been able to afford to do any of that.” Find out how to apply for a grant."
/government/speeches/speech-to-association-of-school-and-college-leaders-conference-2015,"Thank you for that introduction. As Joan has already mentioned, Michael can’t be here today. He would dearly have loved to be able to speak to you from this platform but, unfortunately, he is preparing to go into hospital tomorrow for a planned operation. He has asked me to pass on his best wishes for a successful conference and looks forward to meeting many of you in the summer term at our series of launch events for the future of education inspection. In the meantime, with your permission, he has asked me, as Ofsted’s National Director for Schools, to deliver this speech on his behalf. Michael has often spoken about the qualities common to the best school and college leaders. Perhaps chief among these qualities is optimism. Optimism here is not that which is borne of wishful, woolly thinking but rather the optimism that is rooted in a hard-headed reality about what can be done to bring about improvement. An optimism that, above all, is underpinned by something fundamental: a belief in young people and in the power of education to improve their own life chances and the wider well-being of society. Optimistic leaders are rarely satisfied with the status quo. They are always challenging their students, their staff and indeed themselves to strive harder and to do better. Many of these optimistic leaders are of course in this room today. And despite the difficulties our education system in England still faces, you have much to be optimistic about. More children are getting a better education, with 8 in 10 schools now judged to be good or outstanding. Schools previously less than good are improving at a faster rate than ever before, partly as a result of strong collaboration between heads and HMI. More young people are going to university – although we need to get more state-educated youngsters into the most prestigious universities. The calibre – if not the numbers – of graduates entering the teaching profession is better now than it has been for many years. That is why there has never been a better time for the best school and college leaders to take control of improving the state education system in this country. I will say more about this shortly. Of course, even the most resilient headteacher will inevitably find their optimism put under strain when they have to take difficult decisions, challenge complacency, confront vested interests and tackle under-performance on a daily basis. It can also be difficult to sustain a positive outlook when there is always the nagging worry about how you’re going to fill that maths vacancy or when your head of English has just handed in her notice. The declining number of new trainees joining the profession is, indeed, a pressing concern, which I know is exercising many of you. As our last annual report highlighted, problems in teacher supply, coupled with a rising school population, are providing a real challenge to our school system, especially in those areas that are finding it most difficult to recruit. The Chief Inspector has commissioned an investigation into this whole issue which we will report on next term. And I appreciate these difficulties are sometimes compounded by the seemingly constant state of change and upheaval in our education system. Continual policy shifts around the curriculum and assessment, and examination arrangements can be destabilising. You need to be able to plan for the medium and long-term with a degree of certainty. That’s why both Michael and I would endorse the idea of a fully independent body to advise the Secretary of State on the impact of any future reforms. We also acknowledge that Ofsted has been partly responsible for this sense of permanent flux – although we can only offer a partial apology for that. Michael’s decision to remove the satisfactory grade and replace it with ‘requires improvement’ was, for example, a difficult one to make. But it was unquestionably the right one because it has galvanised the system to do significantly better. So headship is great but it is also tough, sometimes grindingly hard and often very lonely, especially when you are dealing with personnel issues. In many respects, it bears some strong parallels to the job of an Ofsted inspector. They also have to make unpopular decisions, challenge the status quo and tackle vested interests in the relentless pursuit of higher standards for children and learners. This can often be daunting and difficult. Occasionally, it can be deeply unpleasant and intimidating. We have seen in recent weeks how some of Her Majesty’s Inspectors in the north east have been at the receiving end of some particularly lurid smears and accusations about their professional conduct – some of it emblazoned across the pages of the national press and even repeated on the floor of the House of Commons. It’s of little consolation to these HMI – obliged to stay silent when their professional integrity is being called into question – that many of these claims fail to stand up to even the most superficial scrutiny. It is right that we have a robust complaints process, but the type of mud-slinging and public bad-mouthing of inspectors we have seen recently seems to reflect a tendency on the part of a minority of institutions to deflect attention from their own palpable failure to tackle serious issues – whether that’s bullying, poor behaviour, safeguarding or inadequate teaching. Those who accuse Ofsted of being too heavy-handed in getting to the root of these matters would no doubt be the first to criticise us if we had failed to uncover these problems when we had the chance. Inspecting British values has also made life difficult for Ofsted. Nevertheless, we are not shirking this responsibility. It is one of the most important things we are doing. I say this because schools, particularly those in mono-cultural areas, are on the frontline of ensuring that our society doesn’t become fragmented and divided. We have all seen in recent months what can happen when this frontline is breached. All our schools, whether secular or of faith, have a huge responsibility for teaching children and young people about the society in which they live and for promoting understanding, tolerance and respect for others. As all of you know, tolerance is predicated on knowledge and understanding, so this is where we are focusing our inspectors’ efforts, to ensure that schools promote these important values. Our inspectors have had to go into schools serving predominantly Muslim communities in Birmingham and Tower Hamlets, Jewish schools in Hackney, and Christian schools in the north east and say some uncomfortable things about how these institutions were failing to prepare their pupils for life in modern Britain. This has been a tough call. But it is absolutely essential, for the reasons I have already mentioned, that we apply the same principles and inspect by the same standards in every school in every part of the country. Challenging intolerance – in all its forms – is the right thing for all schools to be doing. And of course the great majority of schools are getting this right already through strong PSHE, citizenship and RE programmes. They don’t grab the headlines but are far more typical than the minority of schools that Ofsted has found to be failing in this increasingly important aspect of the curriculum. I believe we were right to go into the schools in Birmingham last year and to report our findings and judgements as we did. These schools deserved their previous good or outstanding ratings because the headteachers who were in control at the time had worked incredibly hard to raise standards. It was only when these same heads were pushed out or marginalised by governors that things started to go wrong. The episode highlighted how rapidly schools – especially those in challenging areas – can decline and deteriorate in the absence of careful monitoring between inspections. Of course, inspection is never going to be an exact science – nor should it be. However, I do recognise that the inspection stakes are higher than they’ve ever been before. That is why the pressure on Ofsted to get it right is so intense. I genuinely believe we do get it right most of the time and providers continue to report high levels of satisfaction with their inspections. Indeed, a new report we’ve published today shows more than 8 out of 10 leaders, surveyed a few months after their Ofsted inspection, said it had helped them to improve by providing an accurate analysis of their strengths and weaknesses. But we know we need to continue driving up the quality and the consistency of inspection. Two things will help. The first of these is ensuring that we involve an ever greater number of serving leaders in inspection. In the last 3 years there has been a significant increase in the number of both HMI and additional inspectors recruited straight from good or outstanding institutions. We have gone from recruiting only 11 serving heads to school HMI posts in the 3 years before Michael became Chief Inspector to making 49 such appointments in the last 12 months alone. Sixty per cent of all inspections now have a serving leader on the team. And by the start of the next academic year, well over 70 per cent of our Ofsted school inspectors will be drawn from the ranks of current practitioners. The second thing I believe will help to drive up quality further is our decision to bring the contracting of additional school and FE inspectors in-house from this September. I very much share Michael’s view that ending Ofsted’s outsourcing arrangements and the use of commercial third party providers for inspection is long overdue. I have absolutely no doubt that it will help improve the quality of inspection and, just as importantly, instil greater confidence and credibility in the process. As you know, we have also recently consulted on a far-reaching set of reforms to our inspection of early years settings, schools and colleges. From September, we will introduce a new ‘common inspection framework’, with a single set of overarching areas for judgement that will apply to each education remit. There will be radical change to the way we inspect most good schools and colleges – frequent but shorter inspections, with a strong emphasis on professional dialogue to establish whether the institution remains good or is starting to slide. It’s worth remembering that currently around 800 schools a year decline from good. We hope this new approach will reduce that number considerably. These shorter inspections will result in a letter to you, published to governors and to parents explaining why inspectors believe the school is still good, while pointing out particular strengths and areas for attention. Of course, where the inspection team believe the school may have more serious problems, they will convert to a full section 5 inspection and subsequent report. Let me give you an example of how I envisage the new short inspections working. Let’s say results in a school have suffered a dip because of problems in the maths department while everything else looks stable. After visiting the school, the inspectors assess that the head is clear about why this has happened and has a credible plan for addressing the situation. In that instance, the school’s ‘good’ judgement would be confirmed, and it will have a clear mandate to improve the areas identified over the next couple of years. The response to our consultation on these important changes has, I’m pleased to say, been overwhelmingly positive. Regulations have now been laid to enable us to carry out the new short inspections. Pilot inspections to test the new arrangements have been going on all term and are currently being evaluated. We will shortly be holding focus groups with school leaders, teachers and parents to seek their views on the format and content of the reports from the new short inspections. And, as I’ve mentioned, we will be holding a series of regional conferences in June and July to launch the new inspection handbooks. Ultimately, three key factors will determine whether a school remains good – each of them firmly centred on leadership. First, does the leadership know what is going on in their school or college and have a sound grasp of relative strengths and weaknesses? Second, is there a credible plan to address any weaknesses and maintain the strengths? And third, is the culture sufficiently aspirational, creating the conditions for the institution to forge ahead? Arguably, the last of these is the most important of all because a school or college will only succeed if it has the right culture. As all of you know, if you get a school’s culture right, most other things will fall into place. You will all, I hope, have had time to read our annual report published in December. Its main headline was that while primary schools continue to improve, there were some worrying signs that secondary schools, overall, are struggling to sustain the progress of recent years. We reported that there are, of course, many secondaries where leadership is excellent, teaching inspirational and a strong learning culture permeates through the classrooms and corridors. Indeed it was good to report that there are more outstanding secondary schools than primaries. However, there are also too many examples of pupils leaving their primary school only to encounter a secondary school culture that demotivates and discourages them. In these weaker secondaries, we reported that poor behaviour was too prevalent. Our inspection findings backed up the conclusions of an Ofsted-commissioned survey of teachers and parents last year which found that pupils in England were potentially losing up to an hour of learning each day because of low-level disruption – that equates to 38 days of teaching lost every year. We also reported that progress made by children in literacy and numeracy at primary was not being sustained. We are increasingly concerned that, in too many schools, the early years of secondary school are failing to build on the improvements witnessed in primaries. It’s for this reason that Michael has commissioned a survey into progress at Key Stage 3. This report will also be ready next term. Additionally, we said that disadvantaged pupils were not closing the gap in attainment with their better-off peers. And finally, more able children were not being stretched, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds. Earlier this month, we published a follow-up to our 2013 survey examining whether our most able students in the non-selective system were being properly challenged and encouraged to fulfill their potential. The criticisms we made in this new report were a dispiriting echo of the ones we levelled 2 years ago, at those schools which are not supporting their most able schools adequately. So those: not setting high enough expectations of what their brighter students are capable of with weak transition arrangements for pupils at the end of the primary stage not prioritising high quality teaching in the vital early years of secondary school with a reluctance to debunk the all-too-common perception among comprehensive school children that our most prestigious universities are for ‘other people’ We did, however, see other schools which were rising to the challenge by delivering tailored teaching that stretched and enriched the brightest students, insisting on robust tracking processes and refusing to place a false ceiling on ambition. Ofsted will be sharpening its focus even more in the coming months on the progress and achievement of the most able children from disadvantaged backgrounds. The issues highlighted in the annual report need to be tackled in order to prevent the improvements of recent years going into reverse. However, they shouldn’t eclipse the very real achievements we have witnessed in our state education system over the past decade, which I referred to at the outset. While Ofsted and the other levers of accountability have played an important part in raising standards, these achievements are down to the fact we have the best generation of leaders working in our comprehensive schools, leading a very fine cohort of teachers. Like Michael, I have always subscribed to the principle of schools catering for children of all abilities. It’s the only school model that can realistically educate all our children to a standard they deserve and the country demands. And it’s the model favoured by almost all our major international competitors. In any case, our all-ability schools are a lot better than many of their critics allow. This is partly because of raised expectations from Ofsted but it’s mostly because we now have so many headteachers and principals like you committed to running proudly academic schools and refusing to accept mediocrity or poor teaching. It is for this reason, as I have already suggested, that there has never been a better time for the best heads to take ownership of system improvement. I know that this is the main theme of your conference. As Michael told members of the education select committee earlier this year, we are moving incrementally and inexorably towards clusters of schools supporting and evaluating each other, led by an outstanding headteacher of an outstanding school. That is all to the good as long as we have the right people leading this process for the right reasons. People who are not motivated by self-aggrandisement or self-enrichment but are doing it because they are passionate about improving the prospects of young people well beyond their own school gates. As Michael also told the committee, if Ofsted is still around in 10 years’ time, the way we inspect and what we inspect would be very different in the type of school-led improvement system envisioned in the ASCL blueprint. If that is the case for the future, I would see Ofsted’s role being to moderate judgements and assess the robustness of peer-review arrangements – making sure they weren’t just cosy fireside chats between colleagues. So long as leaders are well trained and knowledgeable in review techniques, and rigour is maintained, the idea of schools evaluating each other’s performance is something we strongly support as the way forward. Ofsted is keen to work with the grain in this respect. Indeed, our efforts to bring on board a far higher proportion of current practitioners to carry out inspections could be seen as a key staging post on this journey towards a fully realised self-improving system. I will be saying more about this tomorrow at my break-out session, so I hope some of you will be joining me for that. But that lies in the future. For the time being, Ofsted will continue to work with ASCL and others to ensure that the changes we’re making achieve our shared goals and ambitions for the nation’s education system. Ofsted is not an inflexible, immutable organisation. We do listen and take notice of what the profession is telling us. We have acted on your concerns about no-notice inspections, about the drawbacks of outsourcing inspections and the need to avoid making every inspection the same ‘cliff-edge’ experience. And we will continue – through our ‘mythbusting’ document and other means – to try to curb unnecessary workload pressures on teachers by dispelling some of the common misconceptions about what Ofsted requires when it inspects a school or college. Leadership teams need to justify their practices around marking, pupil feedback and lesson planning, observation and grading on their own merits rather than erroneously citing Ofsted as the reason for doing these things. In doing all this, it’s important that none of us forgets that Ofsted exists principally for parents and children. Our primary purpose will always be to champion the right of every child to a decent education. When we ask parents what they want from Ofsted, they invariably say they would like us to inspect their child’s school at least once a year and without notice. So of course, we have to take account of the views of the profession. But we have to balance the wishes of teachers and leaders with those who rely on the services we inspect. So, in conclusion… I began this speech by saying that the best heads are optimists and by sharing my belief that there is much to be optimistic about. As we approach the general election, we are at a watershed moment in the history of our education system in this country. I have very little doubt that during the 5 years of the next parliament, we will continue to see our education sector evolve further down the path towards a fully self-improving system. I am determined to ensure that Ofsted plays its part in that evolution. We want to give more and more school leaders the opportunity to use the skills, knowledge and insight they gain through their experience of inspection to benefit their own schools and those with whom they partner. And, in turn, Ofsted will benefit from having so many talented and cutting-edge practitioners helping to shape inspection and to make it the best it possibly can be to deliver higher standards and improved outcomes for pupils. Thank you very much for listening and, on behalf of Sir Michael, for all the great work you are doing."
/government/statistics/neighbourhood-statistics-small-area-pupil-attainment-by-pupil-characteristics-in-england-2010,"Reference Id: SFR09/2011 Publication type: Statistical First Release Publication data: Underlying statistical data Local authority data: LAD data Region: England Release date: 25 May 2011 Coverage status: Final/provisional Publication status: Published These latest statistics complement the 2009 attainment figures which were previously published on 13 May 2010. Institution-based tables for 2009 to 2010 were published on 25 May 2011. Pupil residency-based tables for 2009 to 2010 were published on 16 June 2011. The following data is available. Tables based on the geographic location of institution (early years setting, school or college): Pupil attainment by gender at EYFSP, KS1, KS2, KS4 and KS5 referenced by location of educational institution at national, regional, local authority district (LAD) and middle layer super output area (MSOA) level (EYFSP and KS1 only). Pupil residency-based tables: Pupil attainment by gender at EYFSP, KS1, KS4 and KS5 referenced by location of pupil residence, at national, regional, LAD, MSOA and lower layer super output area (LSOA) level. Pupil attainment by gender at KS2 down to LAD level. Pupil attainment by FSM eligibility at EYFSP, KS1 and KS4 referenced by location of pupil residence, at national, regional, LAD and MSOA level. Pupil attainment by FSM eligibility at KS2 down to LAD level. Pupil attainment by ethnic group at EYFSP, KS1, KS2, KS4 and KS5 referenced by location of pupil residence, at national, regional and LAD level. The key points from the latest release are: Institution-based tables: The tables reinforce previous messages about patterns of attainment and about the relationship between attainment and gender at national, regional and local levels. At EYFSP, a higher percentage of girls achieved a good level of development than boys in all LADs. Girls continue to perform better than boys in the majority of LADs at KS1, particularly in English subjects. At KS2 girls perform better than boys in English, and in the majority of LADs in English and maths combined but not in maths. At KS4 and KS5, girls also outperform boys in the large majority of LADs. There is evidence of local variation in the extent to which the gap between boys and girls is either increasing or closing across key stages and subjects across the country. Pupil residency-based tables: The tables reinforce the relationship between attainment and gender, attainment and FSM eligibility and attainment and ethnicity identified in previous publications across Key Stages. At EYFSP, resident girls consistently perform better than resident boys in all LADs. At KS1 and KS2, resident girls also perform better than resident boys, particularly in English subjects. At KS4 and KS5, resident girls also outperform resident boys in all but a small number of LADs. Overall, non-FSM pupils perform significantly better than FSM pupils in all areas of the country. The performance gap starts at EYFSP and continues through Key Stages 1, 2 and 4. Chinese pupils continue to have the highest levels of attainment across all key stages and almost all regions. Black pupils have some of the lowest levels of attainment across the country across all key stages. Lizzie Brocklehurst 020 7783 8781 lizzie.brocklehurst@education.gsi.gov.uk"

/government/news/more-families-in-need-supported-by-childrens-centres,"Children’s centres are reaching over 90% of families most in need, research has revealed today (11 June 2014). Last year more than 1 million parents received help and support on all aspects of family life through children’s centres. Today’s report shows an overwhelming number of families are accessing high-quality, targeted services. Education and Childcare Minister Elizabeth Truss said: It is great news to see that children’s centres are performing better than ever. Today’s figures prove that centres are successfully reaching out to those families most in need, with the vast majority of parents happy with the services they’ve received - from stay and play and health checks, to back to work support for parents. The government’s clear that children’s centres have a vital role to play in making sure families get the help they need by offering a wide range of local, flexible services so they can choose what works best for their family. Today’s evidence shows that centres are doing just that - acting as a valuable lifeline for families up and down the country. Over 88% of families most in need have told the Department fro Education ( DfE ) that the services in their area are good, providing a multitude of invaluable services for all parents and families, including: almost all centres are offering stay and play services - providing stimulating and challenging activities for young children over 90% of centres offer individual home-based family support - reaching out to those parents most in need 81% are offering activities and hobbies for parents three-quarters are offering health checks for parents and their children - ensuring they are growing up fit and healthy around two-thirds of centres provide breastfeeding support for new mothers The report comes as Ofsted is considering how the inspection framework can be changed with the aim of overhauling and modernising the way they look at these centres. There are currently over 3,000 children’s centres open across the country, providing tailored and specialist services for local parents and children, with a further 531 additional premises providing children’s centre services as part of a network. Centres are inspected individually or in small groups, with each centre receiving its own rating on services provided as well as the quality of management. Ofsted is now planning to inspect all the children’s centres in each local authority area together as well as local authority oversight to make sure all children are being supported. It will consult on the new approach later in the year - helping ensure that all centres tailor services that meet the needs of local families. The government wants children’s centres to reach out to local parents, improving outcomes for both young children and their families by supporting child development, boosting parenting skills and improving health and life chances. This is just one of many government reforms to improve support for all children - no matter what their starting point in life. The government is also extending free early education to around 260,000 disadvantaged 2-year-olds, and has: increased free early education for 3- and 4-year-olds to 15 hours a week encouraged schools to offer more childcare made it easier for good and outstanding childminders to offer free early education Notes to editor Read ‘ Evaluation of children’s centres in England interim findings ’. There are 3,019 children’s centres open across the country with 531 additional sites as part of a network. Funding for early education and intervention has also increased from £4.3 billion in 2011 to 2012 to £4.6 billion in 2014 to 2015. [Contact:997]"

/government/speeches/funding-allocations,"I am today announcing capital funding to provide the extra places needed for our growing population, and to implement the universal infant free school meals entitlement. I am also pleased to publish Sebastian James’s review of progress since his original 2011 report on education capital. I am also announcing the government’s main school funding allocations for 2014-15 through the Dedicated Schools Grant ( DSG ) and the Education Services Grant ( ESG ). This government’s overriding priority for capital investment is to ensure every child has a place at school. Demographic pressures have put strain on schools in many parts of the country. That is why we have more than doubled funding for new places to £5 billion in this parliament. By May 2013, this investment had already helped to create an additional 260,000 school places with more still to come. Today I am announcing further funding for new school places up to 2017. We are giving local authorities longer-term allocations for new school places, which will give them more certainty in their planning. We are targeting funding more effectively, based on local needs, through using data we have collected from local authorities about the size of schools and forecast pupil projections. We are also analysing local authority capital expenditure on new school places, so that there is greater accountability and transparency around how they use these funds. The major investment I am announcing today will enable local authorities to make sure that there are enough school places for every child who needs one in the years to come. The number of pupils in England is rising and is set to continue to rise well into the next Parliament. Ensuring that every child is able to attend a good or outstanding school in their local area is at the heart of the government’s comprehensive programme of reform of the school system. To achieve this we will provide an additional £2.35 billion to support local authorities to plan and create new school places that will be needed by 2017. This is additional to the £5 billion that has been allocated between 2011-15. Extending the allocations to a three year period will allow local authorities to plan strategically for the places they need. I have listened to the particular challenges faced by London, and therefore the methodology used to allocate funding for 2015-17 takes into account the higher costs of building in the capital. I am also announcing further details about capital investment in 2014-15 to support universal free school meals for children in reception, Year 1 and Year 2 in state-funded schools. As part of the Autumn Statement the Chancellor confirmed £150 million of capital funding for improving school kitchen and dining facilities in order to offer every infant pupil a free nutritious school meal at lunchtime. Universal free school meals for primary school pupils were a key recommendation of the independent School Food Plan produced for the department by Henry Dimbleby and John Vincent in July 2013. The aim is to improve academic attainment and healthy eating, and save families money. Turning to revenue funding, the distribution of the Dedicated Schools Grant ( DSG ) to local authorities will continue to be based on the current “spend-plus” methodology for 2014-15, set out in three spending blocks for each authority: an early years block, a schools block and a high needs block. The underlying schools budget will be kept at flat cash per pupil for 2014-15. To protect local authorities with falling pupil numbers we will continue with arrangements to ensure that no authority loses more than 2% of its budget in cash terms. Although the overall schools budget will stay at the same level on a per pupil basis before the addition of the Pupil Premium, the actual level of each school’s individual budget will vary. To protect schools from significant budget reductions, we will continue with a Minimum Funding Guarantee that ensures that no school sees more than a 1.5% per pupil reduction in 2014-15 budgets (excluding sixth form funding) compared with 2013-14 and before the Pupil Premium is added. As part of the DSG , I am announcing 2014-15 revenue funding allocations to local authorities to secure early learning places for two-year-olds from lower income households. From 1 September 2013 early learning became a statutory entitlement for around 20% of two-year-olds across England, which will extend to 40% of two-year-olds from September 2014. To deliver this, the government is today allocating £760 million to fund the extended programme in 2014-15. The Department of Energy and Climate Change ( DECC ) announced on 10 December 2012, that all state funded schools in England will be withdrawn from participating in the CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme from April 2014. This means that local authorities will no longer be required to administer the CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme on behalf of schools. A deduction of £50.5 million will be made from the DSG for 2014-15 to compensate the Exchequer for the loss of revenue resulting from local authorities no longer needing to meet the costs of purchasing carbon allowances for schools under the scheme. As schools will no longer need to meet these requirements, they will be no worse off as a result of this change. The distribution of the Education Services Grant ( ESG ) is based on a total figure of £1.03 billion transferred from local government funding as announced in December 2012. The new grant will be allocated on a simple per-pupil basis to local authorities. Details of today’s announcement will be sent to local authorities and be published on the Department for Education website. Copies will be placed in the House library."

/government/news/commission-calls-for-views-on-childcare--2,"Parents, early years professionals and others with an interest in childcare are today being urged to come forward with their ideas to help improve the accessibility and affordability of childcare. The childcare commission - which was announced by the prime minister last month and is led by ministers Sarah Teather and Maria Miller - is calling for evidence and ideas on how to make childcare more affordable for working families and reduce any unnecessary burdens on providers. We know that wrap around care is a particular issue for working parents, and the commission is especially interested in ways to improve the availability of provision before and after regular school hours and during school holidays. The commission is looking at: ways to encourage out of hours provision, so that parents are able to access care for their child when they need it; identifying any regulation that is not needed to ensure safety or quality; and how childcare helps to get parents into work and out of poverty. Prime Minister David Cameron said: I know hard-working families are struggling with the costs of childcare at the moment and we are determined to do more to help; that is why we launched the affordable childcare commission. Today the commission is asking for views from the public, and I urge the everyday experts - the parents, childminders and nursery owners - to get in touch with ideas for how we can make the system better and more affordable. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said: For many parents, getting access to good quality, affordable childcare is a real concern. We want to hear from parents and childcare providers, to get their views on how we can continue to provide first-class care without breaking the bank or being too complicated. Decent early education makes a huge difference to a child’s future, equipping them to succeed at school and ultimately get on in life. So it’s important we get it right. Sarah Teather, Minister for Children and Families, said: I know at this time of year that parents across the country are concerned about holiday childcare cover. They want an affordable and high quality service. I also want to hear ideas on how we can improve the affordability and quality of childcare in this country. Early education can help children advance and catch up, and help them prepare for school. It’s one of the most important and powerful factors in determining a child’s future. We have an ambitious programme to extend the entitlement to free hours at a nursery or childminder to those two-year-olds who most need it. More than a quarter of a million two-year-olds will benefit from learning through play and stories in just two years’ time. So it’s really important that we get this right and I hope we will receive many strong and fruitful ideas. Early education has been a success story. Statistics published last month show that more than 1,264,000 young children benefited from free early education in 2012. Parents are happy with the service that is being delivered. Almost 90 per cent of parents said they were satisfied with free early education. Maria Miller, Work and Pensions Minister, said: Billions of pounds are spent by government subsidising childcare for families yet many low income families still struggle to make work pay. Universal Credit will help tens of thousands more low income families get help with childcare costs for the first time. We want parents and providers to work with us to overhaul the current system of support to make it more effective in supporting families juggle work and family life. In total the government invests around £5 billion each year in early education and childcare. Investment in the free early education entitlement is around £2 billion each year. In addition the government invests nearly £2 billion each year to help parents with the cost of childcare, mostly through Working Tax Credit. Further financial support of around £800 million is provided through tax and national insurance relief on childcare vouchers, directly contracted childcare and workplace nurseries (administered by employers). Ministers recently announced an extra £300 million for childcare support under Universal Credit which will help around 80,000 more families work the hours they choose and for the first time support parents who want to work under 16 hours a week. The call for evidence runs from 19 July until 31 August. The commission will report to the prime minister and the deputy prime minister in the autumn. Notes to editors There is more information and the opportunity to provide feedback to the childcare commission on both the DfE and DWP websites. The consultation will run until 31 August 2012. The government is also considering the findings of Professor Cathy Nutbrown’s report, Foundations for Quality - the independent review of early education and childcare qualifications , which looks to enhance quality in the sector. The government will respond later this year. ‘Starting Well’ , produced by the Economist Intelligence Unit, ranked the UK fourth out of 45 countries in terms of quality, availability and affordability of early education for three- to six-year-olds, ahead of Denmark, France and the Netherlands. Good examples of holiday and wraparound care are at schools in Wigmore Primary Academy in Hertfordshire, which stepped in when two privately run nurseries closed. In addition, the Free School Norwich incorporates on-site affordable childcare, allowing working parents to take children to school on the way to work and collect them from the same place at the end of the working day. Childcare is available six days each week for 51 weeks of the year. [Contact:997]"

/government/news/national-curriculum-review-launched,"The Secretary of State for Education today announced a major review of the national curriculum in England. The review will be led by the Department for Education, supported by an advisory committee and expert panel made up of top teachers, academics and business representatives. The review will: replace the current substandard curriculum with one based on the best school systems in the world, providing a world-class resource for teachers and children consider what subjects should be compulsory at what age consider what children should be taught in the main subjects at what age Education Secretary Michael Gove said: We have sunk in international league tables and the national curriculum is substandard. Meanwhile the pace of economic and technological change is accelerating and our children are being left behind. The previous curriculum failed to prepare us for the future. We must change course. Our review will examine the best school systems in the world and give us a world-class curriculum that will help teachers, parents and children know what children should learn at what age. Chair of the expert panel, Tim Oates, said: The national curriculum that we have at the moment has led teachers to move with undue pace through material and encouraged a ‘tick list’ approach to teaching. We will work with the advisory committee, as well as appraising carefully both international and national research, as part of this review. We will make changes only where justified, in order to avoid unnecessary disruption to the education system. Members of the advisory committee and expert group welcomed today’s review. Shahed Ahmed, Head of Elmhurst Primary School, Forest Gate, and advisory committee member, said: I believe this review will be very helpful to re-establish that the best way to teach the primary national curriculum is through a rigorous subject-based approach. It would also be very helpful if the national curriculum is slimmed down so that schools have more time and flexibility to fit in what else they think it important to have in their own school curriculum. I also think it important to emphasise that a good grounding in the basics is the foundation to being creative. Dame Yasmin Bevan, Executive Principal and Head of Denbigh High School and Challney High School for Boys, and advisory committee member, said: We need a national curriculum review to establish clarity about what teachers must teach, what children must learn and what parents can expect of their children’s learning. We want to avoid overload, allowing time to ensure concepts, knowledge skills and understanding are fully developed. We also want to establish clarity about the standards we expect our young people to achieve so that they can compete confidently with the best of their peers globally. Mike Harris, education skills lead at the Institute of Directors, and advisory committee member, said: Education is on the frontline of the battle for the UK’s future competitiveness. We need to be confident that what we teach, the way in which we teach it, and how we assess and examine the knowledge we impart, matches the best in the world. The national curriculum review will play an important part in that effort. Professor Nigel Thrift, Vice Chancellor, Warwick University, and advisory committee member, said: The national curriculum review is important for universities. We need a national curriculum that delivers the knowledge children need to attend university and we need it now. Too often we find that, despite teachers’ hard work and dedication, children do not have what we would consider as the basics in the disciplines that they wish to study at university, and the hope is that - in conjunction with other changes in the educational landscape - this state of affairs can be changed for the better. Professor Dylan Wiliam, former Deputy Director at the Institute of Education, Professor of Educational Assessment, and expert panel member, said: There is growing acceptance all over the world that the quality of the teacher is the most important determinant of how much students learn. In this context, it makes sense to check that the national curriculum provides the right balance between providing a firm structure for shared national expectations for what students should learn and allowing enough scope for teachers to have the freedom to use their creativity to maximise student learning. Notes to editors The government set out in the Coalition Agreement its commitment to give schools greater freedom over the curriculum. As part of that commitment, the government has announced proposals for a systematic and comprehensive review of the national curriculum in England for 5- to 16-year-olds. It is important to distinguish between the national curriculum and the wider school curriculum. The national curriculum was originally envisaged as a guide to study in key subjects, which would give parents and teachers confidence that students were acquiring the knowledge necessary at every level of study to make appropriate progress. As it has developed, the national curriculum has come to cover more subjects, prescribe more outcomes and take up more school time than originally intended. It is the government’s intention that the national curriculum be slimmed down so that it properly reflects the body of essential knowledge all children should learn and does not absorb the overwhelming majority of teaching time in schools. Individual schools should have greater freedom to construct their own programmes of study in subjects outside the national curriculum and develop approaches to learning and study that complement it. The new national curriculum will be developed in line with the coalition government’s stated principles of freedom, responsibility and fairness - to raise standards for all children. The national curriculum should have the following aims at its heart: to embody rigour and high standards and create coherence in what is taught in schools to ensure all children have the opportunity to acquire a core of essential knowledge in the key subject disciplines beyond that core, to allow teachers the freedom to use their professionalism and expertise to help all children realise their potential The national curriculum will continue to be a statutory requirement for maintained schools but will also retain its importance as a national benchmark of excellence for all schools, providing parents with an understanding of what their child should be expected to know at every stage in their school career. The work of the review will be managed by the Department for Education and will report to the Secretary of State for Education, who has statutory responsibility for the national curriculum. The Secretary of State has appointed an advisory committee to guide the review and help frame recommendations, which will be chaired by the Director-General for Education Standards in the Department. The Secretary of State has also asked Mr Tim Oates to lead an expert panel that will provide an evidence base for the review and ensure the construction and content of the new national curriculum is based in evidence and informed by international best practice. The principal objectives for the review are to give teachers greater professional freedom over how they organise and teach the curriculum develop a national curriculum that acts as a benchmark for all schools and provides young people with the knowledge they need to move confidently and successfully through their education, taking into account the needs of different groups including the most able and pupils with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) ensure the content of our national curriculum compares favourably with the most successful international curricula in the highest performing jurisdictions, reflecting the best collective wisdom we have about how children learn and what they should know set rigorous requirements for pupil attainment that measure up to those in the highest performing jurisdictions in the world enable parents to understand what their children should be learning throughout their school career and therefore to support their education The review will also take into account the emerging conclusions of the review of the early years foundation stage (EYFS), to ensure a smooth transition from the EYFS to key stage 1. The government’s ambition is to reduce unnecessary prescription, bureaucracy and central control throughout the education system. That means taking a new approach to the curriculum. The national curriculum should set out only the essential knowledge all children should acquire and leave teachers to decide how to teach this most effectively and to design a wider school curriculum that best meets the needs of their pupils. To too great an extent, the national curriculum has been over-prescriptive, has included material that is not essential, and has specified teaching method rather than content. The government envisages schools and teachers taking greater control over what is taught in schools and how it is taught, using their professional skills and experience to provide the best educational experience for all of their pupils. To bring the curriculum to life, teachers need the space to create lessons that engage their pupils, and children need the time to develop their ability to understand, retain and apply what they have learned. The new national curriculum will, therefore, have a greater focus on subject content, outlining the essential knowledge and understanding that pupils should be expected to have to enable them to take their place as educated members of society. It should embody our cultural and scientific inheritance; the best our past and present generations have to pass on to the next. The national curriculum must not, however, attempt to cover every conceivable area of human knowledge or endeavour, and should not become a vehicle for imposing passing political fads on our children or dominate the school curriculum time in its entirety. As noted in paragraph 2, it is essential to distinguish between the national curriculum and the wider school curriculum. There are a number of important components of a broad and balanced school curriculum for which, as is currently the case, it would be inappropriate to prescribe national programmes of study. This applies, for example, in the case of religious education (RE), where what is taught needs to reflect local circumstances. Religious education will not, therefore, be considered as part of the review of the national curriculum. The government does not intend to make any changes to the statutory basis for religious education. Similar considerations apply to PSHE (personal, social, health and economic) education. The government recognises good PSHE education supports individual young people to make safe and informed choices but that often schools need more support and help in the way they cover the important topics dealt with within PSHE education, including sex and relationships education. The recently published schools white paper, ‘The Importance of Teaching’, announced the government’s intention to conduct a separate internal review to determine how schools can be supported to improve the quality of PSHE teaching, including giving teachers the flexibility to use their judgement about how best to deliver PSHE. The review will consider all subjects that are currently part of the national curriculum: art and design citizenship design and technology English geography history information and communication technology (ICT) mathematics modern foreign languages (MFL) music physical education (PE) science The review will take place in two phases. The core subjects of English, mathematics and science will remain subjects within the national curriculum, with statutory programmes of study from key stage 1 to key stage 4. The first phase of the review will therefore consider the essential knowledge (e.g. facts, concepts, principles and fundamental operations) children need to be taught in order to progress and develop their understanding in these subjects, and draft new programmes of study with a view to them being taught in maintained schools from September 2013. Children need access to high quality physical education. Physical education will, therefore, also remain a compulsory part of the national curriculum at all 4 key stages and the first phase of the review will advise ministers on a much simplified and less prescriptive programme of study. This is also for introduction in 2013. It is proposed the revised curriculum for physical education will set out a clearer expectation that all pupils should play competitive sport, and will retain the expectation that all children learn to swim. The government will also consider whether there would be merit in providing some form of guidance to schools about the allocation of time to outdoor physical activities. These considerations will be informed by the outcomes of the review. The first phase of the review will also consider whether each of the remaining subjects listed in paragraph 13 above should be part of the national curriculum, with statutory programmes of study, and if so, at which key stages. For any subjects that are not recommended to be national curriculum subjects in the future, the review will advise on whether there should be non-statutory programmes of study available at particular key stages, and/or whether those subjects - or any aspects of them - should nevertheless be compulsory but with what is taught being decided at local level. The second phase of the review, starting in early 2012, will produce draft programmes of study for all other subjects in addition to English, mathematics, science and physical education, which the government decides should be part of the national curriculum in future or, where it is decided there should be a non-statutory programme of study, with a view to them being taught in maintained schools from September 2014. The review will also provide advice on the following: the extent to which the content of the national curriculum should be set out on a year-by-year basis, to ensure knowledge is built systematically and consistently what, if anything, should replace existing attainment targets and level descriptors to better define the standards of attainment children should reach, and be assessed against, at various points throughout their education what is needed to provide expectations for progression to support the least able and stretch the most able how the national curriculum can support the provision of more helpful advice and information to parents on their child’s progress how the content of the national curriculum can support the embedding of equality and inclusion. The national curriculum will continue to inform the design and content of assessment at the end of key stage 2. The review itself will not provide advice on how the statutory testing and assessment arrangements should operate. Instead, the government has asked Lord Bew to conduct an independent review of the effectiveness of the current key stage 2 tests. The review will consider how to deliver rigorous, valid and reliable assessments that promote attainment and progression and ensure schools are properly accountable to pupils, parents and the public for the achievement of every child. It will also consider how to ensure assessments provide parents with good quality information on their child’s progress. Lord Bew will make his final recommendations to ministers in June 2011. The national curriculum review will link to Lord Bew’s review, to ensure the standards and expectations set for pupil attainment measure up to those of the highest performing jurisdictions in the world. The national curriculum will continue to inform the design and content of GCSEs. Requirements in the national curriculum should be capable of being embodied readily into GCSE subject criteria and support the effective operation of public examinations at the end of compulsory schooling. The development of new GCSE criteria themselves is outside the scope of this review. The successful development and implementation of the new national curriculum will require commitment from schools and teaching professionals. The review will advise ministers on: how introduction of the new programmes of study in each subject should be phased in what kind of support the school workforce will need to implement the new national curriculum effectively, taking account, in particular, of the implications of introducing new programmes of study in some subjects in 2013 and others in 2014, and what issues need to be considered in relation to related policy areas such as assessment, accountability and inspection, to ensure all aspects of the education system are coherent and aligned behind the new national curriculum. The review will run from 20 January 2011 and will be conducted in two phases. As explained above, the first phase of the review will focus on the overall shape and nature of the national curriculum, including which subjects beyond English, mathematics, science and physical education should have statutory or non-statutory programmes of study in the future cross-cutting issues including the support needed by schools to enable effective implementation the development of new programmes of study in English, mathematics, science and physical education Recommendations from phase 1, including draft programmes of study, will be provided to ministers for consideration by autumn 2011, and there will be a public consultation on the draft programmes of study in early 2012. The second phase will focus on the development of statutory and non-statutory programmes of study, as appropriate, in relation to all other subjects where it is decided at the conclusion of phase 1 that programmes of study are needed in the future. This second phase of work will begin early in 2012, with recommendations including draft programmes of study to be provided to ministers for consideration by autumn 2012. There will be a public consultation on the draft programmes of study in early 2013. The intention is that the new programmes of study for English, mathematics, science and physical education will be prepared and available to schools by September 2012, with teaching in maintained schools to commence from September 2013. New programmes of study for all other subjects that are either to form part of the new national curriculum or to have non-statutory programmes of study will be available to schools by September 2013, with teaching in maintained schools to commence from September 2014. The advisory committee will support the Department for Education in the conduct of the review by helping to frame recommendations, offering a wider perspective on the proposals from the expert panel and providing advice on strategic and cross-cutting issues that may arise from the review. The committee will consist of the following members: Jon Coles, Chair of the advisory committee (Director-General for Education Standards, Department for Education) Tim Oates (Chair of the expert panel and Director of Assessment Research and Development, Cambridge Assessment) Shahed Ahmed (Head of Elmhurst Primary School, Forest Gate) Peter Barnes (Head of Oakgrove School, Milton Keynes) Dame Yasmin Bevan (Executive Principal and Head of Denbigh High School and Challney High School for Boys, Luton) Mike Harris (Head of Education and Skills Policy at the Institute of Directors) Patrick Leeson (Director of Education and Care, Ofsted) John D. F. Martin (Head of Castle Hill Junior School, Basingstoke) Bernice McCabe (Head of North London Collegiate) John McIntosh OBE (retired Head of the London Oratory School) Ruth Miskin (Founder, Read Write Inc and former Primary Head) Joe Prendergast (Head of Wennington Hall School, Lancaster) Heather Rockhold (retired Head of Lauriston Primary School, Hackney) Professor Nigel Thrift (Vice-Chancellor, University of Warwick) Sir Michael Wilshaw (Head of Mossbourne Community Academy, Hackney, and Director of Education at ARK) The expert panel will lead on the construction and content of the new national curriculum. The panel will develop a robust evidence base to inform the drafting of new programmes of study, and build a detailed framework for the national curriculum taking account of the requirements set by the highest performing international jurisdictions. It will also reflect the views of teachers, subject communities, academics, employers, higher education institutions and other interested parties. The expert panel will consist of the following members: Tim Oates, Chair of the Expert Panel (Director of Assessment Research and Development, Cambridge Assessment) Professor Mary James (Associate Director of Research in the Faculty of Education, University of Cambridge) Professor Andrew Pollard (Professor of Education at the Department of Quantitative Social Science, Institute of Education, and Director of ESCalate at the Graduate School of Education, University of Bristol) Professor Dylan Wiliam (formerly a Deputy Director at the Institute of Education and Professor of Educational Assessment) A secretariat for the review and a research team to support the expert panel will be provided by the Department for Education. The review will be open, transparent and outward-facing. A Call for Evidence has been launched, inviting all interested parties to contribute to the review and the development of the new national curriculum. A further Call for Evidence will be issued in early 2012 for phase 2 of the review. The Department for Education will organise a series of consultation events for key stakeholders and work to ensure headteachers, classroom teachers, parents and others are able to contribute to the work of developing the new national curriculum. Regular updates on the progress of the review will be provided via the Department for Education’s website. Read further information about the review .

/government/news/over-96000-people-contact-adoption-information-service-in-12-months,"More than 96,000 people interested in giving a vulnerable child a stable, loving home have contacted First4Adoption in just 12 months - an average of 327 new contacts every day. First4Adoption, the government-funded information service, was set up to help address the serious shortage of adopters, which contributes to delays in finding loving homes for children. It provides clear and impartial advice about adopting and helps put people in touch with local adoption agencies. Since first opening its doors for business in April 2013: 94,752 people have visited the First4Adoption website and over 2,000 people have called the dedicated information line of the 96,000 people who contacted the service, over 6,800 went on to directly contact an adoption agency of their choice - taking the vital next step in becoming an adoptive parent use of the online service has grown rapidly from around 5,600 visits a month in April 2013, when it was launched, to over 27,000 in December 2013 Today’s figures build on the successes of 2013, which saw a 34% increase in adopters and a record 15% rise in adoptions. The government has today also announced the appointment of Sir Martin Narey as the Chair of the Adoption Leadership Board - a new national initiative jointly developed by government, councils and voluntary adoption agencies - to drive improvements in the adoption system and ensure there are enough adopters to provide homes for all the children who are waiting to be adopted. Children and Families Minister Edward Timpson, who grew up with 2 adopted brothers, said: Adopting a child is one of the most challenging but rewarding decisions a person can make. It is fantastic news that after just 12 months more than 96,000 people have reached out to this vital service. However, we know there is still a shortage of adopters and that work needs to be done to ensure the 6,000 children who need a safe and caring home are placed more quickly. That is why our new Adoption Leadership Board - headed up by Sir Martin Narey - will play an important role in ensuring that not only local authorities and adoption agencies stay on track, but that we do what we can to improve the system and recruit even more adopters than ever before. The board has a key role to play in providing independent advice to ministers, and is made up of senior members from key adoption organisations, including the Association of Directors of Children’s Services, the Local Government Association, the Consortium of Voluntary Adoption Agencies, BAAF and Adoption UK. Sir Martin Narey, newly appointed Chair of the Adoption Leadership Board, said: Ensuring we find adoptive homes for all the children in care who, generally because of the neglect they have suffered at home, can never return to their birth parents, has been a passion for me for some years. I am delighted to see that many of the recommendations I made to ministers in 2012 about adoption and siblings, adoption and contact, fostering before adoption, and ethnicity and adoption matching have now found themselves in law as part of the new Children and Families Act. But there is still much more to be done before every child in England who needs the love and permanence that adoption brings finds an adoptive home speedily. And there is a great deal more needed to ensure that adoptive parents receive all the support that is necessary to ensure that their adoption succeeds. Research published last year by the Department for Education shows that there could be up to 4 million people in England likely to consider adopting at some point in the future, yet up and down the country there are still 6,000 children waiting to be adopted. The First4Adoption information service is just one of a comprehensive package of government reforms to overhaul the adoption system with the aim of recruiting more adopters and placing vulnerable children with a stable, loving home more quickly. We have introduced the £19 million adoption support fund to help adoptive families access the tailored, specialist support they need, and have extended the entitlements that children in care have, so that these continue once the child has been adopted. This includes access to priority school admissions, the pupil premium and, from September 2014, eligibility for free early education for 2-year-olds. We have given adopters new resources, including the adoption passport, which sets out their rights and entitlements as adoptive parents, and the new clickable online adoption maps, which allow potential adopters to find out more information about what’s in their area. The adoption reform grant has now been extended into 2014 - providing £50 million to councils to support them in implementing the changes in the Children and Families Act. We have also introduced a faster approval process so the majority of people are approved within 6 months, and introduced new rules so prospective adopters and children are placed on the adoption register within 3 months. Notes to editors First4Adoption is the dedicated information service for people interested in adopting a child in England http://www.first4adoption.org.uk/ or 0300 222 0022 Sir Martin Narey was Director General of the Prison Service of England and Wales between 1998 and 2003 before becoming the first Chief Executive of the National Offender Management Service and a Second Permanent Secretary at the Home Office. In 2005 he left the civil service to become a Chief Executive of Barnardo’s before stepping down in January 2011. At Barnardo’s he led the charity through a period of substantially increased political impact and made it, once again, the UK’s biggest children’s charity. He is a Visiting Professor at Durham and Sheffield Hallam Universities, Chair of The Portman Group and a Board Member of the Advertising Standards Authority. From 2011 to 2013 he was the government’s advisor on adoption. His recommendations from an independent report commissioned by The Times provided the core of the adoption reform programme which has been so successful.In February 2013 he took on a wider role, advising the Secretary of State for Education on children’s social care. He has undertaken a review into the quality of initial training for child and family social workers. Dr Carol Homden CBE, of First4Adoption, said: Since its launch a year ago, First4Adoption has received 96,000 enquiries from people interested in adoption, which shows the level of interest out there. This is very encouraging, but this is just the beginning. With local authorities and voluntary adoption agencies, we must redouble our efforts to ensure that those people who are willing and able to become adopters receive the right preparation and support to do so. The appointment of Sir Martin Narey as Chairman of the Adoption Leadership Board signals the intent of the sector to rise to the challenge to give the growing number of children in care a loving, stable and permanent home. Hugh Thornbery, CEO at Adoption UK, said: > We welcome the appointment of Sir Martin Narey as independent chair of the Adoption Leadership Board. His knowledge of the adoption system and the challenges we all face to find and support families for children waiting to be adopted will be of invaluable benefit. Good progress is being made with the reforms, with more to come, and it is very encouraging that nearly 100,000 people have contacted First 4 Adoption to find out more about adoption. [Contact:997]"

/government/speeches/sam-gyimah-we-are-in-a-golden-age-of-childcare,"Good morning and thank you for that kind introduction. It’s a pleasure to be here today at my second Nursery World Business Summit. The last time I addressed a Nursery World conference was towards the end of the last Parliament. And I’m delighted to be back as Childcare Minister and a full-time minister in the Department for Education. Not only because of the importance of making sure children have the best start in life. But because government has recognised that childcare is the issue for many parents. As a minister, having responsibility for an area with investment is really exciting. And today I want to set out our priorities for the delivery of 30 hours of free childcare and beyond. I know how important childcare is from my personal experiences. I was brought up by a single mother, at one point, looking after 3 children under the age of 6. She instilled in me the importance of early education to get on in life. But also as the oldest, there were times that I was helping with childcare. And now, I’m living in a family with a young son where both parents work, facing the same challenge that all working families face - the struggle to find flexible childcare. Dreading that call from the nursery to say that he has got a temperature and having to speak to my wife about who will pick him up. I know what it’s like from the point of view of a working parent. But no one size fits all. I couldn’t be more determined to make sure we give children the best start in life, support parents to work, and as a result allow our country to prosper. Achievements so far I think we have already come a long way since I was last here. Nearly 60% of children eligible for the 2-year-old free entitlement were accessing a place in January this year, 4 months after the entitlement was extended. Alongside this, the sector is innovating. Take the Swindon 2 to 19 Academy, where the entitlement is being offered over the weekend to support parents’ working hours, thanks to a partnership between the school and a private provider. We have invested over £50 million in the early years pupil premium, to further help disadvantaged children in the early years. Tax-Free Childcare will be rolled out in 2017. We have supported parents by commissioning the ‘ What to expect when ’ guide. The literacy strategy which the Secretary of State launched in September has a strong focus on the early years. And the Childcare Implementation Taskforce, which I co-chair, is bringing together all the different childcare policies that sit across government to make the system simpler for parents and providers. Our commitment to childcare is made clearer nowhere else than in the Childcare Bill , currently working its way through Parliament, which we introduced to double the existing entitlement for 3- and 4-year-olds of working parents from 15 to 30 hours. This will represent a huge change in the market, with government becoming a bigger buyer of childcare than ever before. I want to make sure that we support you as providers - in terms of funding, regulation and the workforce - so that you can use this opportunity to deliver what parents want and thrive as a sector. I am pleased that when government budgets are being cut across Whitehall, that this government has made a strategic decision to invest in childcare. Making childcare work for parents and children The online survey we carried out over the summer and the employee events hosted at large employers like Rolls Royce, John Lewis and BT were incredibly useful for developing our policies. And what we have heard from the 19,000 who responded to the survey and those who came to the events is that they are looking for convenience and flexibility, quality, and in the longer term, a simpler childcare system. For parents, my ambition is to deliver these objectives and to support a system where high-quality childcare is accessible, flexible and affordable. And I think we’re starting off from a strong position, given the current performance of the sector. The childcare debate has moved on from whether or not Sure Start centres should offer childcare, to how we offer childcare places that are high quality and work for parents. I believe the sector can rise to the challenge and deliver. Despite the doom-mongers, the 2015 LaingBuisson nursery market report estimated that the UK children’s daycare market was worth £4.9 billion in the 2013 to 2014 financial year - a year-on-year, real-terms increase of 4.1%. There are more registered places in full daycare settings, and more places in the most deprived areas. The qualification levels of staff have been rising: the most recent NDNA survey found that 88% of settings surveyed employed a graduate. The outcomes are positive too: 94% of 3-year-olds and 99% of 4-year-olds take up the current free entitlement at March 2015, 85% of providers on the Early Years Register were rated ‘good’ or ‘outstanding’ for overall effectiveness and ratings for providers in the most deprived areas have improved from 59% ‘good’ or ‘outstanding’ in 2010 to 78% ‘good’ or ‘outstanding’ in 2015. That’s an incredible increase EYFSP results are the best ever. This year, 66% of children achieved a good level of development compared to 52% in 2013. And the gap between the lowest attaining 20% achieving a good level of development and the rest has continued to narrow I know there will be challenges in delivering the 30 hours. But I am certain that they can be overcome, and that alongside them you will be able to build on the above successes and make the most of the opportunities. Opportunities brought about by the 600,000 families who will benefit from the 30 hours, some of whom are considering childcare for the first time and others who are considering more childcare. And the increase in the overall spend on childcare across government, rising from £5 billion to more than £6 billion a year over this Parliament, which through Tax-Free Childcare and tax credits means greater spending power for parents. Progress with the 30 hours pledge In October we published a policy statement which reflects much of the progress we have made with the 30 hours pledge so far. It sets out the terms of eligibility for the entitlement. It makes it clear that parents who are self-employed and lone parents get the 30 hours. Grace periods will support those who are away from the labour market temporarily to ensure continuity and limit disruption for children and providers. It shares the key next steps towards full implementation of the entitlement from 2017 and early implementation in some areas in 2016. I’m told 1,800 local authorities and providers have already come forward to register their interest to take part in the Early Implementers programme. I can’t emphasise enough how important this is, as through implementation we will test capacity, flexibility and innovation, as well as ensure that all eligible children, including those with special educational needs, can access the 30 hours. As part of the early implementers, and to help inform them, we want to hear about partnership working between schools and providers to deliver flexible, full-day early years provision - the type that parents often need and which we want to encourage, especially to deliver the extra capacity we will need across the system. I mentioned the example of Swindon Academy earlier and I know there are others out there - from Plymouth to Blackburn - so please come forward to share your experience with us if you haven’t done so already. Providers’ concerns I know from the call for evidence and the subsequent meetings we held that in the sector you have a range of concerns with the 30 hours offer. I want to be clear that the government is listening to these concerns. And that we will do what we can to address them. You told us that dealing with multiple local authorities, which have different requirements, can be time consuming. We have already reduced the amount of bureaucracy around the early education entitlements, limiting the conditions that local authorities can place on providers and making it easier for providers to offer places. But we are also looking at what more we could do to make requirements across authorities more consistent across the country. As set out in the policy statement, we will consider whether we can support local authorities in drawing up agreements with providers. And another area I am keen to explore is the ability for providers to form a statutory relationship with one local authority, such as on environmental health or fire safety, that can then be taken into account by other local regulators. For childcare providers, this could mean entering into an agreement with a local authority about food safety and hygiene standards, and using this to support setting up provision in another authority, saving precious time and resource for local authorities and providers alike. You also told us about being more flexible in how you deliver the 30 hours. We think it’s hugely important that the entitlement is made available at times which offer flexibility to parents working outside 9 to 5. And we want to continue encouraging this, for example, through local authorities funding providers to allow parents to access the early entitlement hours between 7am and 7pm, resulting in greater flexibility over drop off and pick up times. Something which I know all too well myself can be a challenge. And you shared your concerns about attracting, retaining and promoting talent, which I will come back to later, when I talk about my ambitions for the workforce more widely. Funding Another of your key concerns has been funding. I understand the importance of a sustainable rate of funding to deliver the entitlement, which is why we have undertaken a review of the costs of childcare. This is the first time the department has undertaken a review like this. I also understand the way the local authority top slice works and how that leads to variation in rates across local areas, and that funding differs depending on what type of provider you are. We have been clear on funding - and the Prime Minister himself has committed to an increase in the average rate paid to providers. The funding review we have been carrying out to understand the costs facing providers will allow us to set a level of funding needed to deliver high-quality childcare provision, while at the same time providing good value to the taxpayer. The review has been going on for 6 months. The results will be part of the 25 November Autumn Statement , which the Chancellor will be delivering for the whole government. I know you will want me to say more today, but I’m afraid I can’t say more than that. What I can say is that we have drawn on a significant body of evidence, including more than 2,000 responses to our call for evidence on providers’ costs, as well as roundtables to consider in detail some of the issues raised in the call for evidence. And we’ve also had Deloitte, an independent organisation, involved. Engaging with stakeholders has been a key part of the 30 hours policy development overall. I have already mentioned the survey and events with parents, but we are also planning events to engage with childminders, who are uniquely positioned to play an important role in the delivery of the 30 hours. And we have held productive discussions with unions, including NAHT , ASCL , ATL , NUT , NASUWT and VOICE. Thank you to all of you who have engaged with us so far - and I hope you will continue to do so as the policy progresses. Supporting parents as consumers Supporting parents with their childcare choices also matters to us. During the report stage of the Childcare Bill, we committed to producing a guide for parents to help them understand what quality looks like and helpful questions they can ask when choosing suitable childcare. We also know that this is the 21st century and earlier this year we launched a competition for a digital solution to help parents with childcare decisions . Childcare.co.uk won this competition and I am looking forward to seeing how their app will offer information, advice and assistance to parents when it goes live at the end of November. To make sure more childcare places are available for parents we also want to support providers with investment, and in March we launched the childcare investment readiness fund. This will help to generate a new culture of social investment in the early years market, supporting providers, who want to expand, to grow. Groups such as LEYF in London have already effectively leveraged social investment and we want these success stories to be more widespread. We will shortly be announcing the winning applicants to the fund, and I am excited to showcase their innovation and dedication to expanding high-quality early years provision across the country. Quality As the Childcare Bill has been going through Parliament, we have made an important commitment to retain the current ratios. And I am clear that we currently have no plans to alter ratios in the delivery of the 30 hours. But, we need to face up to something: that ratios are not the only hallmark of quality in early years settings. When I speak to providers and ask about this, they list a long line of quality hallmarks. So I would say it is time to stop using them as a stick with which to beat us in government and to focus on the other factors needed to deliver and improve quality. You make decisions about how you run your business. Operating at the minimum ratios can make a big difference for you and your business in terms of what you can do to reinvest. By maximising ratios, some providers are able to free up resources to invest back in their businesses and improve quality. I would like to see more of this. A number of you have also said to me privately that while you are comfortable with the existing ratios for 3- and 4 year-olds, you would like to see some more flexibility, for example with different ratios at different times of the day, or when staff are away from work sick. I want you to know that if there are things we can do to help you better organise your workforce, then I am here and willing to listen. Continuing reform of the workforce Because the workforce is the biggest asset in the childcare sector, having the right people with the right skills and being able to deploy them in the best ways will make a huge difference to outcomes. It was when I visited the OECD in Paris, that they said said, ‘Staff qualifications are one of the strongest predictors of the quality of early childhood education and care.’ We have invested over £10 million in projects to raise quality and support staff development, including £5.3 million through the voluntary and community sector grants programme and the £5 million fund we announced last year for teaching schools to work with providers in schools and the PVI sector to drive up quality. One year on, we are seeing great results, especially in disadvantaged areas. New River TSA in London has set up a strategic partnership between nursery schools, Middlesex University and the local authority, targeting private nurseries with the most disadvantaged children on roll. They provide opportunities for staff in these nurseries to train for qualifications at levels 2, 3 and 4, which are accredited by Middlesex University. Then there’s East London Early Years and Schools Partnership, which is bringing together primary schools and private nurseries to develop a co-ordinated approach for the early identification of SEN , and a common approach to the transition to school. Workforce strategy I shared the finding from the latest NDNA survey earlier that 88% of settings they surveyed employed a graduate. We also know that 97% of staff in the sector already have a level 3 qualification. But I recognise that there is further to go to address the remaining workforce challenges, especially around progression, for example supporting those at level 2 to progress to level 3. And I am committed to achieving more. I want young people to consider the early years as a career of choice and a sector in which they can pursue a long-term career full of potential. I want those already working in the sector to have the opportunity to enhance their skills and to pursue the qualifications that enable them to progress. My vision is that someone joining the workforce as an unqualified member of staff, with the right aptitude to work with children and the potential to achieve the necessary qualifications, can work their way up through the system to become an early years educator, an early years teacher, a centre manager, a manager of a chain, or perhaps an entrepreneur establishing their own childcare business. It will take time to achieve this, I know, but we should not forget the reforms we have already secured to improve what used to be a fractured and complicated qualifications system. Early years initial teacher training provides opportunities for some of our highest quality graduates to specialise in the 0 to 5 age range. The introduction of the level 3 early years educator criteria has ensured that training provides a solid grounding in child development and support for children’s learning at the most critical stage of their lives. Employers tell me that our decision to enable trainees to take GCSE English and maths alongside their EYE training is helping more and more staff to access level 3. What more can we do? One of the government’s key commitments is to increase the number of apprenticeship starts to 3 million in this Parliament. These high-quality, paid training routes give apprentices a strong foundation for a successful career. In return, organisations benefit from an apprentice whose knowledge and skills they can tailor to meet their business needs. I want the early years sector to benefit too, and I want potential apprentices to see the early years as a destination of choice. Our own provider survey conducted every 2 years tells us that in 2013 there were 13,500 apprentices employed in full-day care settings. That’s equivalent to 6% of all staff in full-day care settings. I am committed to the DfE working with colleagues at BIS and through the trailblazer group to develop the new level 3 early years educator apprenticeship standard, and I hope that we could build on this in future to put in place a clear career path for apprentices. Alongside this I want to engage the sector in exploring how we can create a career structure for all staff, not just those going down the apprenticeship route. I want to develop a workforce strategy that will enable staff to reach their potential and forge a successful career in the early years. And this is one of my key priorities going forward. As I started by saying, it’s an exciting time to be childcare minister and an exciting time to be involved in the childcare sector. I genuinely believe that we are in a golden age of childcare in this country. You all work extremely hard to deliver the priorities we want for young children and their parents, and whenever I visit nurseries or day care settings I am hugely impressed by your commitment and dedication. I wasn’t able to attend the recent Nursery World awards, but I know it was a celebration of some of the best practice taking place across the sector. I look forward to seeing more of this in the future, and to working with all of you to make childcare work for children and parents."
/government/news/new-maths-hubs-to-raise-standards,"Education Minister Elizabeth Truss today announced £11 million for new maths hubs to drive up the quality of maths teachers - as international test results showed England’s performance had stagnated. The money will allow the development of a national network of around 30 ‘mathematics education strategic hubs’ ( MESH ). Each will be led by a teaching school and will provide support to all schools in the area, across all areas of maths education, including: recruitment of maths specialists into teaching initial training of maths teachers and converting existing teachers into maths co-ordinating and delivering a wide range of maths continuing professional development (CPD) and school-to-school support ensuring maths leadership is developed, eg running a programme for aspiring heads of maths departments helping maths enrichment programmes to reach a large number of pupils from primary school onwards Other teaching school alliances and school and college groupings in the area will be strategic partners in the hub. The expectation will be that all phases of education from early years to post-16 will be represented. The Programme for International Student Assessment ( PISA ) tests this year focused on maths, with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) comparing countries’ average performance in the subject with England’s. The PISA tests show that England’s performance has stagnated in maths and we are now ranked 25th. England’s score in maths is now 495, compared to 493 in 2009 and 495 in 2006. The OECD said England’s performance had plateaued in the last 6 years with 1 in 12 of England’s 15-year-olds failing even to reach the most basic level. The table is dominated by jurisdictions from south-east Asia - the top 7 in maths are Shanghai-China, Singapore, Hong Kong-China, Chinese Taipei, Korea, Macao-China and Japan. Vietnam is now ranked ahead of England, at 17th. The performance of all these jurisdictions is rated by the OECD as ‘significantly’ better than England’s. Notes to editors Further information on hubs Hubs will develop local specialist expertise by including local university faculties, area representatives of national initiatives (such as the Further Mathematics Support Programme and the Core Maths Support Programme), subject associations and appropriate local employers. National co-ordination will be provided by the National Centre for Excellence in the Teaching of Mathematics ( NCETM ) which has already tested the approach, working with several leading teaching schools. The aim of the national network of MESH will be to ensure that all schools have access to support. The network will also ensure that all the support provided by MESH is grounded in evidence about what works, both in terms of mathematics teaching and the development of teachers of mathematics. The network will bring together the emerging national leaders of mathematics education and aim to make school-led national subject improvement a reality. This specialist support complements the more general workforce development and school improvement led by teaching school alliances and will initially focus on the implementation of the new national curriculum mathematics curriculum from 2014 to 2015, and the new mathematics GCSEs from 2015 to 2016. The NCETM have established 5 pathfinder MESH which are already demonstrating how well placed certain teaching schools are to provide strategic leadership. Also evident is the strong commitment from a diverse range of partners to pool their expertise in a collective effort to support schools in mathematics education. The main programme will be robustly evaluated, and if it proves successful in raising the standards of mathematics teaching it may be continued in 2016 to 2017, contingent on future spending review outcomes. Maths reforms The Department for Education has already launched a top-to-bottom overhaul of maths in schools in England to address the issues, which include: Only a fifth of pupils in England study maths at any level after GCSEs - the lowest rate of 24 developed countries, behind Estonia, France, USA, Spain, Russia and China, according to a 2010 report by the Nuffield Foundation. In Japan, approximately 85% of young people study maths to the equivalent of A level. In Chinese Taipei, South Korea and Hong Kong - examples of high-performing countries - maths is compulsory in ‘upper secondary’ (16 to 19) education. Most students who do carry on with maths in England to a higher level are A-grade students - 71% of those who got an A* or A in GCSE maths in 2012 studied maths post-16. But almost all other pupils drop the subject after GCSE because of the lack of appropriate maths courses for them to take - only 33% of students who got a B, and just 24% of those with a C, studied any maths post-16, often at a level below GCSE . The amount of time spent teaching maths in England is also low - we are 39th out of 42 countries, with 116 hours a year spent teaching maths at age 14. This compares with 166 hours a year spent teaching maths in Chinese Taipei, 138 hours in Singapore, 138 hours in Hong Kong and 137 hours in South Korea - some of the highest-performing education jurisdictions ( TIMSS 2011). Alongside low participation, international tables show that England’s performance in maths has stagnated at ages 10, 14 and 15, while 30% of businesses in the Confederation of British Industry’s (CBI) education and skills survey last year reported dissatisfaction with the standard of school and college leavers’ numeracy. Some 68% of employers said they wanted both maths and science promoted more in schools. The reforms include: A rigorous curriculum that focuses on the basics in primary so pupils can progress and achieve greater success at secondary. There is increased challenge in primary school maths with more demanding concepts (eg calculations of fractions, volume and area) introduced earlier. Children will be expected to know their 12x12 times table by age 9. Secondary school pupils will learn about rates of change, probability and algebra. Calculators banned from tests for 11-year-olds. Tough new GCSEs that are more demanding than current exams. We are involving our top universities in developing new maths A levels and are funding Cambridge University to develop an advanced maths curriculum for A level students so they are ready for rigorous degree courses. We have introduced new specialist maths free schools. From this month all students who do not get a grade C in maths GCSE will carry on studying the subject until they do achieve that qualification. We are providing the highest level of bursaries for the best maths graduates to train to teach. New core maths qualifications for 16- to 18-year-olds will be introduced, in particular for students who get a B or C at GCSE and consider A level maths too challenging. [Contact:997]"

/government/news/prime-minister-announces-support-for-families--2,"Exciting new services to give mums and dads the support they need to do the best for their children were launched today by the Prime Minister. The care and attention a child receives when young will affect their health, behaviour and ability to learn throughout their lives. A recent survey suggests that 85 per cent of mums and dads want more practical help on caring for their baby to provide the best possible start for their children. The Prime Minister outlined that the support being offered to parents will include: a brand new digital service for parents-to-be and new parents, providing regular emails and texts with timely information as their pregnancy develops and their child grows; free parenting classes to all parents of children aged five years and under in three trial areas; expert organisations to deliver relationship support for first time parents in four trial areas of the country from this summer. Digital service for parents-to-be and new parents From today, the NHS Information Service for Parents will give mums and dads advice they can trust covering a wide range of issues related to staying healthy in pregnancy, preparing for birth and looking after their baby. Those signing up to the service will no longer be faced with information overload while surfing the internet, but will have relevant, timely NHS approved advice sent directly to their phones and inboxes. This includes links to specially commissioned videos showing midwives demonstrating practical advice such as bathing your baby and parents discussing issues that affected them and how they supported each other. Prime Minister David Cameron said: Parents are nation-builders. It’s through love and sheer hard work that we raise the next generation with the right values. That’s why this Government is doing everything possible to support parents. We’re doing the big, long-term things to make this country stronger for our children - dealing with our debts; having a massive push for better schools; working to create more good, skilled jobs in our economy. But we’re also focussed on making life easier for parents day-to-day, from extending childcare to increasing the number of health visitors. The parenting classes and films we’re launching this week are an important part of that, providing clear, professionally-led advice on everything from teething to tantrums. Secretary of State for Health, Andrew Lansley said: We all want to give our children the best start in life. But sometimes, particularly for first-time parents, bringing a new baby home can be a daunting as well as a happy experience. That is why we are determined to help people become more confident in becoming a parent - from pregnancy to the start of their children’s lives. From now on, this new information service will be at parents’ sides to support them in the first stage of their child’s journey, guiding them with relevant information and first-hand experience from other parents. Cathy Warwick, Chief Executive of the President of the Royal College of Midwives, welcomed the new service: We warmly welcome this innovative online and multi-media service for parents. We hope that the email and text alerts will bolster the work that midwives do with women and their families by providing additional information that will empower and signpost parents to further appropriate sources of support and help. We know that pregnancy and maternity care are in many cases the first time most parents will interact with the health service and this presents a unique opportunity to provide health promoting messages to families. This is why good quality information, which this service promotes, during pregnancy, birth and the post-natal period can have a significant long-term impact on the health and well-being of mothers and babies. Free parenting classes This service is announced alongside free parenting classes to all parents of children aged five years and under in three trial areas - Middlesbrough, High Peak in Derbyshire and Camden in London. Mums and dads will be able to use vouchers, available from Boots stores, children’s centres, health visitors and professionals who have contact with families to pay for the classes. The NCT, Coram, Save the Children, and the Fatherhood Institute are among those who are delivering classes. Children’s Minister Sarah Teather said: All parents want the best for their children and we want to help them. Most parents go to ante-natal classes before their child is born and the benefits of these are well-documented. We want mums and dads to be able to access similar help and advice in the earliest years of their child’s life and for this to be a normal part of family life. The trial will help Government understand how classes could be made available to every mum and dad. Decisions on national roll out will be informed by the independent evaluation. Mary Rose Brady, Head of Coram’s Parents’ Centre said: Parents tell us, no one gives you a manual when you have kids - so here’s our manual. Each session that Coram is delivering is based on what years of evidence show will best support children in their early development. Parents are the experts in their own children, but everyone can benefit from understanding the key ingredients. Sally Copley, Save the Children’s Head of Poverty, said: Giving parents extra support shouldn’t stop at ante-natal classes. Children’s early years are a crucial time and providing parents with help and advice throughout can only enhance what they are doing already. The success of our programme FAST, that helps parents to engage with their child’s early learning, are proof of the demand for high quality parenting support. We hope that once proven successful these schemes will be available to all children in the UK. All mothers and fathers in the trial areas will be entitled to a voucher covering the cost of a course of parenting classes. Vouchers are being distributed by professionals working in the early years (for example nurseries, children’s centres, midwives, health visitors) and by pharmacy-led health and beauty retailer, Boots. The classes are now open for booking in all three trial areas. Up to £5 million has been made available for the trial between March 2012 and March 2014. This includes funding for redemption of parenting class vouchers and an independent evaluation. Relationship support Relate, The Tavistock Centre for Couple Relationships and the Fatherhood Institute will deliver relationship support sessions for first time parents to support them with the transition to parenthood in four areas of the country from this summer. The government wants to support strong and stable families and research shows that the birth of a new child can be a stress point for couples. A trial starting in July will offer subsidised relationship support sessions for all expectant mothers and fathers and those with children up to the age of two in the trial areas - York and Leeds, North Essex, Hackney and City of London, Islington and Westminster. Up to £1 million has been made available for the trial between April 2012 and March 2014. The sessions will be delivered by one of three providers and parents will have the choice of face to face and/or online support. They will be designed to help parents understand that it is normal for their relationship to go through a transition period after they have a child and to give them strategies to work through this as a couple. The trial will be managed and promoted by the National Childbirth Trust (NCT) to encourage couples to feel that it is normal to access relationship support in the first few years of their child’s life - just as they would go to an ante-natal class. The offer will be distributed by professionals working in the early years - for example, from nurseries, children’s centres, midwives and health visitors. Sarah Teather added: Becoming a parent is life changing for mothers and fathers. Although this can be an exiting, joyful time, it is also normal for couples to need extra support at this time and I hope this trial will benefit families. John Loughton, Head of Public Policy Relate, said: Relate is delighted to be working with the Department for Education. Following the birth of a child, evidence shows that issues like coping with tiredness and new parental responsibilities can leave a couple vulnerable to tension, conflict or poor emotional wellbeing. Couples manage best when they work as a team, and Relate, through this trial, can offer the strategies, advice and confidence couples need to thrive as a parent and a partner. Notes to editors The Parental Opinion Survey 2010 (published by DfE Nov 2010) found that 85 per cent of parents with children under three were found to have sought information to help with parenting in the previous year. The survey from the Family and Parenting Institute showed that almost 60 per cent of parents thought they should automatically receive information and the offer of parenting classes. The NSPCC survey shows that almost three quarters (72 per cent) of all new mothers said they would have liked more professional advice before their baby was born. There are 670,000 visits per month to the Pregnancy and Baby content on the NHS Choices site from people searching for information. More evidence around the support for new parents can be found on the Department of Health website. Mums and dads will be able to use vouchers, available from Boots stores, children’s centres, health visitors and professionals who have contact with families to pay for the classes. They can also go to the CANParent website to find local distribution points. Six organisations will deliver the classes in all three areas: NCT Family Links Save the Children Fatherhood Institute Solihull Approach (Heart of England NHS Trust) Race Equality Foundation (with Mumsnet) Providers only in Camden: Montessori St Nicholas The Mind Gym (Parent Gym) Coram City Literary Institute Only in Middlesbrough: Barnardo’s Only in High Peak: Derbyshire Council Family Lives Family Matters Institute The providers are being paid on a delivery basis only - they will have a concession contract which allows them to claim reimbursement for delivering classes to a voucher holding parent. Parents will be invited to sign up to this new service at booking appointments with midwives. They will also see widgets linking them to the sign up page on NHS Choices. The widget will also be available for organisations like Mumsnet, Netmums and the NCT to include on their websites - the new service links to these organisations’ websites as part of the emails sent to parents. They will then receive regular, relevant and tailored information via email or text as their pregnancy develops and their child grows. At launch the new service will be available to parents-to-be and parents with new babies aged up to one month. The content of the service will increase and develop in response to feedback from parents and professionals and as the babies of the parents who have signed up grow. Sign up to this NHS service or find out more information . The sessions will be open for booking from July this year and will be delivered from the end of July. The four areas were chosen in partnership with providers to give a spread of geography and socio-economic characteristics. The providers will be paid on a delivery basis only - they will be offered a concession contract which allows them to claim reimbursement for delivering a session to an eligible parent/couple. The sessions are likely to involve helping first time parents deal with the emotional and relationship changes that they may experience after having a baby, including: managing new roles and responsibilities in your relationship dealing with the emotional impact of having a child learning negotiating and compromising skills balancing your role as a parent and as a partner coping with issues like lack of sleep and mess. The online only sessions will be delivered by the Fatherhood Institute in all the trial areas. Sessions including online and face to face elements will be delivered by Relate in North Essex, York and Leeds and the Tavistock Centre for Couple Relationships in Hackney and City, Islington and Westminster. The trial will be managed and promoted by the NCT. [Contact:997]"

/government/news/voluntary-and-community-organisations-awarded-60-million-grant,"The Department for Education today announced the voluntary organisations that have been successful in their bid for funding from the Department’s Voluntary and Community Sector (VCS) grant worth around £60 million each year. Over the next two years, the VCS organisations awarded grants today will play a significant role in reforming and delivering services for children, young people, parents and families. At the launch of the bidding prospectus for the VCS grant in November 2010, the Government set out criteria to directly fund, at national level, voluntary and community organisations that work with children, young people, parents and families, with a particular emphasis on early intervention and tackling the needs of the most disadvantaged groups. The VCS grant has been allocated according to services offered under specific grant themes, these are: Families and Relationship support Early Years and Childcare Child Protection and Safeguarding Young People Children in Care Special Educational Needs and Disability In addition ‘Strategic Partner’ grants have been established to ensure Government gets advice about issues affecting VCS organisations and to help capacity building of the sector through transition, in particular smaller organisations. The themes for strategic partner grants are Family Services Young People SEN and Disability Early Years and Childcare Overarching Following a competitive process, the successful VCS organisations have been notified of the indicative amount of grant they will receive, which is subject to negotiation, and the service the Government wishes them to deliver. There will be around £6 million available from the £60 million for successful bidders to receive extra help and support to build extra capacity, so that they are in good shape to remain sustainable long after this two year grant comes to an end. The Grant aims to help create a vigorous and responsive sector, freed up from dependency on grant-based funding and better equipped to operate within a payments by results environment organisations which are efficient, effective and sustainable - “commissioning ready” - funded through grants and contracts to provide services for LAs (and others) innovative approaches which will lever in private investment. Through the localism bill, Government is opening up markets to enable the voluntary sector to play a bigger role in delivering key services such as children’s centres and youth services - and we will work with local authorities to ensure that they commission services from the sector. Children’s Minister Tim Loughton said: The Government is committed to supporting voluntary and community sector (VCS) organisations to have a much greater involvement in the running of public services. The VCS is central to our commitment to building a Big Society. This is demonstrated by today’s announcement of around £60m each year for the next two years for VCS organisations. This is a significant investment in a tough financial climate, and is only one aspect of the funding we will route through the voluntary and community sector. The voluntary sector plays, and will continue to play, a significant role in reforming services for children, young people and families. I hope this grant further inspires a responsive and determined sector to do even more to improve outcomes for children, young people, parents and families. Notes to editors This grant is part of a wider range of DfE funding opportunities. A number of contracted services will be procured through separate formal tender processes and there are likely to be other funding opportunities as a result of developing policies e.g. the forthcoming SEN and Disability Green Paper. In addition to central government funding available on a national basis, the Department continues to fund the voluntary and community sector indirectly through local authorities and for services which are commissioned by schools. While the VCS cannot be immune from reductions in public expenditure, the Spending Review announced that Government will direct around £470 million over the SR period to support capacity building in the sector, including an endowment fund to assist local voluntary and community organisations. As part of this, the Government will provide funds to pilot the National Citizen Service and establish a Transition Fund of £100 million to provide short term support for voluntary sector organisations providing public services. The sector will also be able to access funding from the Big Society Bank, which will bring in private sector funding in addition to receiving all funding available to England from dormant accounts. The Big Society bank will start operating in April with up to £100m of the £400m from dormant accounts being made available this year. High street banks are going to lend it another £200m on commercial terms. The Funding amounts are indicative. Year 1 funding is dependent on successful negotiations on detail of the grants. Year two amounts are dependent on successful delivery of agreed outcomes. A list of successful organisations is in the following table Successful VCS Organisations Disclaimer: The Funding amounts are indicative.

/government/news/children-who-have-early-education-get-higher-gcses,"A child has more chance of getting better exam results and ultimately earning higher wages by receiving pre-school education, a study published today (September 9 2014) has shown. The Effective Pre-School, Primary and Secondary ( EPPSE ) research shows children who go to pre-school are projected to earn £27,000 more during their career than those who don’t. They are also more likely to get better GCSE results - the equivalent of getting 7 Bs compared to 7 Cs. The research also found that early education helped young people to specifically do better in GCSE English and maths. The effects were better if the pre-school was of high quality, and pre-school is particularly valuable for children from less advantaged backgrounds. Sam Gyimah, Education and Childcare Minister, said: Before they have even worn their school uniform for the first time, a child’s life chances are being decided. Early education not only sets a child off on the right foot at school but, as this extensive research shows, has effects that last right into the workplace. No child should start school behind their peers. This is why as part of our plan for education we are committed to providing flexible, affordable and good quality childcare, giving parents more of a choice about where they can send their children, so that they can get the best start in life. The EPPSE project launched in 1997 and has followed 3,000 children from early childhood to the age of 16. The research was carried out by leading academics at the Institute of Education, University of Oxford, and Birkbeck, University of London. Professor of Educational Psychology at Oxford University Kathy Sylva, who worked on the research, said: The EPPSE study is unique because it provides valuable evidence in Europe on the long term value of pre-school - no other research has done this. The results are clear - early education pays off, and high quality pre-school education gives children the very best start in life. High quality early education has enduring benefits for the children who experience it and also the society that invests in it. The government funds 15 hours per week of early education for all 3- and 4-year-olds. Last month, the eligibility of 2-year-olds to receive 15 hours per week of free childcare was doubled to include 40% of all 2-year-olds from poorer families. Tax free childcare has also been introduced, which could save a working family up to £2,000 per child per year from 2015. Notes to editors The EPPSE ‘Students’ educational and developmental outcomes at age 16’ report is available online. The Effective Pre-school and Primary Education project (EPPE) started in 1997 and was the first major longitudinal study in Europe to investigate the impact of pre-school provision on a national sample of children. The are 5 principal investigators: Prof Kathy Sylva and Prof Pam Sammons (both University of Oxford), Prof Ted Melhuish (Birkbeck, University of London), Prof Iram Siraj and Brenda Taggart (both Institute of Education). The final reports on the KS4 phase of the project explore the influences on students’ academic and social outcomes at age 16. The research also estimates some of the economic returns from society’s investment in early education. Research was conducted through a nationally representative sample of children in 141 pre-school settings was drawn in 1997 from 5 English regions (6 local authorities). A sample of children who had no or minimal pre-school experience were recruited to the study at entry to school for comparison with the pre-school group. EPPSE researchers assessed the children at recruitment to the study to create a profile of each child’s intellectual and social/behavioural development using standardised assessments and reports from the pre-school worker who knew the child best. Children were assessed again at entry to school and the children have been followed up at ages 6, 7, 10 and 11 in primary school and at ages 14 and 16 in secondary school. The children involved are now aged between 18 and 21. The original sample was spread over 4 academic years. The youngest completed their GCSEs in 2012. A sample of children who had no pre-school experience were also recruited for comparison. At GCSE , the benefits of going to pre-school translate into an extra 41 points - the difference between getting, for example, 7 grade Bs versus 7 Cs. Additional analysis of the EPPSE findings by the Institute for Fiscal Studies ( IFS ) shows that there are also economic returns. IFS estimate that children who’ve attended pre-school will be £27,000 better off over a lifetime.

/ofsted-inspection-childcare-provider,"You’ll be inspected by Ofsted when you’re registered as a childminder or childcare provider to make sure you’re meeting the requirements for safety, and learning and development. If you don’t meet these requirements, you’ll be told what you need to do to improve and when you need to improve by. Childcare Register You could be inspected at any time if you’re only on the Childcare Register. You’ll get a letter telling you’ve met the requirements or not. This result will be published online for one year . If you’re on the Childcare Register and the Early Years Register, you’ll be inspected for both at the same time. Read more about how inspections are done . Early Years Register If you’re on the Early Years Register, you’ll usually be inspected within the first 30 months of registration and then at least once in every inspection cycle. The current Early Years inspection cycle finishes on 31 July 2016. You’ll also be inspected if someone reports concerns about the childcare you’re providing. Getting notice of an inspection Nurseries and pre-schools will get a call on or after midday on the working day before the start of the inspection. You’ll still be inspected even if the inspector hasn’t been able to speak to anyone at the nursery or pre-school. Childminders or providers that don’t operate regularly will get a call up to 5 days before an inspection to check what days they work and if there will be children present. You’ll be told what time the inspection will start but not what day it will start. You can be inspected without warning. This is normally if Ofsted are concerned about the childcare you provide. If you’re a home childcarer, Ofsted will ask the occupier of the home where you work for permission to carry out the inspection. Before the inspection visit You must tell parents an inspection is going to take place. You can do a self evaluation online . During the inspection visit To find out about the quality of teaching and learning you provide, the inspector will: observe the children at play talk to you and the children observe how you and the children interact check the children’s levels of understanding and if they take part in learning talk to you about the children’s knowledge, skills and abilities observe care routines and how they’re used to support children’s personal development evaluate your knowledge of the early years curriculum The inspector will give you feedback and explain what needs to be done to improve, if necessary. After the inspection visit You’ll be sent a report with your grade. You’ll be told how to do better, if there’s anything that can be improved. You’ll be graded as one of the following: Grade 1 - outstanding Grade 2 - good Grade 3 - requires improvement Grade 4 - inadequate Read the early years inspection handbook to find out what these grades mean. Your inspection report will be published online within 10 working days of you being sent it. You must give a copy of the report to the parents of the children you look after and to anyone else who asks for one, unless you applied to register voluntarily. If your judgement is ‘outstanding’ You can use the Ofsted outstanding provider logo on your stationery and website. If your judgement is ‘inadequate’ You’ll be inspected again within 6 months. You’ll be told what you must do to remain registered, and the date by which it must be done. Your local authority will also be informed, which may affect your eligibility for funding. If you’re judged as ‘inadequate with enforcement’ You’ll be monitored by an inspector. They’ll visit you to check how you’re progressing against the areas you were told needed improvement. Ofsted may take further action if there’s no improvement. If you have 2 inspections in a row where you’re judged as inadequate, Ofsted can cancel your registration. Complain about an inspection You can make a complaint during or after an inspection."
/government/speeches/elizabeth-truss-speech-to-the-daycare-trust-conference,"Thanks, Anand (Shukla, Chief Executive, Daycare Trust), I’m very glad to be here. There has been a lot of debate about the childcare system recently. I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the Daycare Trust, which has championed the importance of childcare for so long. I very much value your input and look forward to working with you in the months to come. A few weeks ago, I went to an early years seminar hosted by Frank Field, where academic experts presented a compelling chart. It showed that, in England, much more so than in other high-performing countries, major educational gaps open up not at 16 or even at 11, but by the age of five. There can surely be no clearer illustration of why early education matters so much. Why we must do much more to take advantage of this terrific opportunity, before they start school, when young minds are so open to learning and development. To give all children, especially those from low-income families, a good start that will help them fulfil their potential over a lifetime. Recent progress Like you, my ambition is for our childcare system to be the best in the world. To be high quality, affordable and to offer parents choice. There’s been some good progress in recent years. We’ve just announced that we’re providing local authorities with more than half a billion pounds next year to implement the early education programme for two-year-olds from lower-income families. A record 96 per cent of three- and four-year-olds are already benefitting from this programme, with 88 per cent of parents saying they’re satisfied. Quality and professionalism is improving in the sector, with Ofsted’s inspection regime one of our system’s great strengths. As of last week, parents and providers will be able to see how many good and outstanding providers there are in each local area through a new online tool on Ofsted’s website. And as you know, we’ve commissioned a number of childcare reviews. We’ll be responding to Professor Nutbrown’s valuable recommendations about strengthening the qualifications and skills of the workforce shortly. There’s also the commission on childcare which I’m leading with Steve Webb from the Department of Work and Pensions, which will also report soon. Problems with the current system Now, overall, we’re spending more than ever on early years and childcare - around £5 billion a year, with funding set to rise by another £1 billion between now and 2015. Yet, despite this, parents, especially mothers, are being put off work by high childcare costs. Some families spend almost a third (27 per cent) of net family income on childcare, more than double the OECD average of 12 per cent. The recent Resolution Foundation study lays bare the challenge faced by some middle-income families. It found, for example, that a family with two children, in which two earners bring in a total of £44,000, could end up just £4,000 better off - because of childcare costs - than a single parent family earning £20,000 less because of childcare costs. Just think of the tremendous talent and skills that we could tap into if it was easier for mothers to access childcare and go out to work. The gains for family incomes, for women’s career opportunities, for the wider economy could be significant. We now have fewer mothers going to work than some countries in Europe -Eurostat figures show that 66 per cent of British mothers work, compared to 72 per cent in France, 83 per cent in Denmark and 78 per cent in the Netherlands and 70 per cent in Germany. We’ve been overtaken in recent years by countries such as Germany where the number of working mothers has gone up by eight per cent following a national campaign to increase the availability of all-day schools. All of this wouldn’t matter if parents didn’t want to work. But a survey by my department shows that half of mothers who aren’t working want to work, but the cost and availability of childcare is one significant barrier they face. However, high costs aren’t the only problem. Provision is of variable quality. And too many staff are low-paid and low-skilled, meaning that the status of the workforce is not what it could be. Need to build the workforce So what can we do to turn this around? The evidence from Professor Nutbrown’s review and from other childcare systems abroad suggests the answer lies with people and not processes. High-quality staff are the key to building an efficient, high-quality system; in preparing children for school and closing the educational gap between children from rich and poor backgrounds. And in the greater flexibility their enhanced skills give employers, to operate more effectively and cut costs to parents. Yet staff working in early years currently don’t even need a C grade in English or maths at GCSE to work in early years. As Professor Nutbrown has remarked, you can hardly expect staff to teach young children how to read, write and add up when they haven’t mastered the basics in English and maths themselves. And too many early professionals are poorly paid - barely more the minimum wage. So, a childcare worker in England earns around half what he or she might make in Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands and almost 38 per cent less than in France. It’s a similar situation with supervisors. Staff have also been hamstrung by a bureaucratic, box-ticking approach which we’re changing by, for example, streamlining the Early Years Foundation Stage Framework- I’m pleased this has been widely welcomed. But there is more we can do. I want the early years profession to be a really attractive option for school leavers and graduates. There are encouraging signs that this is happening - the percentage of paid staff holding a higher level qualification rose from 65 per cent in 2007 to 79 per cent in 2011. I want this to be an occupation that offers clear routes for career progression and a standing on a par with other professions. This means more staff being better paid, better trained and better qualified as we move towards an ever increasingly professional workforce. It means staff being given greater autonomy to exercise their professional judgement. And it means nurseries making sure they’re using existing freedoms to recruit more graduates and be more flexible about staffing, while always remaining focused on the fundamentals - the safety and quality of care. What we can learn from other countries I want a clear focus on quality; skills, professional autonomy, and value for money as seen in childcare systems abroad. I recently visited some nurseries in France where staff are well-qualified and take responsibility for looking after more children. I was most impressed to see children being led in well-structured activities in bright, well-organised settings. The children were enthusiastic and eager to learn. And the experience and skills of the staff shone through. This reflects the fact that three quarters of staff in French creches and childcare services have to have an appropriate diploma, which is broadly equivalent to a year of study after A levels. Qualified teachers teach nursery classes and most nursery assistants hold diplomas. Younger children are looked after in structured group sessions led by highly qualified professionals . Similarly, in Denmark, daycare facilities are run by highly qualified managers who have completed a three-and-a-half year course in a specialised training college. And they’re staffed with professionals who have received secondary vocational training. Again, the workforce is so highly skilled, that they’re trusted to use their expertise to staff their settings as they deem appropriate, with with no nationally prescribed staff: child ratios in place. It’s a system that’s clearly working well for parents, with Denmark boasting above average maternal employment rates - 71 per cent of mothers with children under three are working compared to 56 per cent in the UK. There are, of course, differences between our system and those in France and Denmark. But running through provision in these countries is a respect for professional judgement and a belief in the importance of skilful and knowledgeable staff that we could learn from. After all, we know, from our own experience with the Academies programme, that giving professionals greater autonomy and transparency works. By directly funding these schools and freeing headteachers to run them and recruit the best staff, academies have turned around hundreds of struggling schools and are improving their results at twice the national average. Their achievements have been recognised by Ofsted which, in turn, is now focused more tightly on the things that really matter - quality of teaching, leadership, pupil attainment and behaviour and safety. There’s no reason why giving early years professionals similar freedoms couldn’t drive improvements in childcare. Funding Another key area where we’re looking to learn from other countries is funding. We’re pumping large sums into childcare - as a share of GDP, the Government is spending twice the OECD average. It’s true that we spend less than Denmark, but our spending is comparable with France and we spend more than Germany. But providers are still struggling to stay afloat and parents are facing rising costs. We must make our money work harder. A recent IPPR report concluded that our current system is “expensive”, “inefficient” and “confusing”. I’m keen to improve this. We’re already making changes. You can see this in the way we’re rolling out the two-year-old programme, so that funding is more transparent and focused on the high-quality settings that research tells us provide lasting educational benefits to children. At the moment, there are significant differences between the rates different local authorities pay for three- and four-year-olds. A National Audit Office report on the three- and four-year-old programme, published in February this year, found that wide variations in funding levels and the complexity of local funding formulae created administrative burdens for providers operating in more than one area. We want high-quality providers to expand their businesses and bring their expertise to parts of the country where provision is currently patchy. But it’s difficult for them to offer a consistent quality of service across the country when the amount they’re paid in different areas varies so much. I recently met childminders and nursery managers in Leeds. They were passionate and articulate about providing high-quality care and education for young children and meeting the needs of local parents. They told me that the base rate paid by some local authorities in the region for early education for three- and four-year-olds was around £3 per child per hour. Other local authorities paid as much as £5. I want providers to be able to expand wherever there is demand, and not be held back by variability in funding rates between neighbouring authorities. So, in introducing the two-year-old programme, we’re, firstly, providing enough money - over half a billion pounds in 2013-14 - to recruit and retain the best quality early years staff and to boost the skills of existing staff. I have also ensured that funding for the two-year-old places will be delivered with greater transparency than ever before. Last week, I announced individual allocations to local authorities for the two-year-old programme in 2013-14. I also confirmed the Department’s estimates for the number of children who will be eligible in each area. This means that for the first time, local authorities, providers and parents will be able to see exactly how much has been provided to authorities for the two-year-old places. I will let you do the maths. But if you divide the funding by the number of places, and then divide that by 570 hours, you will see just how much per hour each local authority has been given. Nationally, this works out at an average rate of £5.09 per child per hour. This is significantly above the average market rate of £4.13 per hour as reported in the Daycare Trust’s own childcare cost survey this year. I want local authorities to take their cue from the National Audit Office, and offer a clear and simple rate for the delivery of the two-year-old places. Because setting a simple, sustainable funding rate is vital to give providers the confidence to become part of the programme. Providers will know they can go anywhere in the country and be confident that a local authority has enough funds to pay for a high quality place. This is where Ofsted’s new online tool will be very useful - for providers to see where there’s good and outstanding provision and where there are gaps in the market they can fill. Our aim is for as many children as possible to receive early education in good and outstanding settings. But for this to happen, funds need to reach the front line. So I’m urging local authorities to make sure this funding is passed on to providers. We’ll be publishing the actual amount every local authority has passed on, on the Department’s website next year, so parents and providers will be able to compare rates across the country and hold authorities to account. It’s also crucial that local authorities raise awareness, so that as many families as possible take up the two-year-old offer. I’ve made it clear to local authorities that in future, funding will be linked to the number of children participating, so funding will go down if we don’t achieve high levels of take-up. Conclusion That may sound somewhat impatient, but I’m determined to deliver improvements in early education as quickly as possible. With your help, I want to make the system more efficient and affordable, with the emphasis firmly on quality. Having listened carefully to the views of parents and childcare professionals, we’ll be taking forward work from Professor Nutbrown’s review and from the childcare commission in the coming weeks and months. As part of the commission, we’re considering reducing regulation that places an unnecessary burden on providers. We’ve also been looking at wraparound and holiday care for school-age children and have found an inspiring range of activities on offer in different schools. We will report on this soon. I also recently visited Germany and saw first-hand how high-quality, well-planned extra-curricular activities, supervised by highly-qualified, non-teaching staff, have been integrated into schools in Berlin and are catering for children of all ages. These staff work closely with teachers to support pupils throughout the school day - which, with lessons interspersed with non-academic activities and study time, can run from half seven in the morning to four o’clock in the evening. Wrap-around care in some schools extends that offer from six in the morning until six at night. There, as here, this offers greater flexibility for working parents. I want to see what we can learn from this. I would also like to see all providers - nurseries, childminders and schools - to step up to the challenge so that good and outstanding settings become the norm. Lower quality providers must raise their game. High-quality providers should consider options for expanding to meet demand. I hope new providers will also come forward to offer their services. I’m keen to work with you, the early years profession, and with parents, over the coming months, to develop a system that our children truly deserve. For children’s life chances, which, as I said at the start, depend so much on their readiness to learn when they start school. For parents who need to work to support their families and want to be sure their child is receiving safe, high-quality education and care that’s affordable. And for early years professionals, who should be well-rewarded and recognised for the vital job they do, as part of an increasingly skilled workforce. Thank you."

/government/speeches/michael-gove-to-the-national-conference-of-directors-of-childrens-and-adult-services,"Thank you, Shireen, and thank you Marion, for your very kind introduction. It’s a special pleasure to be here in Manchester, home of one of our greatest football clubs (Manchester City), home of one of our most amazing schools (Manchester Academy), and home to one of the most striking examples of urban regeneration in the country - Manchester’s revived city centre. All of them evidence that when local people, local institutions and local government are given a broader canvas on which to operate, their ambitions can exceed anything imagined. I want to say a little bit today about the ambitious agenda the coalition government has for education - and children’s services. And in particular I want to outline how, working together, we can be more ambitious about what children and young people can achieve in Britain. A power shift and a horizon shift It’s been 6 months since the new coalition government was established as a partnership between two parties determined to work together in the national interest to resolve the big problems our country faces. Since the government was formed we’ve set to work to restore our finances, reduce the massive deficit we inherited and put public services on a sustainable footing. We have started to reform our political system to make it fairer, more accountable and more transparent; embarked on reforms of education, health and welfare to promote social justice; and taken steps to accelerate economic growth by improving vocational training, investing in science and lifting the bureaucratic burden on business. Our reform programme is driven by two principles shared across the coalition parties. We believe in shifting power down from central government to the lowest possible level - to local authorities, schools, mutuals and co-ops, GP consortia, community groups, families and individuals. And alongside this power shift, we believe in setting policy with a determined eye on the long-term. Whether it’s reforming higher education, taking radical action on energy efficiency or investing more in pre-school learning for our 2-year-olds, the government believes in a horizon shift where tough decisions are taken now so the country can enjoy a more sustainably prosperous future. It’s a challenging agenda. But then again it needs to be, because our country can’t afford - literally cannot afford - not to change radically. The economic mess we find ourselves in means we need to change. The huge numbers of talented young people who still do not achieve as they should means we need to change. And the new demands from the public that we deliver services much more efficiently means we need to change. Changing does not mean rejecting the gains we have already made as a society. It’s quite the opposite - unless we change we will not be able to generate the wealth and opportunities, we will not be able to provide the security and comfort, that we have grown used to expecting. I am an unreserved admirer of many of the advances we’ve made as a country over the last few decades. In the 80s we put the days of relative economic decline behind us. In the nineties we became a more tolerant, compassionate and open nation. And over the last decade there’s been a renewed emphasis on spreading opportunity more widely. Specifically, there’s been a growing sense that we must ensure our taxpayer-funded public services are as responsive to individual demands and as efficient in their operations as those private sector organisations that have benefitted from innovation and competition. Together, these forces and trends have driven progress. But even as we look back and see how far we’ve come, it is much more important that we look around us and see how fast others are going. Across the globe other nations are modernising their economies, reforming their ways of working, challenging vested interests, demanding better performance, transforming public service, and making power more accountable, government more transparent and opportunity more equal. And the pace of change is everywhere accelerating. In East Asia, millions more are being educated to a higher level than ever before every year. In Scandinavia, taxes are being cut and technological change is driving new business growth. In North America, new ways of providing public services are being pioneered which put the empowered citizen in control. We cannot ignore, or resist, these trends. It’s in the nature of our world that jobs, investment, innovation and growth will migrate to those jurisdictions with the best trained workers, the best educated citizens, the most efficient governments, the most responsive services, the most civilized public square. If we are to ensure our citizens enjoy a civilized future, with the economic growth which will sustain a prosperous and comfortable future for all, then we must accelerate reform here. We have to keep pace with the world’s innovation nations. And, sadly, at the moment we are falling behind. The fierce urgency of the need for education reform In the last ten years we have fallen behind other countries in the international league tables of school performance - falling from fourth in the world for science to fourteenth, seventh in the world for literacy to seventeenth, and eighth in the world for maths to twenty-fourth. If we are to raise attainment for all children, turn round underperforming schools where students have been poorly served for years, close the gap between rich and poor and make opportunity more equal, we need to work at every level to accelerate the pace of change. Local authorities have a central role to play. The services you provide are critical to our shared mission of giving every child, and young person, the best possible start in life. From the support given in the earliest years, through Sure Start and other settings, to the effective policing of admissions rules to guarantee fair access for all students; from the expertise required to support children with special educational needs to the challenge which underperforming schools require to improve, local authorities are our essential partners in the fight to extend every child’s opportunities. I am grateful for all the support, advice and encouragement I have received from colleagues in local government, councillors from all parties and officials at every level, and the Schools White Paper we plan to publish later this year will reflect the conversations I have had with local government colleagues as well as outline new and exciting ways of working together. Increased autonomy for local authorities I have been influenced by the growing sense among the most innovative leaders in the public sector that we will only secure the progress we need to make as a country if we continually drive responsibility and decision-making down to the lowest possible level. Progress depends on encouraging creativity, making services more responsive to individual citizens, allowing valid comparisons between different providers to be made and using transparency - not central direction - to drive value for money. There are huge opportunities here for local government. As we shift power downwards, there is massive potential for the creative use of greater autonomy on the part of those who lead both schools and local authorities. We propose to give local authorities progressively greater freedoms as they become strategic delivery partners. At the moment there are countless targets, onerous inspection regimes and a stultifying culture of compliance, with a proliferation of ring-fences, an overkill of regulations and a burgeoning thicket of guidance. All of these centrally-driven interventions have made government less local. That is why we are stripping them away. By removing comprehensive area assessment and ending local area agreements, we have begun to remove the bureaucratic burdens that have been applied by central government to local government. The space has been cleared for local authorities to be more daring and imaginative in how they provide services and deploy resources. Today I am going a step further to liberate local authorities by announcing the ending of statutory requirements on them to set and then police a whole range of externally imposed performance targets on schools and Early Years settings. Instead, local authorities will be able to develop their own plans to improve the quality of Early Years provision. And you will be free to develop new and innovative ways of supporting the vulnerable across your local areas. With the additional resources we are making available for the education of the poorest two-year olds, the schooling of all poorer children and early intervention to help those most in need, you will have the funding, and the freedom, to make a real difference. Sharper accountability for underperforming schools As well as granting local authorities greater autonomy, the Coalition Government is also making good its commitment to grant schools greater autonomy. I am grateful for the constructive way in which local authorities have worked to ensure we can offer all schools the promise of greater control over their destiny. We have extended the opportunity to all schools to move towards academy status, with outstanding schools leading the way. One new academy has been created every working day of this new school term. Those schools have used their new freedoms to help others. And all schools, whether or not they are making the journey towards academy status, are being given greater freedoms from central government. We have abolished the self-evaluation form, reduced the data collection burden and told Ofsted to slim down its inspection criteria. We will be slimming down the National Curriculum, making governance simpler and financial management less onerous. All of these steps will give school leaders more freedom to concentrate on their core responsibilities - teaching and learning. Different schools will go down different paths, at different paces. Some will want to move rapidly to academy status; others will follow, perhaps as part of a broader trust or federation. Yet others will want to maintain their current status. A partnership for good And because there will be a diversity of paths, so there will be a different role for local authorities with respect to schools. We want all local authorities to play a central role as guardians of social justice, ensuring admissions are fair. We expect all local authorities to discharge an essential role as providers of support for children with special educational needs. We will work with all local authorities to ensure there is sufficient high-quality alternative provision. And we will encourage all local authorities to be champions of educational excellence - challenging individual schools to improve, encouraging great schools to share their expertise, putting underperforming schools on notice if they are not improving. But we anticipate, and will welcome, a more diverse approach to the provision of school improvement services. The success of the work of National Leaders of Education, the National College of School Leadership, and trusts led by great school leaders such as Mike Wilkins or Barry Day, demonstrates that school-to-school improvement generates great results. I expect that local authorities will want to make more use of NLEs, and encourage the creation of more federations to drive improvement. If local authorities believe they can provide a strong school-improvement service themselves, they should be free to do so by offering their service to schools on a level playing field to other providers. That could mean some local authorities offer school-improvement services to schools beyond their own geographical borders. Greater diversity, and contestability, can only help drive up standards and I know that is our shared goal. Addressing disadvantage head on Because I know that all of you, like me, have as one of your top priorities turning round the performance of our most challenging schools. We all have a duty to ensure there are minimum standards of performance through the school system. It can’t be acceptable to have so many schools in which two-thirds of children fail to secure five good GCSEs. Minimum standards at GCSE have risen in recent years, in line with the increased aspirations of parents and communities. Those school leaders and local authorities who have driven the fastest improvements deserve special credit. But given the quickening pace of school improvement across the globe, I believe it’s now essential that we demonstrate that we are stepping up our reform programme. I will therefore be finalising details of new floor standards shortly, for inclusion in my forthcoming Schools White Paper. These will apply from January 2011, when we have the verified and final summer 2010 examination data. In setting new standards I want to be clear that we are determined to tackle underperformance, but I want to avoid the errors of the past which meant some felt unfairly stigmatised. That is why we will be offering support first. On top of the pupil premium, and in addition to other financial support for those in greatest need, I have announced the creation of a new education endowment fund worth £110 million. Local authorities should be among those bidding to use this additional money to raise attainment in our most challenging schools. We will identify the schools in the most challenging circumstances in the fairest and most rigorous way possible. The measures we use will recognise the need for schools to improve both their levels of attainment and the progress they make with their pupils. Academy sponsors and underperforming schools Central to our approach to school standards, especially in tackling the most significant areas of underperformance, will be our Academies programme. I am delighted that so many local authorities and school leaders have seen how academies can improve performance, with academies securing improvements at GCSE level twice as fast as other schools and the best academy chains doing much, much better than that. I want to expand the programme in three important areas. First, we should be looking to spread the experience of academies to tackle underperformance in the primary sector, which is why we will have clear floor standards for primaries. Second, the central role of some academies in federations of schools and more extended networks is demonstrating the potential for academies developed through clusters of schools within a local area. And most important of all, too many underperforming schools that were above the minimum threshold we inherited have not received sufficient attention and support. I want the Department to work with sponsors and local authorities to consider solutions to a wider range of underperforming schools. I have been encouraged by my conversations with many local authorities, which have confirmed the potential for further progress. I would like local authorities to consider more schools for academy status, where both attainment and pupil progression are low and where schools lack the capacity to improve themselves. In particular, I want to focus our shared attention on how to improve schools where: attainment is low and pupils progress poorly the most recent Ofsted judgement is that the school is eligible for intervention or is merely satisfactory (the latter is included to reflect wider issues in the school such as its capacity to improve, or in key areas such as leadership and governance) there is a record of low attainment over time - whether or not the most recent results have crossed a minimum threshold, we should be looking at whether the previous results indicate those increases are sustainable and pupils in secondary schools achieve poorly compared to schools with similar intakes. The minimum standards on attainment and progression will be set out in the white paper. But these should be regarded as guidelines, not rigid criteria. Where schools fall outside these benchmarks but local authorities consider that schools would still benefit from the involvement of sponsors, I would encourage you to make proposals for the conversion of those schools. However, where schools are facing challenges across the board, decisive action is clearly needed. Some of the most successful academy sponsors have been deepening their relationships with local authorities and with groups of schools, to consider how they might bring new solutions to other underperforming schools without the initial involvement of the Department. I have actively encouraged sponsors to work directly with local authorities in this way. Equally, we are seeing an increasing number of local authorities proposing the development of new academies and making links directly with sponsors, which I also very much welcome. Officials from the Department will continue to support and facilitate the brokering of new academies between schools, local authorities and sponsors. I see this as a continuation of the collaborative approach that has been fostered over the years to secure the replacement of such schools with academies. I very much want that partnership approach to continue. For some years, we have also had powers on the statute book for the Secretary of State to intervene directly in failing schools. The new Academies Act enables me to make an Academy Order in respect of any school that is eligible for intervention. This includes, specifically, schools that Ofsted has judged to require special measures or significant improvement or which have failed to respond to a valid warning notice. I will be ready to use this power in the months ahead where I judge that academy status is in the best interests of an eligible school and its pupils, and where it has not been possible to reach agreement on a way ahead with the local authority, the school or both. Of course, I would hope that I do not need to use these powers extensively as I fully expect local authorities to use their own extensive intervention powers to bring about change in poorly performing schools that are failing to improve. But where there is a lack of decisive action or a reluctance to consider the necessary academy solution, then I will not hesitate to act. Officials in the Department will be talking both to local authorities and to sponsors, to identify the best opportunities for progress. Children at the heart of everything we do Because publication of our Schools White Paper is imminent, I have concentrated so far today on the work we can do together to improve education. But I am critically aware that your responsibilities extend far beyond the school gate. From reforming child protection to protecting child and adolescent mental health services, from safeguarding the provision of play facilities to enhancing youth services, from supporting Sure Start to improving careers advice for school leavers, your responsibilities are also my priorities. And the same principles, and vision, which drive our approach to schools guide us in all these areas. We believe in trusting professionals more, just as much when they are social workers as when they are teachers, which is why we have commissioned Eileen Munro to review how we can better support social work professionals. We believe in opening up the provision of services to new providers with new ideas and anticipate we can improve support for the vulnerably by harnessing the dynamism of civil society. We believe transparency aids good government and makes decision-making better, which is why we have asked for serious case reviews to be published. We believe that nothing is more important than overcoming barriers to social mobility, which is why we are investing more in getting Early Years education right. And we are convinced that young people deserve to have their horizons broadened and aspirations raised beyond the expectations of previous generations, which is why we will reform careers advice and guidance. I appreciate this is change at a pace and across a range of policies which is nothing if not demanding. But I believe that the world in which we live means we have no option but to embrace change and take control of the future. If we do not shape global forces they will shape us. And it is, above all, my desire to grant individuals the right to shape their own future, which drives me. Education is, for me, about freeing people from imposed constraints, liberating them from the accidents of birth, allowing them to acquire the knowledge, skills and qualifications which allow them to choose the satisfying job they have always aspired to and the rich inner life which brings true fulfilment. Everything we are arguing for, and all the changes we hope to make, are about giving more children and young people the power to decide their own fates, to become authors of their own life stories. I know you all share that ambition, and every time we meet I am continually impressed by the energy, ambition and idealism you bring to the mission of improving all our children’s lives - which is why it is such a pleasure to work with all of you and to be with you today."
/government/news/childcare-investment-readiness-fund-update,"On 26 February 2015, it was announced that businesses looking to expand their presence in the early years market will be boosted by a new £500,000 Department for Education grant to help usher in the new culture through the childcare investment readiness fund. Today (25 March 2015), it has been announced that the grant management of the fund will be delivered by Social Investment Business (SIB) who, over the last 3 years, have supported a range of charities and social enterprises to raise new social investment for the first time. Applications for the investment readiness fund will be assessed by an ‘investment panel’ made up of experts who will decide which bids would make future social investment most attractive to social investors. The childcare investment readiness fund is modelled on the Cabinet Office’s investment and contract readiness fund. It will support childcare providers with a proven track record to become more appealing to investors. Successful bids for the investment readiness fund will receive up to £45,000 per partnership. Childcare providers and social enterprises can now register their interest in the fund on the Social Investment Business website ."
/government/speeches/nick-gibb-the-fruits-of-autonomy,"The government’s education reforms over the past 4-and-a-half years have been the most far-reaching for a generation. Our reforms to the curriculum, making it more knowledge-based and academically rigorous - and our focus on raising standards of pupil behaviour in the classroom, enabling teachers to spend more time teaching - are both key elements of this reform. But today I want to talk about our structural reforms that have delivered professional autonomy. At the centre of these is academisation, making schools free from local authority control. Accompanying this were numerous smaller reforms, designed to pass powers back to teachers and heads - the aim, to let a thousand flowers bloom. We are now in the enviable position of being able to see which of these flowers have bloomed the brightest. I first became Shadow Schools Minister in 2005, and after 9 years of witnessing some of the most gifted educators in England, I am repeatedly struck by a new vibrancy and excitement in the English education system. Schools are, with no shadow of a doubt, improving. As of this summer, the proportion of schools judged ‘good’ or ‘outstanding’ by Ofsted at their most recent inspection reached 80%, compared with 70% in 2012. Our reforms to GCSEs are helping reverse the decline in the number of pupils taking rigorous academic qualifications. The number of pupils taking challenging EBacc subjects has risen dramatically under this government. In 2010, only 22% of pupils in state-funded schools entered all EBacc subjects. In the most recent academic year, this rose to almost 39%. Over the same period, entries to history or geography have risen from 48% to 65%, and entries to languages from 40% to 50%. My mother was a primary school teacher, so early years education has always been a key concern for me. I am delighted that the number of 6-year-olds able to decode simple words and pass the phonics screening check at the end of year 1 has increased from 58% in 2012 to 74% in 2014. That’s 102,000 more 6-year-olds on track to be reading more effectively as a direct result of this policy. The number of persistent truants has fallen from 433,130 in 2009 to 2010, to 300,895 during the last academic year. Autonomy is not about government directives, committees of experts, quango worthies or national strategies costing hundreds of millions of pounds. It is about associations of like-minded people, bound by a common purpose - academy trusts, teaching school alliances, independent training organisations, charities, social enterprises and online communities. Call it civil society - call it the third sector. It is with these little platoons of idealistic people that the future of our school system lies. This was why this government launched the free schools programme in 2010. We wanted to provide outlets for idealism - opportunities for dedicated groups of individuals who believed they could improve school provision. Such groups of individuals have exceeded our expectations. The best academy chains, such as Ark Schools and the Harris Federation, have expanded and replicated their proven success. Ark Schools have opened 3 free schools, with 8 more in development. Likewise, the Harris Federation has opened 8 free schools, with 5 more in development. And we have seen, much older institutions play a new role in educating our young people. The London Academy of Excellence sixth-form college was established 2-and-a-half years ago by a collection of independent schools including Brighton College, Eton College and Highgate School. Situated in Newham, the LAE ’s ambition was to channel the brightest pupils from London’s most deprived borough into top universities. 2 years later, its A level results beat those of several well-known public schools. 68 pupils from its first cohort gained places at Russell Group Universities, including 5 at Oxford and Cambridge. This year, more London Academy of Excellence pupils were offered places at Oxbridge than has ever been achieved by the entire borough of Newham in any previous year. Since 2010, this government has also pioneered university technical colleges, a new type of school geared towards providing technical education for 14- to 18-year-olds. Known as UTCs , they bridge the gap that too often exists between educational provision and the local job market by linking with a nearby university or employer. We now have the Silverstone UTC , Liverpool Life Sciences UTC and UTC Sheffield. Leading this innovation in vocational education has been Kenneth Baker, a truly inspiring public servant. Now in his ninth decade, Kenneth works tirelessly as chairman of the Baker Dearing Trust and has helped establish 30 UTCs already, with 26 already approved to open. In the same period, our academies programme has ensured that over 1,200 of the worst-performing schools have been taken over by successful sponsors or headteachers - the majority of which are already leading other schools with a proven track record of academic achievement. We have given the very best heads control over many more schools, with the freedom they need to ensure that the children in their care receive the education they deserve and need. And they have succeeded. Underperforming schools taken into the academies programme and placed under the leadership of great heads are improving more rapidly than those schools which remain in the hands of local authorities. This element of the academies programme is a deliberate continuation of an approach begun under the previous government, which we have championed and expanded. But the government firmly believes that the autonomy previously available to sponsored academies should be available to all schools. I am delighted that since 2010 more than 3,000 schools - including many of our highest-performing schools - have chosen to become academies. These schools have seized the opportunity to raise standards by using the freedoms we have given them. They can now vary their curriculum, extend the length of their school day and employ the best teachers - regardless of whether they have received formal qualified teacher status. In each of these cases, parts of civil society - be they teachers, school leaders, employers, philanthropists, universities or parent groups - are empowered to decide how future generations should be educated. There are now 646 sponsors, 550 chains of 2 schools or more, and 40 chains of at least 10 schools - of these, 9 are responsible for 30 schools or more. All of these rightly compete to raise academic standards for their pupils. And within and between chains, this spirit of competition is accompanied by a culture of collaboration - professionals working together to improve children’s education. Surveying today’s educational landscape, I derive enormous optimism from other organisations that are being established to support schools. Since Teach First was founded in 2003, 38 social enterprises have been set up by former participants in the programme - all examples of what can be achieved when real autonomy is delivered. Take one of these - the National Orchestra for All. Founded by Marianna Hay in 2011, the NOFA takes 150 musicians each year from schools in London and the west Midlands and forms a full orchestra, rehearsing throughout the year and giving pupils from these schools the opportunity to play in such venues as the Royal Albert Hall, the Southbank Centre and the Royal Academy of Music. Similarly, the Brilliant Club was formed in 2011 to bring fruits normally preserved for the more privileged within the reach of the less advantaged. It places postgraduate students in challenging schools to run university-style tutorials for groups of promising pupils. So far, the Brilliant Club has worked with 150 schools around Britain, connecting over 250 doctoral and postdoctoral researchers with 5,000 pupils. In September this year I had the privilege of attending a ResearchEd conference. These events have brought fresh thinking and new energy to debates about teaching practices in English schools. ResearchEd was founded in 2013 by teachers - not by the government or university education faculties. These teachers, led by Tom Bennett, are determined that what happens in their classrooms should be informed by evidence, not fad. And Teach First alumni such as Robert Peal, Kris Boulton, Katie Ashford and Joe Kirby are challenging current education orthodoxies. Their passionate iconoclasm, which refuses to accept mistaken and damaging conventional wisdom, is inspirational. Similarly, the Institute of Ideas - run by Claire Fox - has long been arguing that children deserve a curriculum which is more knowledge-based and rigorous. Its debating competition - Debating Matters - has reinvigorated formal debating in state schools. It was founded in 2002 by a physics teacher from south London called David Perks, today the principal of a free school in east London. Likewise, the debating competition Debate Mate brings 350 undergraduates from top universities to train young debaters in 220 challenging, inner-city schools around England. We are seeing the beginnings of an academic renaissance in our education system. Autonomy is at the heart of that renaissance. The great liberal politician Lord Beveridge is often invoked as the father of the British welfare state. Less often cited than the 1942 Beveridge report is a report he wrote in 1948 entitled ‘Voluntary Action’. In it, Beveridge specifically warned against monopolistic state provision, in which new ideas and new institutions are quashed instead of nurtured. Beveridge contrasted a totalitarian state, or a state monopoly, with a free society. He wrote that in a free society, ‘discontented individuals with new ideas can make a new institution to meet their needs. The field is open to experiment and success or failure; secession is the midwife of invention.’ In that passage, Beveridge offered the best-possible articulation of what this government’s school reform agenda has aimed to achieve. Beveridge was a liberal in the truest sense of the word. He believed that whilst services such as education can be paid for by the state, they should be provided by civil society. Our reforms have unleashed a previously untapped educational idealism within English civil society engaging thousands of groups and individuals, from millionaire carpet salesmen to Premiership football clubs, from high-tech companies to medieval guilds. As Minister for School Reform, I delight in seeing the fruits of this autonomy in all their vivid abundance. It reaffirms my belief that good government does not improve public services. It enables public services to improve themselves."

/government/news/parents-to-get-complete-picture-of-child-development,"Health Minister Dr Dan Poulter and Childcare and Education Minister Sam Gyimah will today (21 November 2014) announce that integrated health and early years reviews for 2 to 2-and-a-half-year-olds will be rolled out next year. Currently, health and early years reviews of young children are carried out separately. By integrating them, parents will get a more complete picture of their child, drawing on the expertise of health visitors and early years practitioners. Age 2 is a key development point where problems such as speech delay and behavioural issues emerge. Integrating these assessments will help avoid duplication and work towards giving parents the support they need. Integrated reviews will mean bringing together the healthy child programme review at 2 to 2-and-a-half and the early years progress check at age 2 years. The announcement comes as the Department for Education publishes a report , led by the National Children’s Bureau on a 2-year pilot of integrated reviews from 2012 to 2013. The report found that parents preferred this joined-up approach, and take-up of the reviews increased as a result. Integrated reviews will mean health and early years professionals will share information and may carry out the reviews together, giving parents a better picture of their child’s progress and reducing duplication. Health Minister Dr Dan Poulter said: This report shows that integrating health and early years reviews is better for children and their parents - giving a more complete picture of their child’s development and supporting children to the best start in life. Childcare and Education Minister Sam Gyimah said: The early years count and this new approach will reassure parents they have the information they need to support their children when they are growing up to give them the best possible start in life. This is a fantastic example of government departments working together to improve the services on offer to parents. Notes to editors The pilot ran for 2 years between 2012 and 2013, and included 10 different locations. The report recommended that local areas should decide the best approach to integrating the 2 reviews, based on local need/circumstances. Read the full implementation study: ‘ Implementation study: integrated review at age 2 to 2-and-a-half years ’. The National Children’s Bureau has published 2 further documents which will help local areas prepare for implementation of the integrated review by September 2015. The Early Intervention Foundation has today (21 November 2014) published a report, ‘ Getting it right for families: review of integrated systems and promising practice in early years ’, which has been welcomed by government. See ‘ Healthy Child Programme: review of children aged 2 ’. Read the Early years progress check guidance . All 3- and 4-year-olds now receive 15 hours of free childcare a week. We have also extended this to around 40% of 2-year-olds from disadvantaged backgrounds, and councils have a statutory duty to provide this. From next year the introduction of tax-free childcare will give 1.9 million families up to £2,000 support per child, and for working families on the lowest incomes up to 85% of their childcare costs will be met under Universal Credit.

/government/news/childcare-measures-small-business-enterprise-employment-act,"In July 2013, the government launched a public consultation on ‘The Regulation of Childcare’ which proposed a number of changes intended to promote a growing childcare market that meets the needs of working families. In February 2014, we published ‘ The regulation of childcare consultation: government response ’ which included our plans to go ahead with several proposals, including: allowing childminders to operate on suitable non-domestic premises for part of the working week enabling childcare providers to register multiple premises without completing a separate registration application each time These measures, which apply in England only, are included in the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Act 2015 and will come into force on 1 January 2016. Childminders on non-domestic premises From 1 January 2016, early years and later years childminders will be able to operate from suitable non-domestic premises for up to half their time whilst still registered as a childminder. This will give childminders the flexibility to provide childcare from different settings - if they wish to do so - by expanding the range of premises from which they can operate without registering separately as a childcare provider. For example, childminders (or groups of childminders) could work with schools to offer out-of-hours care from school premises before and after school or during the holidays. However, childminders will need to seek (and have received) approval from Ofsted or their childminder agency before they can operate from additional sites. Early years childminders will still be required to meet the standards and requirements set out in the early years foundation stage statutory framework while operating on non-domestic premises. For example, ratios will remain the same (although some childminders may choose to work together in groups of 2 or 3 in order to run a larger group). Registration of childcare premises From 1 January 2016, early years and later years childcare providers and childminders wishing to operate from multiple premises will make a single registration application to Ofsted or their childminder agency in respect of those settings, and will be able to add additional premises to an existing registration without completing a separate registration application each time they open or acquire a new site. This will reduce the bureaucratic and administrative burden on childcare providers and make it easier for them to register their settings. For example, a provider wishing to register 10 premises will no longer have to complete 10 separate registration applications. However, childcare providers wishing to operate from additional premises will be required to seek (and have received) approval from Ofsted or their childminder agency before they are able to do so. Ofsted plans to transfer all existing childcare providers to the single registration system from 1 January. In the meantime, Ofsted may contact providers to undertake some transitional work to prepare for this change."

/government/news/celeb-mum-of-the-year-backs-childcare-app-challenge,"The Department for Education has thrown open a challenge to the digital sector to find a solution to recent research that showed parents struggle to see what childcare options are available to them. A summit organised today (5 March 2015) brought the tech sector together with early years providers and stakeholders who know what parents want. Many attendees will next month bid for a pot of £200,000 in government funds to develop childcare apps or websites which will help parents find high-quality, accessible childcare close to home. Also in attendance was 2014 Celebrity Mum of the Year Michelle Heaton, who has herself experienced the complexity of searching for the right childcare options for her 2 children. The Department for Education launched the competition in response to Ipsos Mori research, which showed that parents find it difficult to navigate through numerous sources of information about childcare provision available to them. The report concluded that parents should have access to the information they need to make informed choices about childcare - and it is especially important for parents returning to work to understand the financial support and range of options available to them. Childcare Minister Sam Gyimah opened proceedings with a speech about the competition. The event also saw Q&A sessions and more detailed information about the applications process. Sam Gyimah said: Getting the right childcare is one of the most important decisions parents make. I’m committed to making it easier for families to access as many high-quality and flexible options as possible. Great options are out there, but nothing offers easy comparisons of reviews, costs and types of childcare available. When the perfect digital solution is found, parents will wonder how on earth they coped without it. Michelle Heaton said: I’m a busy mum of 2, juggling a career and have a husband that works full time. We don’t have family close by to help so childcare I can rely on is vital. Having a simple app that I can access on my phone would be really helpful to me and many other busy parents. We all need help sometimes but we need to know that our child is well cared for if we can’t be there 24/7. It would be great to have all the information we need in one place, easy to access - especially if you’ve got 2 kids running around. The report called for an improvement to information that’s available to parents, including proposing a central site to bring together key information in an easily accessible digital format clearly signposting parents to the information they need. The competition is being run with Innovate UK through the Small Business Research Initiative ( SBRI ) - a scheme which enables public sector bodies to connect with innovative ideas and technology businesses. Technology has changed the way we shop, travel and get around. Similarly when the perfect digital solution for childcare is discovered, people will wonder how on earth they coped without it.

/government/news/qualifications-are-key-to-high-quality-early-years-education,"Equipping staff with the right skills is the key to ensuring better quality early years education - this is the finding of Professor Cathy Nutbrown’s independent Review of Early Education and Childcare Qualifications , which was published today. In her independent report, ‘Foundations for Quality’, Professor Nutbrown sets out 19 recommendations to improve the skills and knowledge of those who work with young children. The report’s other recommendations include: Improving qualifications to make them more rigorous and demanding, with a stronger focus on child development. A focus on improving the delivery of qualifications so that tutors have the support to improve their skills and maintain the current experience of the sector. Asking the early years sector to lead on mentoring new staff, to support them as they enter work and make sure students learn from good practice. Build on progress to encourage graduate leadership in the sector, through Early Years Professional Status, as part of the move towards more teachers in the early years. That the Government should not impose a licensing system for the sector at this stage. Professor Cathy Nutbrown said: I have seen many inspirational examples of dedicated staff providing the best environment for playing and learning. I want more young children to benefit from this. Every child deserves excellent early education and care, and every parent should be confident that their child is getting the best. Early education and care needs to support babies’ and young children’s all round well being and development. That is why I want the workforce to really understand child development, the importance of play, and have good English and maths skills. There is no doubt that high quality education is important. We need to make sure the early years workforce has the necessary skills, qualifications and experience to provide the very best for our young children. My recommendations stress quality in ensuring that staff are as good as they can be, and have the skills, knowledge, and understanding to make the most of the government’s investment in the early years. Working in the early years sector should be a recognised and fulfilling career that attracts the best women and men. There cannot be a compromise on quality and we must be relentless in our desire to improve experience for young children. Taken together, I believe my recommendations will give parents and the early years workforce confidence in the standards of early education and care qualifications. The report shows that high quality early years provision narrows the gap between disadvantaged children and others, and that staff qualifications improve quality. The government will now carefully consider Professor Nutbrown’s recommendations before publishing a response later this year. Children’s Minister Sarah Teather said: This government wants the best for our young people. It is clear that if children are to have the best start in life, then they must have excellent early education. The evidence that disadvantaged children particularly benefit from quality early education is compelling. This is why we are offering free childcare to hundreds of two year olds across the country. I warmly welcome Professor Nutbrown’s thoughtful and thorough report. It takes a careful and measured look at the sector, and will be very useful in helping us to shape the future of the early years workforce. We need to attract bright people to the sector so that our young children get the best possible start in life - after all, they only get one chance. Parents want to be sure that the childcare they use is both high quality and affordable. The review of childcare affordability announced by the Prime Minister will be informed by Professor Nutbrown’s report, for example her suggestion to look at the link between better qualified staff and child : staff ratios. We will now consider her report very carefully before responding in further detail later this year. This comes as the Prime Minister has today launched a commission on childcare which will look at how to reduce the costs to families and the burdens on childcare providers. This will explore the effectiveness of current government support and look at how to encourage childcare after school and in the holidays. It will draw widely on expertise and evidence from within this country and abroad and it will report back in the autumn. Anne Longfield, Chief Executive of 4Children , said: 4Children is delighted to welcome the recommendations set out in Professor Nutbrown’s review. The clear commitment to delivering the highest quality for our youngest children speaks strongly to the overwhelming evidence showing how crucial the foundation stage is to the social, emotional, cognitive and health outcomes of children. If implemented, I believe that this review has the potential to lead to a radical change in the early years and childcare support on offer to children and their families in this country - increasing training and skills for workers with challenging and rewarding job opportunities. This report puts forward informed and insightful recommendations to provide the high quality workforce needed to ensure children - especially those with the most disadvantages get the best start possible. Today 4children is launching a summary of the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) for parents. This has been developed with parents and the Department for Education to ensure parents know what the EYFS is about and what they can expect from the professionals working with their child. It was developed following a recommendation from Dame Claire Tickell’s review of the EYFS, that parents should be provided with a brief, simple explanation of what the EYFS is and what they can expect. Notes to editors The Professor Nutbrown Review of Early Education and Childcare Qualifications is online at http://www.education.gov.uk/nutbrownreview .

/hmrc-internal-manuals/business-income-manual/bim52751,"Childminders work in their own homes and are paid by parents for looking after their children, often while the parents are at work. Profits from childminding are usually chargeable to Income Tax as trade profits, although some occasional childminders’ profits may be chargeable as miscellaneous income. Many childminders are members of the Professional Association for Childcare and Early Years (PACEY), formerly known as the National Childminding Association (NCMA). HMRC entered into an agreement with the NCMA on the expenses that will be allowed as deductions from childminding income. Childminders, whether members of PACEY or not, may calculate their expenses using the NCMA/HMRC agreement. Their statutory rights are not affected by the agreement. Childminders may calculate their profits on the normal basis if they wish to do so. And from April 2013, the simplified expenses rules offer a further alternative method of calculating certain expenses (see BIM75000 onwards). In calculating any taxable profits, HMRC allow as deductions from childminding income expenses which are reasonable in amount and which are directly attributable to childminding. The cash book and attendance register produced by PACEY provides an acceptable way of recording income and outgoings. Receipts are not required for items costing less than £10. Receipts are required if a number of smaller items are purchased at one time and the total cost is £10 or more.  Household expenditure The agreement is based on the hours that childminders work and not on the number of children they care for. A childminder looking after a child on a full time basis for 40 or more hours each week is entitled to claim the full time proportion of expenses. How this works is illustrated in the following table: Hours worked % of Heating and lighting costs % of Water rates, Council Tax and Rent       10 8% 2% 15 12% 4% 20 17% 5% 25 21% 6% 30 25% 7% 35 29% 9% 40 (full time) 33% 10% The full time figures shown in the table should be scaled down from depending on hours worked. Wear and tear of household furnishings A deduction of 10% of total childminding income may be made to cover the wear and tear of furniture and household items. This is intended to include household items which are not used wholly and exclusively in childminding. A childminder claiming this deduction may not, however, claim relief for the cost of replacing such household items. Reasonable costs of cleaning household items where the need for cleaning is as a result of childminding activities may be allowed as a separate item. The agreement also covers the following expenditure: Food and drink Reasonable estimates for the costs of food and drink provided for the children being cared for are acceptable and receipts are not required. Car expenses Where appropriate, childminders can use the simplified expenses mileage rates. However, if the childminder wishes, the actual cost of car expenses for childminding purposes can be claimed instead. Other costs Also allowable - the cost of toys, outings, books, safety equipment, stationary, travel fares, membership fees or subscriptions to your childminding organisation, public liability insurance premiums and the actual cost of telephone use for childminding purposes. Grants Grants received by childminders to help them to start up their businesses or to meet capital or running costs should be dealt with following normal principles, see BIM40450 onwards. If a grant is received before the business begins to trade, it is not a trade receipt. A start up grant may reduce the amount of pre-trading expenditure on which relief is available, see BIM46355 ."
/government/publications/exploring-the-flexibility-of-the-free-entitlement-to-early-education-research-among-parents,"All 3- and 4-year-olds are entitled to 15 hours per week of free early education for 38 weeks of the year (known as the free entitlement). Children become eligible for the free hours from 1 September, 1 January or 1 April (the start of term) following their 3rd birthday. They remain eligible until they reach compulsory school age (the term following their 5th birthday, though in practice most children now start school before this). Free early education places are available at a range of early years settings, including nursery schools and classes, children’s centres, day nurseries, playgroups, pre-schools and certain registered childminders. There are a number of parameters set by the Department for Education within which the free entitlement provision operates. These parameters set the framework within which local authorities should provide the free entitlement (eg the minimum and maximum number of hours per day, the number of days on which the free hours should be taken, the restrictions on start and finish times, and the number of providers who can be involved in delivering free hours to a child)."
/government/speeches/parents-eligible-for-more-than-8000-in-childcare-support,"Thank you John [Bingham] for that very kind introduction - it’s a great pleasure to be here, kicking off what sounds like a really exciting day. As a parent to a 6-month-old son myself, I’d love to stay and hear your speakers’ thoughts on innovation in the childcare sector but as I’m sure many of you will know so well yourselves, juggling work and family life can make for some very busy weeks! And sometimes it can seem like these weeks are getting ever-more hectic. There are always more demands on our time - there’s always more to get done in the same number of hours. And no wonder. There’s been a seismic shift in the way the family unit works over recent decades. There are 14.4 million women in work today - up 60% since the early 1970s. Around two-thirds of mothers in the UK now work. And that means that dual-income couples are now the norm. No-one could deny that this is a good thing for our economy, for the future of our country. But it does mean there have been some pretty big changes in the way we care for our children. With both parents working, and perhaps less able to rely on family and friends for support than in the past, I know that some families have found it a real challenge to get the right childcare provision for their children. And believe me, as a new father, I’m coming to realise myself just how important that provision is! Because with ever-increasing evidence about the impact early education can have on the rest of your child’s time at school, childcare is about much more than somewhere to leave your child where they’ll be safe and happy. It’s also about their development, and their future. I’m speaking here to an audience of practitioners and providers, but I have no doubt that many of you will have your own children. So you’ll know exactly what parents are looking for when they consider you as their childcare option. They’re looking for a safe and experienced pair of hands. They’re looking for a provider that offers hours that work for them. They’re looking for good value - childcare costs shouldn’t be a barrier to a parent returning to work, if that’s what’s best for their family. So, I believe, there are 2 big questions here. What is the government doing to help hard-working parents, and how are we making sure that childcare provides the best value for money? What money is the government providing to back up this plan? This government is spending £5 billion - rising to £6 billion - a year on childcare over the course of this Parliament. But our commitment doesn’t end there. We’re putting in even more money: almost another £1.5 billion to make sure that the families that need it most benefit from the government’s help to support their children. These numbers are huge. And they prove that the childcare sector is - quite rightly - seeing a place in the forefront of the political arena that it hasn’t always benefitted from in the past. What does our plan mean for parents and families? But I know that for parents, it doesn’t matter that the government is pumping billions into the sector. What matters are the childcare bills at the beginning of the month - what matters is the amount of money they have left over after paying for the essentials to enjoy life with their family. That’s why I’m delighted to be able to say that, after years of ever-rising prices, the costs of childcare in England have stabilised for the first time in over a decade. And there’s more support than ever before for parents. The entitlement to free childcare for 3- and 4-year-olds has increased from 12-and-a-half hours a week to 15. With government help, those families also eligible for funded childcare for their 2-year-olds save around £2,300 by getting the first 15 hours a week free, too. And parents on working tax credits can also claim back against additional hours, saving them up to an additional £6,370 a year. Of course, more and more people are choosing different forms of employment - not everyone works 9 to 5 for the same employer anymore. Plenty of parents choose to work independently, or to set up their own small business. That’s why we’re extending tax-free childcare to parents who are self-employed, or whose employers don’t offer employer-supported childcare. So all of this means that there’s now near-universal provision for 3- and 4-year-olds. And, if parents decide working more hours is right for them, the government is putting in more money to make sure that working remains a viable option. But what does this actually mean for an average family in England today? A working couple with one 3-year-old, earning a middle income, could be facing bills of £8,000 a year for childcare if they didn’t receive any help from the government. I don’t know about you, but many parents in this situation would have to think very carefully about the possibility of them both going back to work, only for a huge chunk of their paycheques to disappear on childcare costs. But, thanks to this government’s reforms, that same working family is currently entitled to 570 free hours of early education, covering almost a third of the 2,000 hours they would otherwise need to fund to work full time for the year. And, when tax-free childcare is introduced in autumn 2015, the government will pay for a further 20% of childcare costs per child, capped at £2,000 a year, and benefiting 2 million families with children up to 12 years of age. All of this means that the government is funding 43% of this family’s yearly childcare costs. They’re almost 3-and-a-half grand better off with our support. That’s a sizeable chunk towards a house deposit - it’s a new car, or it’s simply an extra few hundred pounds a month towards enjoying life. For a working couple with one 3-year-old on a low income, support through working tax credits means the government is currently funding 79% of their childcare costs - that’s over £6,000 a year. To those families who want to get on and work but worry that it doesn’t make financial sense for them, that’s a huge help. It’s a saving of over £500 every single month. And, of course, the above figures would also apply to single parents working full-time. But it won’t help families if we don’t get the message out there. That’s why today marks the start of a major campaign by the Department for Education to do just that. By reaching out through Facebook , Twitter and family information services across the country, we’ll be showing parents exactly what government support for childcare means for them - the cash value of the hours their 2-, 3- and 4-year-olds get for free. Setting the sector a challenge So I know that some would say we’re not doing enough to help. Some would say we need to throw even more money at the sector, offer even more free hours to parents. But I think we can all agree that £5 billion is a pretty substantial sum. And that at the moment we’re all having to work hard to make our money go further. So that’s where you, the providers, come in. You’ll all have heard the naysayers - the ones who say week in, week out, that the sector is in crisis. That it’s crumbling under the pressure. But I know that’s just not true. You’re already rising to the challenge of the massive social shift I mentioned earlier. And put simply, the sector is thriving. There are more registered places in full-day care settings, more places in the most deprived areas. And there aren’t many countries in which over 90% of 3- and 4-year-olds are enrolled in early education! But I know it hasn’t always been easy so far. Many of you have told me that you’re having problems with funding, particularly around rates for free entitlement. And lots of parents have told me that they’re still worrying about high costs, when all they should be worrying about is making the best choice for their child. It seems to me that the question isn’t about how much money we have, but how we use it. How we make it work for parents and providers. For our part, we’re working hard to make the current system simpler and maximising the amount of money that actually reaches the front line. We’ve protected the amount of funding local authorities receive for 2-, 3- and 4-year-olds in their area for the next financial year. And we’ve recently published a benchmarking tool, allowing providers to see how early years funding works in their area; how much of this money their councils keep, and how much makes its way to providers, schools and - ultimately - children. But I think that innovation has to be led by those that know the sector best. I urge all of you to ask yourselves, honestly, if there’s anything you could be doing differently, more innovatively, to make the funding you get go further. We’re doing all we can to encourage enterprise and imagination - encouraging local authorities to be more flexible through our revised statutory guidance, issued a couple of months ago. Already I know there are some superb examples of innovation across the country. A new nursery in Waltham Forest has found accommodation in previously run-down and unused community buildings. And they’re making extra money by letting out this space in the evenings and weekends to other local groups. Parklands Day Nursery in Kirkby used a grant from their local authority to redesign their building space to create 24 new places for 2-year-olds. But I want to see you go further. I want parents across the country to make the right choices for their families without having to worry that the cost or availability of childcare provision in their area might be a problem. I want you to consider offering wrap-around provision and holiday care - stepping up, with the support of your councils, to offer care for 50 or 51 weeks of the year, rather than just in term times. I want you to work together with schools to offer parents joined-up support that will make their lives that bit easier. Or perhaps, like we so often see in the private sector, coming up with new models that increase profits, but also work around parents’ changing lives, delivering real value for money. Like The Baby Drop, in Clapham, that allows parents to leave children for a short period of time, on a flexible basis, while they go to the gym, pop into the office or go food shopping. In a nutshell, I want you to use the billions of pounds in the system to innovate, break new ground, do things differently. And offer parents care for their children that is affordable. Convenient. And above all, of a really high quality. And I’ve got confidence that you can. Because when I look around the room today, I see a group of people - small business owners, entrepreneurs, people who are passionate about giving children the best possible start in life - all of whom have the skills and experience to think radically and raise the bar. As I said in my speech to the Nursery World Conference just a couple of weeks ago, we all have a moral mission to get this right. And if government and the sector can work together, if we can use the money we have to provide pioneering new provision for children, if we can continue to save working families thousands of pounds every single year, then I know we can do it. Thank you for everything that you do. Enjoy the rest of your day."
/government/publications/a-comparison-of-international-childcare-systems,"The effect of early education as a strategy in enhancing children’s educational outcomes and countering socio-economic disadvantage has been well documented. Recent evidence reveals that the potential of the system to make a difference to children’s lives is fundamentally affected by certain important systemic and structural aspects of early education provision. Yet, at present the way that these structural elements effect the longer term educational achievement of children is not well understood. This paper examines how 15 OECD countries plus the UK have responded to the challenge of implementing a set of structural mechanisms within their early education systems and how far these can be seen to be related to enhanced educational attainment for children."
/government/news/review-of-early-years-foundation-stage,"Children’s Minister Sarah Teather today asked Dame Clare Tickell, Chief Executive of Action for Children, to carry out a review of the early years foundation stage (EYFS) so that it is less bureaucratic and more focused on young children’s learning and development. Ministers are concerned that the EYFS framework is currently too rigid and puts too many burdens on the early years workforce, which has led to some of the workforce saying they are spending less time with children, and more time ticking boxes. The government has asked Dame Clare, a children and families expert, to make sure the standards that support young children’s learning are based on the best and latest research on children’s development. They want to shift the focus to getting children ready for education and to increasing the attainment of children from deprived backgrounds. The review will cover four main areas: scope of regulation - whether there should be 1 single framework for all early years providers learning and development - looking at the latest evidence about children’s development and what is needed to give them the best start at school assessment - whether young children’s development should be formally assessed at a certain age, and what this should cover welfare - the minimum standards to keep children safe and support their healthy development Children’s Minister Sarah Teather said: I am always impressed by the dedication of professionals who are working hard to give young children the best start in life. They play a vital role in helping children from all backgrounds to have a good start in school and reach their full potential. Professionals deserve to have the freedom to do their jobs and not have to deal with unnecessary bureaucracy. It is not right or fair that children from deprived backgrounds that do really well in their early years are overtaken by lower achieving children from advantaged backgrounds by age five. We need good quality early learning for all children and a framework that raises standards, as well as keeping children safe. Through this review we want to hear about what is and isn’t working well in the EYFS. We also need to create a fairer and more flexible childcare market that is responsive to parents and the rising numbers of children in childcare settings. I am delighted that Clare has agreed to lead this important review. Her knowledge of the needs of children and families, especially those from more disadvantaged areas, as well as the importance of early intervention, means she is well placed to assess the best way to support young children, and free up the system so that it works for both childcare workers and parents. Dame Clare Tickell, Chief executive of Action for Children, said: There has been a lot of debate in recent years about what young children should be learning before they reach school, and the pressure and burdens this puts on the early years sector. It is important that professionals in the early years sector have the time to tackle the important issues - helping children from poorer backgrounds, and those with special needs, as well as giving all children a fun and stimulating learning experience. I look forward to conducting this review and to listening to professionals, parents, carers and early years experts. I hope to find a way forward that supports the different approaches to learning and development, so that we have some of the best early years standards in the world. The coalition government is committed to investing in the early years, and recently announced the extension of free childcare for all 3- and 4-year-olds to 15 hours a week. The review of the EYFS will ensure that good quality early learning benefits all children, as the government believes this can make a real difference to success in later life. It also has a more significant impact for children from disadvantaged backgrounds. Dame Clare will provide a final report in spring 2011. The government will then consult on any proposed changes before they take effect from September 2012. Notes to editors: Watch the video concerning the announcement. Sarah Teather discusses the review of the Early Years Foundation Stage Watch the video of Children’s Minister Sarah Teather visiting a school in Newham as part of the launch of the EYFS review. Sarah Teather visits St Matthew’s pre-school in Newham The EYFS has been statutory since 2008 and sets standards in learning and welfare for any provider caring for children aged 0 to 5 years. The framework was introduced in response to research that highlighted how good quality childcare can support children’s learning and development. The current early years framework is split into 2 parts. The first part sets out learning and development requirements. The second part is the welfare requirements, which set out what early years providers must do to keep children safe, promote their welfare, and ensure the suitability of adults, premises, the environment and equipment. Early years providers may apply for exemptions or modifications from the learning and development requirements where they are temporarily unable to deliver the full learning and development requirements, or where a majority of parents agree with the provider’s assessment that an exemption is required because the established principle which governs their practice conflicts with elements of the EYFS learning and development requirements.

/government/news/755-million-to-double-free-childcare-offer-for-2-year-olds,"Councils are to receive £755 million of government funding to provide 15 hours a week of free childcare for the most disadvantaged 2-year-olds from September next year. Today’s money will double the number of children eligible for free early learning from 130,000 children to over 260,000 - around 40% of 2-year-olds - equipping them with the vital skills they need to be successful in life. A new online guide, also launched today, will enable parents and providers to see how many 2-year-olds in their local area are eligible for free places, right down to their postcode. This will encourage existing childcare providers to expand and encourage new entrants into the market - creating greater choice and flexibility for parents and making it easier for them to access the childcare and early education services they need. Announcing the new funding, Education and Childcare Minister Elizabeth Truss has urged councils to use the money to make the best use of their existing facilities - such as school nurseries and childminders - to increase the number of high quality places which offer childcare from 8am to 6pm and fit with the demands of modern, working life. The Deputy Prime Minister, Nick Clegg, said: I want to give children the best possible start in life to get them ready to learn, progress, and aim high. All too often a child’s journey in life can be mapped out for them before they’ve even set foot in the classroom. That’s why investing in early education for children will give them the chance to start school on an equal footing with their peers. From September 2014, the number of 2-year-olds who receive free childcare will double, giving 260,000 children access to high-quality childcare that can make a real impact to their lives. Parents, local authorities, nurseries and childminders should all be taking the opportunity to take up the offer their children are entitled to, make sure places are available and expand local childcare provision. Every child deserves the chance to get ahead and get on in life, regardless of their background, financial situation or family set-up. This £755 million will help even more children and families. Education and Childcare Minister, Elizabeth Truss, said: More than 260,000 2-year-olds will be eligible for early education - a massive increase on the 20,000 children accessing free early learning in 2010. I want parents to get the early years support their child is entitled to where they want it and at a time they need it. They would be able to access childcare in blocks of 3 or 5 hours to suit their working lives. Encouraging school nurseries to open from 8am to 6pm rather than 9am to 3pm and passing on funding to good and outstanding childminders will help offer places at the times we know parents need them. We have already made it easier for childminders to access funding for 2-year-olds, and I want councils to pass more money down so parents are able to access the home-based flexible childcare that many prefer. The government wants to increase the number of places for disadvantaged 2-year-olds, while expanding childcare and early years provision in ways which make it easier for families to find childcare and early years education that works for them and makes the best use of facilities locally. We want to see more schools expanding their nursery provision and delivering the fully funded early education places for 2-year-olds, as well as offering additional hours of childcare at an affordable cost to parents. We also want to see more good and outstanding childminders providing free places for 2-year-olds. We have recently improved access to funding so good and outstanding childminders are automatically able to offer funded places - increasing the number eligible from 4,000 to 32,000. Today’s funding will be provided to local authorities at a national average rate of £5.09, adjusted for the area’s average costs. This compares favourably to the Daycare Trust (now Family and Childcare Trust) Cost Survey 2013 which showed that the average hourly childcare fee in England was £4.26 per hour for children aged 2 and over, and will enable good and outstanding schools, nurseries and childminders to provide high-quality early learning. Figures published recently reveal that within just 1 month of this year’s scheme being launched, over 90,000 children are already benefitting from the scheme - a huge increase on the 20,000 children accessing early education in 2010. Parents also benefit from greater flexibility in how they split their 15 hours, and are able to take blocks over 2 or 3 days rather than 3 hours per day for 5 days. In future, funding to councils will be based on a ‘use it or lose it’ basis, meaning the number of participating children will determine the amount of funding they get. Where parents are not taking up the places, local authorities will get less money. Notes to Editors Details of the funding breakdown for the 2-year-old early education programme for lower income households for the 2014 to 2015 financial year . Take a look at the new online guide which allows parents and providers to see how many 2-year-olds are eligible for free places in their area on the allocations page. The government is allocating funding at an average hourly rate of £5.09 per child for the statutory 2-year-old places. According to the Daycare Trust Childcare Costs Survey 2012, the average hourly rate for childcare fees in England is £4.13 per hour for under 2s.

/government/speeches/nursery-world-column-from-sarah-teather-on-funding-for-sure-start-childrens-centres,"It’s hard to switch on the television or open a newspaper at the moment without hearing or seeing the reality of difficult funding decisions being faced by local authorities. As both a minister and a constituency MP, I have spoken to many parents and professionals about their local children’s centre services and it’s heartening that people value these services so highly. Let me say once more that this Government is committed to the early years. We have ensured there is enough money in the system through the new Early Intervention Grant (EIG) to retain the network of children’s centres and there is already a Bill in Parliament which will make a reality of our commitment to extend free early education to all disadvantaged 2-year-olds. As you know, this Government has an overall vision for public services that are locally led and locally accountable. This is no less true for the early years. That means we need to find the best ways to put people like you in charge. You have witnessed - and in many cases led and shaped - huge changes to early learning and care, and the expectations of parents and the public. But this has taken place in the context of significant central Government prescription. We now want to approach things differently and work more closely with you to ensure your knowledge and expertise informs us from the start. I know I don’t need to persuade you of the argument that intervening early makes sense socially, morally and financially. Nowhere is this more true than in the early stages of children’s development. We have to keep reviewing and refreshing what we do and how we do it in response to changing pressures, knowledge and evidence. A new policy statement, to be published later in the year, will explain the context and set out our vision for reform. We want a system led by the professionals who understand how best to deliver services through pregnancy and up to the age of five, and for this reason we want you and others from the sector to drive the strategic vision. Our approach is a genuine partnership, signalling the start of a longer-term shift to a new way of working. This is what we are calling ‘co-production’, and I have already brought together a group of individuals to think about our collective purpose, and sustainable, national, leadership, as well as specific issues of policy. My hope is that this steering group will help me and my officials develop a better way to achieve our shared goals, and define that new way of working for the future. I am determined that focusing on this ambition does not distract us from our current challenges. We know the crucial role high-quality children’s centres play, locally in improving the lives of the individuals and families who use and love them, and nationally in reducing inequalities, intervening early to tackle problems before they become crises, and raising overall health and education outcomes. The EIG is designed to give local authorities the freedom to act more strategically and target investment early, to have the greatest impact. Local leaders and managers are considering their budgets for next year and I want to see decisions based on local knowledge, expertise, and consultation with their communities. I’m really encouraged that in recent weeks increasing numbers of local authorities have made the public commitment that they will not close children’s centres - for example in Hertfordshire and Devon. Through reducing management costs, recommissioning services more efficiently and better strategic planning with local health services, local authorities are proving that innovative approaches can keep centres open and maintain services. We must not lose sight of the fact that the most important people are the families and children using these services. I know this is a view shared by everyone working with children, and I thank you for your passion and ongoing commitment to making sure we ensure every child has the best possible start in life."
/government/news/early-learning-and-childrens-centres-government-sets-out-reform,"A new, slimmed down early years curriculum for 0-5-year-olds, more focused on making sure children start school ready and able to learn, will be introduced next year under changes set out today by Children’s Minister Sarah Teather. Responding to the Tickell Review of the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS), the new framework radically reduces the number of early learning goals from 69 to 17. It focuses on three prime areas of learning critical to making sure children develop healthily and happily. These areas form the foundations on which children can then master the basic literacy skills they need for school. Parents will also get much clearer information on how their children are doing with the introduction of a new progress check for every two-year-old in early education. Parents and professionals can be confident children are developing well and any problems will be picked up early. As part of wider reforms to Sure Start Children’s Centres and early learning, the Government is looking at ways to get parents and communities more involved in running children’s centres. New plans to be consulted on will also make it easier for parents to plan and balance their working lives by making the free entitlement to 15 hours of early learning and childcare more flexible. In addition, the Government has made £3million available this year for up to 30 local areas to trial payment by results in children’s centres. The trials will look at how to reward local authorities and centres on how well they reach and support the most vulnerable families to narrow gaps in child development, raise attainment at the end of the foundation years and improve family health and wellbeing. The key proposals outlined today include: A new focus on three prime areas of learning in the EYFS so children are ready and able to learn at school. These areas are: personal, social and emotional development, physical development and communication and language. A slimmed down EYFS, cutting the number of learning goals from 69-17. The learning goals will be more closely aligned with Key Stage 1 to smooth the transition from reception class to Year 1. Assessment at age five will remain but instead of the current complicated scale point assessment children will be judged against 17 learning goals. A new check for every two-year-old in pre-school settings to pick up early any problems in a child’s development or special educational needs. Going further than Tickell’s recommendation, the Government will require all early years settings to provide this information to parents. New plans, to be consulted on in the autumn, to enable parents to access their free entitlement hours from 7am-7pm, and take the full 15 hours over two days rather than a minimum of three days. A new core purpose for children’s centres, with a stronger focus on school readiness and supporting families. It clearly sets out the outcomes which children’s centres should be supporting. Exploring how we can find new ways of running children’s centres, such as mutuals and co-operative approaches, so parents and communities can be more involved in local decision making and services. New requirement on all local authorities to publish data on how much they are spending on children’s centres in their area to improve local accountability. Children’s Minister Sarah Teather said: The first five years of a child’s life, the foundation years, are absolutely critical. We want a system where every child can thrive, regardless of their social background. If we are to tackle the attainment gap and raise life chances, we must start in the earliest years. We know experiences in these first years have the biggest impact on how a child’s brain develops. It’s when children grasp the fundamental skills needed to do well at school and develop as happy, confident individuals. That’s why today I am setting out a much slimmer, easier to understand early years curriculum. It will give professionals more freedom in how they work with children, and will involve parents more in their child’s learning. Fundamentally, it will make sure we are preparing our children for the challenges of school and beyond. This isn’t just about making sure they can hold a pencil - children need the resilience, confidence and personal skills to be able to learn. Children’s centres are where much of this work takes place. We want them to be places where communities come together, parents can support each other and children can develop. That’s why we are looking at how to give parents more say in the running of their local children’s centre. This could be through governing bodies, or a co-operative approach where parents are involved in day to day decisions. We are also providing £3million this year for up to 30 new pilots where local councils will be paid for the results they achieve. Finally, we want to make sure parents get the help and support they need to bring up their children and balance work and family life. Proposed changes to the free entitlement hours will help make sure more children can benefit from early education and parents can juggle their working hours more effectively. Dame Clare Tickell published her independent review of the Early Years Foundation Stage in March this year. The Government agrees with Tickell that the current system is overly bureaucratic, repetitive and not as parent friendly as it should be. The revised framework is published today on the Department’s website. Evidence shows that making a difference to children’s achievement in the early years is critical. Pupils who start off in the bottom 20 per cent of attainment at the EYFS profile aged five are six times more likely to be in the bottom 20 per cent at Key Stage 1. Feinstein’s research shows that parental interest in their child’s education has four times more influence on attainment by age 16 than socio-economic background. The new framework will free up professionals to spend more time working with children helping them to develop and the new two-year-old check will ensure parents are properly engaged in their child’s development. The Government’s reform of children’s centres and the EYFS is part of wider work on a new vision for Families in the Foundation Years. More detail on how the Government plans to support parents will be published in the next few weeks. Dame Clare Tickell said: I am very pleased that the Government has accepted the recommendations of my review in such a comprehensive way. As well as the agreement to slim down the bureaucracy, I know that the decision to support my recommendation for a check for all two-year-olds will make a real difference. We now have a golden opportunity to identify not only any potential developmental and special educational needs children have, but crucially to help parents who need additional support too. The earliest years in a child’s life provide the foundation for everything that follows. We must make sure that children are supported and encouraged to achieve their full potential as inquisitive, confident and secure individuals. Anand Shukla, acting Chief executive of Daycare Trust commented: We warmly welcome today’s government announcement on the free early years entitlement, which Daycare Trust has recommended for some time. Our research shows that while there are currently high levels of take up of the free entitlement, many families do not use the whole 15 hours of free education and care that they are entitled to, because it does not fit with parents’ working patterns. We also know that there is a huge gap in childcare provision for parents working outside of typical 8am-6pm hours. By allowing the free entitlement to be used over a minimum of two days rather than three, and from 7am-7pm, both parents and children stand to benefit. The introduction of, and ongoing commitment to, the free early years entitlement has been one the most important family-friendly policies in recent years and we are pleased to see the government continue to build upon this very successful policy. These proposed changes, if adopted, will bring substantial benefits to the lives of hard-pressed families across the country. Notes to editors The revised Early Years Foundation Stage Framework (EYFS) has been published for consultation on this website. The new framework will be implemented from September 2012. The new core purpose of children’s centres , published today for consultation, sets out the Government’s overall goal for children’s centres, and draws on the views of experts in the sector to set out how children’s centres can achieve this. The core purpose of children’s centres is: Child development and school readiness - supporting communication, emotional, physical and social development so children start school confident and able to learn. Parenting aspirations and parenting skills - helping parents to maximise their skills and give their children the best start. Child and family health and life chances - promoting good physical and mental health for children and their parents, including addressing risk factors early on. The Government extended the free entitlement for all three- and four-year-olds to 15 hours a week from September last year. From 2013, all disadvantaged two-year-olds will benefit. The Government will be consulting on changes to the flexibility of the free entitlement in the autumn. Local authorities who will be taking part in the Payment by Results trials will be announced in the summer, alongside the criteria they will be measured against. The Government wants to use payment by results as an incentive for areas to focus on the new proposed core purpose of children’s centres, to improve child development and school readiness among young children and to reduce inequalities. There is a wealth of research available that supports investment in the early years and how critical those first 5 years are for children’s development and future success.

/government/news/ofsteds-childrens-services-annual-rating-process-to-end,"In a letter to Ofsted, the Association of Directors of Children’s Services, the Local Government Association (LGA), and Solace, Children’s Minister Tim Loughton today outlined the decision to end the annual rating process as soon as a suitable legislative opportunity can be identified. Across local authorities there has been a common concern that in its current form the annual ratings adds little understanding of children’s services in an area over and above the individual inspections that underlie it, and are not particularly helpful in aiding improvement. The decision is also in line with wider changes to local authority accountability arrangements across Government and the termination of the Comprehensive Area Assessment. The department will work with Ofsted in the meantime to ensure the rating process is as simple and transparent as possible and does not create unnecessary burdens for local areas. The department is working alongside Ofsted to consider potential changes to aspects of the wider children’s services inspection framework, in line with the drive for greater local accountability and freedoms. This needs to be informed by any relevant findings and recommendations from the review of child protection currently being conducted by Professor Eileen Munro and the review of early years by Dame Clare Tickell. We hope to be able to announce decisions on these changes during the first half of next year. Further information Ofsted carries out a review every year of the overall performance of each local authority in England as regards the delivery of children’s services. It then awards each authority a performance rating in respect of the matters reviewed. This duty is set out in the Education and Inspections Act 2006. LA inspections of safeguarding and looked after children are carried out every three years unless there are particular concerns about performance. The annual rating provides a simple summary of the outcomes of the inspections of services and settings carried out by Ofsted during the year and an analysis of the performance data related to that authority. Ratings are awarded on a four-point scale: (1) performs poorly (2) performs adequately (3) performs well (4) performs excellently. The 2010 ratings are: performs excellently - 20 local authorities (compared to 10 in 2009) performing well - 77 (93 in 2009) performing adequately - 37 (40 in 2009) performing poorly - 12 (9 in 2009). Six local authorities have yet to receive their annual rating, as Ofsted is awaiting the outcome of inspections of safeguarding and looked after children services in these authorities. The Government has already announced the termination of the Comprehensive Area Assessment (CAA), of which the Ofsted annual rating previously formed part. [Contact:997]"

/government/news/too-few-pupils-develop-creativity-through-confident-drawing,"An Ofsted report launched today looking at art, craft and design education in schools and colleges has found that after getting off to a confident early start, pupils’ progress slowed during primary school and was no better than satisfactory at the start of secondary school. The report, ‘Making a mark: art, craft and design 2008-2011’ , shows that weaknesses in the teaching of drawing have not been addressed since Ofsted’s last report. Too few pupils developed creativity through confident drawing. Limited provision for teachers’ professional development meant that less than a quarter of teachers surveyed participated in subject-specific training in the year before their inspection. Only 2 out of 5 primary schools and 3 out of 5 secondary schools provided good or better education in art, craft and design, the main short coming with the remainder being inconsistency in provision. The report says that opportunities available out of school, such as visits to art galleries, are not made clear enough to pupils, parents and carers. It recommends that these opportunities and other good practice should be accessible to all. Ofsted Director of Education, Jean Humphrys, said: Children’s ability to appreciate and interpret what they observe, communicate what they think and feel, or make what they imagine and invent, is influenced by the quality of their art, craft and design education. We found that children often began well, drawing adventurously and imaginatively at the very start of their education, but too few made consistently good enough progress to flourish creatively, especially boys. This was masked by their enjoyment of the subject even when teaching was barely satisfactory. I would like to see teachers getting better access to professional development. I want schools to build on pupils’ experiences and creative development in their early years more effectively in primary and secondary school. The quality of the curriculum had improved since Ofsted’s previous survey. The schools inspected for the report typically had broadened curriculum provision to promote greater inclusion. The best work inspectors saw in schools and colleges was characterised by a breadth of drawing media used for a range of purposes such as recording, experimenting, analysing, and developing ideas. They found that good skills in drawing, a fundamental subject skill, underpinned good achievement in later secondary school and post-16 education. An increase in photography courses and crafts-based approaches had improved boys’ participation and achievement. For example, in 11 of the 86 secondary schools visited, photography courses had improved boys’ participation and performance. But there is still more to do to close the gap with girls’ high attainment in the subject. In the 14 schools and nine colleges visited where provision was outstanding, best practice was promoted by energetic subject leaders who ensured that the exciting world of art, craft and design was reflected in and beyond the classroom. Their impact was reflected in work in art galleries; self-motivated pupils, outside lessons, strong teamwork, vibrant displays and challenging exhibitions of work. Notes to editors The report, ‘Making a mark: art, craft and design 2008-2011’ , is online. It evaluates the strengths and weaknesses of art, craft and design education in schools and colleges in England. It is based principally on subject inspections of 96 primary schools, 90 secondary schools and seven special schools between 2008 and 2011. This includes five visits in each phase to focus on an aspect of good practice. The report also draws on institutional inspections, 69 subject inspections in colleges, and visits to a sample of art galleries. Part A focuses on the key inspection findings in the context of the continued popularity of the subject with pupils and students. Part B considers how well the concerns about inclusion, creativity and drawing raised in Ofsted’s 2008 report, ‘Drawing together: art, craft and design in schools’ , have been addressed. Since the Education Reform Act of 1988, art, craft and design (referred to as art and design in the National Curriculum), along with the other foundation subjects, has been compulsory for all pupils from ages 5 to 14 in maintained schools. The requirement to teach the full National Curriculum in foundation subjects was suspended in 1998 to increase the focus on English and mathematics in primary schools. Since 2000, when the suspension was removed, all primary schools have been required to teach the full National Curriculum in all subjects. [Contact:2325]"

The main points from the latest release are: In January 2013, the number of 3- and 4-year-olds benefiting from some funded early education was 1,283,500 or 96% of the 3- and 4-year-old old population (1,264,420 or 95% in 2012) - an increase of 19,080 children. The percentage benefiting has increased by 1% from last year. For 4-year-olds, the figure has increased slightly from last year and is at its highest over the last 5 years (now 98%). The proportion for 3-year-olds, whilst up from last year and at its 5-year high at 94%, still remains slightly lower than that for 4-year-olds. In January 2013, the part-time equivalent number of funded early education places taken up by 3- and 4-year-olds was 1,253,000 or 94% of 3- and 4-year-old children (1,229,500 or 93% in 2012). For 4-year-olds, the proportion of part-time equivalent places taken up has risen by 1% from 2012 to 97%. The figure for 3-year-olds has also increased by 1% up to 97% of the 3-year-old population. For the first time this publication includes details of providers who employ staff with qualified teacher status ( QTS ) or early years professional status ( EYPS ) and numbers benefiting by Ofsted inspection rating. In January 2013, of the 3- and 4-year-old children benefiting from some funded early education at private, voluntary and independent ( PVI ) providers, 49% did so at settings with staff with QTS or EYPS . Excluding those providers not yet inspected or where there was no match to Ofsted, 80% of 3- and 4-year-olds benefited from some funded early education at a setting with an Ofsted rating of good or outstanding.

/government/publications/more-affordable-childcare,"Childcare is a major concern for many families. For families across Britain, finding the right care for their children presents huge difficulties; whether that be availability, price or suitability. Parents often find it too difficult to arrange the right sort of care at the right price. The government published ‘More great childcare’ in January, which set out plans to improve the quality of childcare. More affordable childcare builds on this, setting out the government’s plans to: help families to meet the costs of childcare increase the amount of affordable provision give parents the right information so they can make informed choices about childcare Related to this Evidence to inform the Childcare Commission Childcare Commission: call for evidence - consultation results Childcare regulation consultation Consultation on proposed changes to the role of the local authority in early education and childcare - consultation results Early education and childcare statutory guidance for local authorities"

/government/news/new-accountability-arrangements-for-infant-schools-from-2016,"On 27 March 2014, we published our response to the consultation on reforming the way we hold primary schools to account. We announced the introduction of the reception baseline assessment from 2016 as a new way of measuring primary schools’ progress. The baseline assessment will also allow us to monitor the progress of pupils in infant schools. From 2016, we will be able to measure and publish pupils’ attainment from reception year to the end of key stage 1 ( KS1 ) for the first time. However, there will not be a floor standard for infant or first schools. Infant school pupils taking the reception baseline in 2016 will reach the end of KS1 in 2019, so we will first publish the progress of pupils in infant schools in the 2019 performance tables . To help increase confidence and consistency in our moderation of infant schools, we will be increasing the proportion of schools where KS1 assessments are moderated externally. From summer 2015, half of all infant schools will have their KS1 assessments externally moderated. We will continue to support low attaining pupils through the low prior attainment funding. Once the early years foundation stage (EYFS) profile stops being compulsory in 2016, we will use the outcomes from the baseline assessment to allocate low priority funding to primary schools, including infant schools."
/guidance/2016-early-years-foundation-stage-assessment-and-reporting-arrangements-ara/section-4-reporting-and-using-results,"## 4.1 Reporting to parentsParents should be involved in the assessment process on a regular, ongoing basis. They should be encouraged to take part in their child’s learning and development.All EYFS providers must give parents a written summary of a pupil’s attainment against the early learning goals (ELGs). For each ELG this must state whether the pupil is:*	meeting expected levels of development*	exceeding expected levels or *	not yet reaching expected levels (‘emerging’)At the end of reception year, providers should give parents a written report which:*	states the pupil’s attainment against the ELGs *	summarises attainment in all areas of learning*	comments on general progress including the characteristics of effective learning*	explains arrangements for discussing the profileReports should: *	be specific to the pupil *	be concise and informative*	help to identify appropriate next stepsPractitioners may use the information provided by EYFS profile assessment as a basis for their reports to parents. Settings must offer parents a reasonable opportunity to discuss the outcomes of the EYFS profile with their child’s teacher. This meeting should be within the term in which the EYFS profile has been completed. Teachers may wish to consider making the pupil’s profile available to parents as part of this discussion. If parents ask to see a copy of their child’s profile, the setting must make this available. ###4.2 Pupils who transfer to a new schoolThe Education (Pupil Information)(England)Regulations 2005 (S.I. 2005/1437) require schools to transfer a pupil’s educational record and common transfer file (CTF) to any new school to which a pupil transfers in England, Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland. The means of transfer to a school outside England must be in line with the arrangements for transfer between schools in England. If a pupil transfers schools before the summer half term holiday, the new setting must report the pupil results to its local authority (LA). If a pupil transfers schools during the second half of the summer term then the previous school is responsible for reporting to the LA.Copies of every report forming part of a pupil’s educational record must also be transferred automatically when a pupil changes school. Certain information, including teacher assessment, is transferred securely via the CTF. Read the [CTF guidance]( https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/common-transfer-file) for details of the statutory information that should form part of the file. Management information system suppliers will usually provide further guidance to schools, specific to their system.####Governing body responsibilitiesThe governing body must arrange to have the following information sent to the pupil’s new school: *	the pupil’s educational record*	the defined items of data that comprise the [CTF]( https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/common-transfer-file) This task is often delegated to headteachers by governing bodies. The information must be sent within 15 school days of the pupil ceasing to be registered at the old school, unless the new school is not known. In this case it should be sent within 15 school days of any request from the pupil’s new school. If the new school is unknown, the Department for Education (DfE) recommends that the school should still complete the CTF and load it onto the school to school (s2s) secure transfer system. If schools don’t receive a CTF for a new pupil they can ask their LA to search for the file on s2s.Where both the old and the new school have the necessary facilities, the CTF must be sent to the new school either: *	through [s2s]( https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-to-school-guides-for-schools-and-local-authorities) *	over a secure network that can only be accessed by the LA, the governing body or a teacher at any school within that LA The basic requirement is that the old school will send the educational records and CTF to the new school by 1 of these methods. If either school doesn’t have the facilities to send or receive information in this format, then the LA may provide the file where there are agreed and secure local arrangements to that effect.### 4.3 How EYFS profile assessment results are usedYear 1 teachers use EYFS profile assessment data to understand each pupil’s development and learning needs. Providers should ensure that year 1 teachers receive all the required information detailed in this guidance. EYFS profile assessment data can be a source of information about levels of development within a school or setting. For example:*	levels of learning and development in each of the areas of learning for individual pupils, classes and year groups *	the attainment of pupils born in different months of the year*	the attainment of different groups of pupils, for example boys and girls Schools may also wish to conduct further analysis using wider contextual information. The DfE will publish [national and LA data](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics) so that they can compare their pupils’ attainment on a regional and national basis. There are no achievement and attainment tables for the EYFS. The government has committed to publishing policy input and impact indicators. These are set out in departmental business plans. One of the DfE’s impact indicators is the proportion of pupils achieving a ‘good level of development’ in the EYFS by free school meal eligibility. The DfE will use statistical measures to show progress against this indicator.*[CTF]: common transfer file*[ELGs]: early learning goals*[EYFS]: early years foundation stage *[DfE]: Department for Education*[SCE]: Service Children’s Education*[LA]: local authority*[LAs]: local authorities"
/government/news/free-childcare-to-be-available-for-toddlers-who-turn-two-this-month,"Parents of toddlers turning two this April are being encouraged by the Deputy Prime Minister to check if they can get free childcare. From this September, 15 hours of free childcare a week are being made available to around 130,000 two-year-olds from lower income backgrounds across England. The first of these eligible toddlers will have their second birthdays this month. Nick Clegg, Deputy Prime Minister, said: High quality childcare can make a huge difference to children at the start of their lives. By getting things right from the off, they are much more likely to be ready when they start school. “If your son or daughter is turning two this April or later, they may be eligible for 15 hours free childcare a week. So make sure you check with your local nursery or local authority to find out if you’re entitled.” Parents can find out if their child is eligible by contacting either their local nursery provider or their local authority. These places will initially be targeted on children from families receiving an out-of-work benefit and those who are looked after by their local authority. Children from disadvantaged backgrounds are known to be more at risk of poor development, with evidence showing that differences emerge early on in life. High quality early education can make a difference to a child’s progress and the additional government money will help to make sure children from poorer families do not lose out. Local authorities are being encouraged to raise awareness of the offer of free childcare for two year olds so that as many families as possible take up the offer. The government has also announced capital funding allocations to councils totalling £100 million, to help build, extend or improve nurseries and early education facilities. The free childcare entitlement for two-year-olds was rolled out early in 10 pilot areas last September. Currently, more than 850,000 three and four year olds nationally access up to 15 hours of free early education every week. Notes to editors A breakdown of the number of children that it is estimated will be eligible for free places in each local authority, together with information on funding being provided in 2013-14, is available from the Department for Education. Children from families receiving one of the following meet the criteria for free childcare from September: Income Support Income-based Job Seekers’ Allowance Income-related Employment and Support Allowance Support under Part VI of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 the Guaranteed element of State Pension Credit if you have an annual income of less than £16,190 and get Child Tax Credit, provided you are not also entitled to Working Tax Credit. The 10 pilot areas which trialled the free two-year-old entitlement are: Blackpool, Cornwall, Greenwich, Kent, Lambeth, Lancashire, Newcastle, Northamptonshire, Peterborough and Rotherham."

The distinction between the hall, kitchen and classroom suites allows the structure of each to be considered separately, maximising cost efficiency. Key features of the design are that: all classrooms have direct access to the outdoors toilets for the youngest pupils are directly off the classrooms for better staff supervision (one toilet is positioned close to one of the main exits allowing it to be reached during breaktimes without going into the main school) separate access points around the building ensure there is no congestion at the start and end of the day (nursery and reception pupils can enter directly via their coat storage area) all classrooms are orthogonal, 7.2 metres deep and lit from both sides by daylight roof lights bring daylight into circulation areas air is drawn across the classrooms and out through high-level windows ensuring good ventilation services and security are zoned to allow for different uses of the school the classroom and administration suites could form a separate block on a school site where the hall is being retained the main reception provides a controlled entry point for visitors with easy access to the hall for after-school community events"
/government/news/dfe-to-close-arms-length-bodies-to-improve-accountability,"The Cabinet Office has today published its cross-government review of public bodies. This impacts on all government departments and Education Secretary Michael Gove has confirmed which of the Department for Education’s (DfE) arm’s length public bodies will close as part of plans to improve accountability, transparency and efficiency. The decisions are set out below. The following bodies will be closed: Teenage Pregnancy Independent Advisory Group (TPIAG) Teachers TV Board of Governors The following bodies have already been told they are to close (with some essential functions to be taken on by the DfE): British Educational Communications and Technology Agency (Becta) General Teaching Council for England (GTCE) Qualifications and Curriculum Development Agency (QCDA) The following bodies are still under review: Children and Family Court Advisory Support Service (CAFCASS) Partnerships for Schools (PfS) Office of the Children’s Commissioner (OCC) Training and Development Agency for Schools (TDA) National College for Leadership of Schools and Children’s Services (NC) School Support Staff Negotiating Body (SSSNB) Children’s Workforce Development Council (CWDC) Young People’s Learning Agency (YPLA) The following will be retained: Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulation (Ofqual) Office for Standards in Education (Ofsted) School Teachers’ Review Body (STRB) School Food Trust (SFT) (remaining as a charity with the potential to become a community interest company). Secretary of State for Education Michael Gove said: There has been a proliferation of arm’s length public bodies in recent years, with 17 across the education and children’s sectors alone. These organisations are expensive and by removing responsibility from ministers and handing it to unelected officials they reduce accountability. These organisations have done much valuable work, but I believe there are too many of them. If we are to see a genuine improvement in standards in our schools, it won’t be delivered by people at the centre; it will have to be driven by school leaders and teachers at the frontline. And where there are functions that need to be done at the national level, they should be properly accountable through ministers - unless there are compelling reasons why they cannot be. The Government acknowledges the fact public servants have worked hard in these bodies and is committed to working with chairs and chief executives to ensure any change is conducted as fairly and smoothly as possible. Notes to editors The current roles of the mentioned bodies are: BECTA - established in 1998 through the reconstitution of the National Council for Educational Technology (NCET). It led the Government’s Harnessing Technology strategy. CAFCASS - set up in 2001, its role is to safeguard and promote the welfare of the child. It gives advice to the courts and makes provision for children to be represented. CWDC - set up in 2005 to support implementation of the Every Child Matters agenda. Its remit is to improve workforce skills and competences through investment in training and development, and embed integrated working practices across the children and young people’s workforce. GTCE - set up in 2000 as an independent self-regulatory professional body for teachers. TPIAG - set up in 2000 as the result of a recommendation in the Social Exclusion Unit’s 1999 report on teenage pregnancy that an independent, expert group should monitor the previous Government’s ten-year Teenage Pregnancy Strategy. NC - set up in 2000 to transform leadership practice in schools. Since then it has expanded to include the training and development of school business leaders and more recently, directors of children’s services. OCC - role was established under the Children Act 2004 to promote the views and interests of children in England. It is a statutory organisation designed to promote children’s interests by exploring and challenging issues from their perspective. Ofqual - established as a non-ministerial department by the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learners Act 2009 on 1 April 2010. It is the independent regulator of qualifications and assessment in England, reporting to Parliament. Ofsted - established following the 1992 Education (Schools) Act, Ofsted is a non-ministerial government department responsible for the inspection and regulation of schools and colleges; childcare and aspects of children’s social care, including local authority children’s services, adoption and fostering services; and the Children and Family Courts Advisory Support Service (CAFCASS). PfS - set up in 2004 as a joint venture between the Department and private sector to achieve value for money in the delivery of school building projects. QCDA - established on 1 April 2010 by the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learners Act 2009, which split the former Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) into two: the QCDA and Ofqual. SFT - set up in 2005 as the Government’s delivery partner in transforming the quality and uptake of school food. Supports schools and local authorities to comply with regulations on school food standards, and produces guidance, good practice and targeted support. SSSNB - established in July 2009 and became a statutory advisory body in January 2010. Its remit is to consider and seek agreement on matters relating to the remuneration and conditions of employment relating to the duties or working time of school support staff in maintained schools in England. STRB - established in 1991 as an independent body to examine and report on matters relating to the statutory conditions of employment of school teachers in England and Wales. Teachers TV Board of Governors - established in January 2005. Advised DfE on the best practices of a UK public broadcasting service and helped ensure the Teachers TV supplier was held accountable for the public funds it receives. TDA - created by the Education Act 2005. Is primarily concerned with securing the supply of the workforce, assuring the quality of initial teacher training and supporting workforce reform. YPLA - set up by DfE in April 2010 under the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learners Act 2009. Funds young people’s participation in education and training. The TTV Board of Governors is no longer required as TTV has moved solely online. It was established to ensure editorial independence, as required by the Ofcom TV broadcast license and the Communications Act 2003. The remit for the Teenage Pregnancy Independent Advisory Group (TPIAG) comes to an end in December 2010 and will not be renewed or replaced. The Department will be making arrangements for ministers to access expert advice when needed, to help make further progress in reducing teenage pregnancy rates. British Educational Communications and Technology Agency (Becta): Schools professionals are best placed to make many decisions about their school’s ICT requirement. Where functions need to be retained centrally - for example to ensure good value for money for schools in procuring technology or to protect support for those with special needs - this is currently being arranged by the Department. Abolition of the General Teaching Council for England (GTCE’s) is part of the Government’s wider plans to streamline and improve arrangements for tackling underperforming teachers. The Qualifications and Curriculum Development Agency (QCDA) will be abolished but the Government is committed to ensuring some activities, such as National Curriculum tests, continue to be delivered. The following reviews are underway: The Department’s workforce bodies (TDA, NC and CWDC) are under Departmental review. We are considering how their key functions will best be exercised in the future. YPLA is also under Departmental review as part of the wider work on education structural reforms. PfS is being reviewed as part of the Department’s review of all capital investment in schools, Early Years, colleges and sixth forms, which is being led by Sebastian James, Group Operations Director of DSG International plc. The review team includes Kevin Grace, Tesco - Director of Property Services; Barry Quirk, Chief Executive of Lewisham Council; John Hood, former Vice-Chancellor of University of Oxford; and Sir John Egan, former Chief Executive of Jaguar and BAA. The review was launched 12 July. The call for evidence was issued 6 August and closed on 17 September. A forward plan for capital investment during the next spending review period will be produced by the end of the calendar year. OCC: On 12 July the Secretary of State announced that an independent review of the role and office of the OCC is to be carried out by John Dunford, recently retired General Secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders. He will consider the powers, remit and function of the commissioner in his review as well as the impact the post has made to date. John Dunford will have made his recommendations to the Secretary of State by the end of November 2010. CAFCASS is being reviewed as part of the Family Justice Review (FJR), which is considering the whole of the family justice system. The FJR began work in March 2010 and formally launched its call for evidence in June 2010. The review panel is independently chaired by David Norgrove, Chair of the Pensions Regulator and the Low Pay Commission, and includes a senior family judge, a director of children’s services, a lead member for children’s services, a senior colleague from the voluntary sector, the Welsh Children’s Commissioner, and a director from both this Department and the Ministry of Justice. The review panel will then provide an interim report in March 2011, which will include a steer on the future of CAFCASS and be the subject of public consultation. The review panel will publish its final report in September 2011. SSSNB: The Secretary of State is yet to make a final decision on the future of the SSSNB. A further announcement will be made in due course following discussions between the Secretary of State and the SSSNB’s Independent Chair, and support staff employer and trade union member representatives. School Food Trust (SFT): The Government is committed to ensuring pupils can eat healthy, nutritious school food. The School Food Trust has developed significant expertise around the school food agenda throughout the past five years and continues to have an important role in supporting schools and local authorities to meet the nutritional standards. As a community interest company (CIC), the trust will continue to be able to play that role and to provide advice to the Government, which is informed by the practical work it does out in the field. It will also have the freedom to sell its services - advice, guidance, research - to local authorities, schools, caterers and others, on a commercial basis. CICS are limited companies with special additional features, created for use by people who want to conduct a business or other activity for community benefit and not purely for private advantage. This is achieved by a “community interest test” and “asset lock”, which ensures the CIC is established for community purposes and the assets and profits dedicated to these purposes. Registration of a company as a CIC has to be approved by the regulator, who also has a continuing monitoring and enforcement role. We expect SFT will continue to take forward a number of activities for the Department. The level of future DfE support for the trust depends on the spending review outcome and the tasks SFT is asked to undertake for the DfE. Some essential functions of the arm’s length bodies that are to be closed will be transferred to DfE. Further details of this will be available in due course. [Contact:997]"

/government/news/sam-gyimah-visits-paris-to-share-best-practice-in-childcare,"Education and Childcare Minister Sam Gyimah visited Paris last week, where he exchanged ideas with his French counterpart around their shared priorities of expanding high-quality childcare, and ensuring all children get the best possible start in life. The importance of early years cannot be understated - a child’s life chances are already being decided before they have even fastened their shoes on their first day of school. That’s why this government is committed to making sure every family has access to high-quality childcare so that more parents can return to work if they choose to, without being restricted by the cost of childcare. And we have pledged to offer 30 hours of free childcare for working parents of 3- and 4-year-olds as well introducing Tax-Free Childcare from 2017 , which will give up to 1.8 million families the opportunity to receive up to £2,000 of support per year, per child. Education and Childcare Minister Sam Gyimah said: We are committed to making sure that every family regardless of their background has access to high-quality, affordable childcare. And in France, high-quality childcare is central to efforts to support families to balance their work and home life. That’s why I’m keen to find out what works for them, and share best practice with our European neighbours. The minister spent 22 to 23 September in Paris, finding out how French childcare providers not only provide early education for children, but support parents in getting back to work. He met with practitioners and visited a number of providers, including Crèche la Maison de Gavroche, to see how childcare can be scaled up in disadvantaged communities, and the Crèche l’Arc-en-Ciel, where he learned how unemployed and single parents can be helped back to work, with support such as wrap-around care and CV writing workshops. He also met with the Deputy Head of Mission, where he discussed strengths and weaknesses of the French system with key leaders in the early years, and had lunch with the National Family Benefits Fund Agency, to explore funding reforms and the delivery of additional childcare places focused on disadvantaged communities. The minister also paid a visit to the OECD headquarters, where he met with Andreas Schleicher, Montserrat Gomendio and Yuri Belfali, and found out about improving the international evidence base on early childhood education and care. And at the Ministry of Education, Sam Gyimah took part in in-depth policy discussions on the latest reforms of early education, training of early years teachers, and how resources can be allocated to tackling disadvantaged children. The visit comes after the French Minister for Childhood, Family, Ageing and Autonomy, Laurence Rossignol, visited London in February. While in the UK she met with Sam Gyimah to discuss childcare provision and support for parents. Among the innovative ways of delivering early years education in France are: ‘bridging classes’, which help children get ready for school crèches that coach parents back to work childcare centres based in nursing homes pre-schools supporting the parents of children who are at risk of being taken into care Notes to editors This government spends £5 billion on childcare - more than any previous government and an increase of £1 billion since 2010. Through the introduction of the Childcare Bill we will enshrine in law this government’s absolute commitment to supporting working families. More parents than ever before are taking up the free childcare offer, with 99% of 4-year-olds and 94% of 3-year-olds now accessing 15 hours a week of free childcare. The new 30-hour offer doubles the amount of free childcare available to hard working parents with 3- and 4-year-olds to 1,140 hours per year. This is worth £5,000 per child per year. [Contact:997]"

/government/speeches/michael-gove-to-westminster-academy,"There is no profession more noble, no calling more vital, no role more important than teaching. Far and away the best part of my job is spending time with teachers – watching and admiring, listening and learning, being uplifted and inspired. Whether it was the brilliant young head of History at Lampton School, Hounslow, the English lesson I observed at ULT’s fantastic Manchester Academy, the superb science teaching I was privileged to glimpse at Urmston Grammar in Trafford or the wonderful primary lesson I so much enjoyed when I visited Durand Primary in Brixton, each of these encounters with great teaching left me feeling more optimistic about the future. I believe we have the best generation of teachers ever in our schools, and one of the most dynamic factors behind that has been the phenomenal impact of Teach First. The single most enjoyable evening I’ve had in politics was spent at the Teach First annual awards, celebrating the brilliant and inspirational work of young people like Manjit More and Ed Watson, teachers whose passion for their subject and sheer enjoyment in learning are life enhancing, indeed for those they teach, life changing. And one of the reasons I’m here at Westminster Academy today is that Teach First teachers are playing their part, alongside so many other gifted professionals, in changing the lives of young people immeasurably for the better. This school, like many other great schools is generating impressive results for children from a challengingly diverse range of backgrounds. But one of the tragedies of the last thirteen years is that, despite record spending, there still aren’t enough of these good schools. While we have some of the best schools in the world, we also have too many which are still struggling. There are hundreds of primaries where the majority of children fail to get to an acceptable level in maths and English. The majority of children leave those schools without the knowledge and skills required properly to follow the secondary school curriculum and make a success of the rest of their time in education. For many of those children who have not reached an acceptable level of literacy by the end of primary, their time at secondary is marked by defiance and disruption. We have hundreds of thousands of persistent truants and thousands of pupils are excluded for disruption and assault. Overall – as a country – about four in ten do not meet basic standards by the age of eleven and only about half manage at least a ‘C’ in both English and maths GCSE. What makes this situation so much worse, indeed indefensible, is that poor performance is so powerfully concentrated in areas of disadvantage. In our education system it is still far too often the case that deprivation is destiny. The gap in attainment between rich and poor, which widened in recent years, is a scandal. For disadvantaged pupils, a gap opens even before primary school. Leon Feinstein’s research has shown that the highest early achievers from deprived backgrounds are overtaken by lower achieving children from advantaged backgrounds by age five. Schools should be engines of social mobility – the places where accidents of birth and the unfairness of life’s lottery are overcome through the democratisation of access to knowledge. But in the schools system we inherited the gap between rich and poor just widens over time. The poorest children in our school system are those eligible for free school meals. There are about 80,000 children in every school year who are eligible. Tracking their progress through school we can see they fall further and further behind their peers by the time they reach the end of primary. At secondary the gulf grows wider still. By sixteen, a pupil not entitled to free school meals is over 3 times more likely to achieve five good GCSEs as one who is entitled. By the time they reach university age just 45 children out of a cohort of 80,000 on free school meals make it to Oxbridge. On a moral level, this waste of talent, this blighting of individual lives, is an affront to decency. And in economic terms, as we face an increasingly competitive global environment, it’s a tragedy. Other nations have been much more successful recently in getting more and more people to be educated to a higher level. With capital so footloose, labour needs to be better educated and trained than ever before. But while we have been moving backwards with education reform over the last few years, as Tony Blair has pointed out, other nations have been forging ahead much faster and further when it comes to reforming and improving their education systems. The international comparisons are stark. Under the last Government in the most recent PISA survey – the international league tables of school performance – we fell from 4th to 14th in science, 7th to 17th in literacy, 8th to 24th in maths. And at the same time studies such as those undertaken by Unicef and the OECD underline that we have one of the most unequal educational systems in the world, coming near bottom out of 57 for educational equity with one of the biggest gulfs between independent and state schools of any developed nation. Governments often choose to compare the present with the past and say: haven’t we come far. But the entire human race is progressing at an accelerating pace – technologically, economically and educationally. Especially educationally. And we are falling behind. As a nation instead of comparing ourselves with the past, we should compare ourselves with the best. And those who want to stay the best, or be the best, are changing fast. There are three essential characteristics which mark out the best performing and fastest reforming education systems. Rigorous research, from the OECD and others, has shown that more autonomy for individual schools helps drive higher standards. Landmark work by Professor Michael Barber for McKinsey, backed up by the research of Fenton Whelan, has shown that teacher quality is critical: the highest performing education nations have the best qualified teachers. And research again from the OECD underlines that rigorous external assessment – proper testing you can trust – helps lever up standards. And these lessons are being applied with vigour and rigour in other nations. In America, President Obama is pressing ahead with radical school reform to close the gap between rich and poor. And he’s implementing all three policies to generate lasting improvement. He is promoting greater autonomy by providing cash and other incentives to encourage more charter schools, the equivalent of our free schools and academies. He has offered extra support to programmes designed to attract more great people into teaching and leadership. And he has encouraged states and school districts to provide greater accountability through improved testing and assessment. In other ambitious countries, the drive for greater autonomy is generating great performance. In Canada, and specifically in Alberta, schools have also been liberated, given the autonomy enjoyed by charter schools in the US. Headteachers control their own budgets, set their own ethos and shape their own environments. In Calgary and Edmonton, a diverse range of autonomous schools offer professionals freedom and parents choice. And the result? Alberta now has the best performing state schools of any English-speaking region. In Sweden, the old bureaucratic monopoly that saw all state schools run by local government was ended and the system opened up to allow new, non-selective, state schools to be set up by a range of providers. It has allowed greater diversity, increased parental choice and has seen results improve – with results improving fastest of all in the areas where schools exercised the greatest degree of autonomy and parents enjoyed the widest choice. In Singapore, often cited as an exemplar of centralism, dramatic leaps in attainment have been secured by schools where principals are exercising a progressively greater degree of operational autonomy. The Government has deliberately encouraged greater diversity in the schools system and as the scope for innovation has grown, so Singapore’s competitive advantage over other nations has grown too. The good news in England is that a new Government committed to following this path to success already has great examples here to draw on. Granting greater autonomy has already generated some great success stories here. In the five or so years after 1988 the last Conservative Government created fifteen city technology colleges. They are all-ability comprehensives, overwhelmingly located in poorer areas, but they enjoy much greater independence than other schools. They have been a huge success. Now the proportion of pupils eligible for free school meals in CTCs who achieve five or more good GCSEs A* to C is more than twice as high as for all maintained mainstream schools. These results are now being replicated by the small group of schools that were turned into academies under the last government – and which were modelled on the CTCs. As a group they improved three times faster than other schools this year and some individual academies posted incredible improvements of 15 to 25%. Those in some particularly challenging areas, such as Burlington Danes on London’s White City estate, run by the charity ARK and the Harris Academies in South London secured dramatic gains. It’s absolutely clear that academies and CTCs succeed because of their autonomy. Heads are given the freedom to shape their own curriculum; they are at liberty to insist on tougher discipline, pay staff more, extend school hours, and develop a personal approach to every pupil. In his memoirs published last week Tony Blair gave an excellent description of why they’re so effective: [An academy] belongs not to some remote bureaucracy, not to the rulers of government, local or national, but to itself, for itself. The school is in charge of its own destiny. This gives it pride and purpose. And most of all, freed from the extraordinarily debilitating and often, in the worst sense, political correct interference from state or municipality, academies have just one thing in mind, something shaped not by political prejudice but by common sense: what will make the school excellent. These freedoms were curtailed. But this Government trusts teachers to control the classroom and trusts parents to choose schools. That’s why we’re offering all schools the chance to take on academy status – starting with those rated outstanding by Ofsted. Already over 140, and counting, of the best state schools have taken up our offer of academy freedoms – in just three months. All of these schools have committed to using their new found powers and freedom to support weaker schools. It’s also why we’ll continue to challenge schools that are struggling; either they improve fast or they will have their management replaced by an academy sponsor, or an outstanding school, with a proven track record. There was an artificial ceiling of 400 such academies placed and the programme was not refused to primaries. But I am removing both of these barriers to the rapid expansion of the programme. And we’re helping great teachers, charities, parent groups and some existing academy sponsors, to start new Free Schools. This morning we’ve announced the very first batch of 16 projects that are ready to progress to the next stage of development and are keen to be up and running in a year’s time. Given that it typically takes three to five years to set up a new school I’m incredibly impressed that just ten weeks after launching the policy there are already projects at this advanced a stage. It’s a tribute to the incredible energy and commitment of these pioneering sixteen groups and the immense hard work and commitment of a superb team of civil servants who’ve been helping them. Following their lead are hundreds of other groups, each with innovative and exiting proposals, in active contact with the Department and the New Schools Network. I’m particularly excited that amongst this first batch are projects proposed by outstanding young teachers like Sajid Hussein – who’s King’s Science Academy will be located in one of the poorer areas of Bradford and Mark Lehain - another state school teacher who sees the potential for Free Schools to help students who’ve been let down by the current system. One of the reasons I’m so attracted to the Free Schools policy is the experience of the KIPP schools – which started with two Teach for America graduates in Houston with an incredible vision for transforming the life chances of some of their city’s poorest young people. Now parents queue round the block for a chance to get their child into a KIPP school and there are almost hundred across the US – their results are astonishing and almost all their pupils get to a top university. Only by allowing new providers to set up schools will this kind of innovation breath life into our education system. And only by allowing new providers into the system will we meet the growing demand for new primary school places in those parts of the country where the population is increasing. Under the old bureaucratic system of controlling education it could take five years or more to get a new school up and running. But we have real and pressing demographic pressures which demand the creation of more good school places in the next few years. I don’t believe that enough was done to prepare schools, especially primaries, for this pressure. The way that capital was allocated was much too bureaucratic and slow moving, primaries weren’t prioritised properly and local authorities were given the wrong sums of money. We’re taking steps now to put that right – and one of those crucial steps is helping new schools to become established in areas where there’s a growing demand for school places. While this drive towards a more autonomous school system is an essential part of our plans it is only part of a wider series of reforms necessary to make us truly competitive internationally and to close the gap between rich and poor. Our first Education White Paper, to be launched later this year, will lay out a programme of reform for this parliament that will not only lead to a more autonomous school system led by professionals but will also increase the number of great teachers and leaders in our schools give teachers the power to tackle poor discipline create a fairer funding system so that extra funds follow the poorest pupils who need the most support *introduce a simpler, more focused National Curriculum restore faith in our battered qualifications system. Teachers and other education professionals will be at the front and centre of the White Paper because everything else we want to achieve flows naturally from the quality of the workforce. And that is the second great principle of education reform - nothing matters more than having great teachers - and great headteachers. In the 1990s a series of in-depth studies conducted by American academics revealed a remarkably consistent pattern. The quality of an individual teacher is the single most important determinant in a child’s educational progress. Those students taught by the best teacher make three times as much progress as those taught by the least effective. And the effect of good teaching isn’t ephemeral but cumulative, with students exposed to consistently effective teaching making faster and faster progress than their contemporaries, while the effect of bad teaching isn’t just relative failure but regression in absolute terms. Research in the Boston school district of the US found that pupils placed with the weakest maths teachers actually fell back in absolute performance during the year - their test scores got worse. Indeed, wherever we look across the globe, a crucial factor which defines those countries whose schools are most successful is the quality of those in the teaching profession. In Finland teachers are drawn from the top ten per cent of graduates. In the two other nations which rival Finland globally for consistent educational excellence – Singapore and South Korea – a similar philosophy applies. Only those graduates in the top quarter or third of any year can go into teaching. In South Korea the academic bar is actually set higher for primary school teachers than those in secondaries, because the South Koreans, quite rightly, consider those early years to be crucial. Of course academic success at university doesn’t automatically make you a good teacher. You need emotional intelligence as well as the more traditional kind. The best teachers demonstrate that indefinable quality of leadership which springs from enjoying being with young people and wanting to bring out the best in them. And the reason why Teach First has been so incredibly successful in this country is that they have not only recruited some of our most gifted graduates from our top universities, they have rigorously sifted them to identify those with the leadership and personal qualities that make the best teachers. Thanks to Teach First, more and more of our most talented young graduates have gone on to teach in some of our toughest schools. In 2002, only four graduates from Oxford University chose a career teaching in a challenging school; in 2009/10, 8% of finalists applied to teach in a challenging school through Teach First, and the programme is now 7th in the Times’ 100 top graduate recruiters. The impact on schools has been incredible. An evaluation by the University of Manchester found that challenging schools which take Teach First teachers have seen a statistically significant improvement in their GCSE results and that the more Teach First teachers were placed in a challenging school, the bigger the improvement. With programmes setting up in dozens of countries from Lebanon to Australia it is now a global success story. And many Teach First alumni are now getting involved with Free School and Academy projects – applying the entrepreneurial spirit that won them places on the programme to the new powers and freedoms that we’re offering to professionals. All of this explains why one of the first decisions I took in office was to increase Teach First’s grant by £4 million to enable them to double their number of recruits each year; expand across the whole country and for the first time into primary schools. In the White Paper we will unveil a whole range of proposals alongside the growth in Teach First to ensure we attract the best possible people into education to help in our mission. And alongside that we will, perhaps even more critically, ensure that we help those teaching now to do their jobs even better by providing them with the support, additional professional development and security they need to fulfil their full potential and help their pupils do the same. We’ll be announcing new policies which will make it easier and more rewarding for teachers to acquire new skills and additional qualifications. We will make it easier for teachers to deepen and enhance their subject knowledge, ensuring teachers are seen, alongside university academics, as the guardians of the intellectual life of the nation. We need to act because not enough good people are coming to teaching, or staying in teaching. Teachers who have left the profession tell me that the grinding load of bureaucracy which has been piled on them has been a major factor in walking away from a job so many entered with such high hopes and idealism. One of the best headteachers I’ve ever met told me during the election that he yearned to be free from a Government which had baseball-batted him over the head with bureaucracy. So we will be tackling bureaucracy at source, stripping out unnecessary obligations placed on hard-pressed teachers and overworked governors, simplifying the Ofsted inspection regime and tackling health and safety rules which inhibit out-of-classroom learning and have undermined competitive team sports. But, crucial as reducing bureaucracy will be, nothing is a bigger barrier to getting more talented people to become teachers, and stay teachers, than discipline and behaviour. Among undergraduates tempted to go into teaching the reason most commonly cited for pursuing another profession, well ahead of concerns about salary, is the fear of not being safe in our schools. There are massive problems with violence and disruption in our most challenging schools. There are over 300,000 suspensions per year and about a quarter of a million persistent truants. Thousands of teachers every year are physically attacked and about one in three teachers have been subject to false accusations. We will never get more talented people into the classroom; we will never give disadvantaged children the inspiration they need to succeed, unless we solve this problem. In our first months we’ve already taken action to give teachers more power to deal with discipline problems. First, we’ve removed the ban on same-day detentions, giving heads and teachers a stronger deterrent against poor behaviour. Previously, teachers had the power to put pupils in detention, but only if the school gave their parents 24 hours’ notice in writing. In future each school will be able to decide what notice to give and how to inform parents. We’ve also increased teachers’ powers to search troublemakers. Previously teachers could only search, without consent, anyone who was suspected of carrying a knife or other weapon. We’ve significantly extended this list to include: Alcohol, controlled drugs, stolen property, personal electronic devices such as mobile phones, MP3 players and cameras, legal highs, pornography, cigarettes and fireworks. In the White Paper we will outline further changes including the clarification and simplification of use of force guidance and crucially how we’ll protect teachers against false and malicious allegations from pupils and parents. This growing problem acts as a huge deterrent to teachers – especially male teachers in primary schools. Newly released figures show that 28% of primary schools now have no male teachers at all – which can make it even hard to provide a supportive and safe environment for disruptive boys. So the message is clear. We’re on the side of teachers, we’re determined to restore order and we’re not going to be deflected from laying down lines which the badly behaved must not cross. But just as we need to be clear about the need for order we also need to be clear about the pressing, urgent, need to improve provision for those disruptive, difficult and damaged children who need special help. In the White Paper we’ll lay out plans to radically improve the environment in which disruptive and excluded pupils are educated and we will ensure that those organisations with a proven track record in turning young lives round are given the opportunity to do more. And, of course, we need to tackle the deep-rooted causes of educational disaffection that leads so many young people to be disruptive in the first place. At the heart of our White Paper plans for a simpler, fairer funding system is the Pupil Premium. This will see extra money attached to young people from deprived backgrounds - which will be clearly identified to their parents. Schools that benefit from this additional cash will not be told exactly how to use it – but we will expect them to ensure that children struggling with the basics get the extra support they need so they don’t fall irretrievably behind their peers. And to help ensure money is spent wisely right at the beginning of schooling we will take radical action to get reading right. Children cannot read to learn before they have learned to read. Without that secure foundation even the most gifted and innovative teacher will struggle to inspire and inform. We know that, whatever else may work, teaching children to read using the tried and tested method of systematic synthetic phonics can dramatically reduce illiteracy. So we will make sure that teacher training is improved so every new primary teacher - and every teacher in place - is secure in their grasp of phonics teaching. We will ensure teachers have the best reading materials to help embed great phonics teaching. I am clear that we need that solid foundation, but we also need to create room for greater flexibility once the basics are secure. That is why we will develop a new National Curriculum that excites and challenges young people while giving teachers the space to develop their own pedagogy. I will be saying more over the coming weeks about our plans for a curriculum review but it’s crucial that the expectations we set of what children should know will be more ambitious and based upon global evidence concerning what knowledge can be introduced to children at different ages. In particular we have to move beyond the sterile debate that sees academic knowledge as mutually exclusive to the skills required for employment; and rigour as incompatible with the enjoyment of learning. The most exciting curriculum innovations in development at the moment are those which find ways to trigger the curiosity inherent to young minds towards intellectual tough material. To take one example, the computer games developed by the brilliant mathematician Marcus du Sautoy show children’s imaginations can be harnessed to a deep understanding of the most complex ideas. Hand in hand with curriculum reform is the need to restore faith in our exam system. Qualifications are the currency of education – and just like with the money markets – confidence is everything. Over the past few years there has been a growing and justified concern, from parents and from teachers. Last month the exams regulator Ofqual acknowledged that the GCSE science exams were not set at a high enough standard. I’ve been saying this for years – backed by learned institutions like the Royal Society for Chemistry. But my warnings were ignored and the status quo retained despite the fact that it was actively damaging the education of hundreds of thousands of children a year. Critical to restoring confidence in our exams system is a much more assertive and powerful regulator. We will legislate to strengthen Ofqual and give a new regulator the powers they need to enforce rigorous standards. We will ask Ofqual to report on how our exams compare with those in other countries so we can measure the questions our 11, 16 and 18 year olds sit against those sat by their contemporaries in India, China, Singapore, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand and Canada. Our young people will increasingly be competing for jobs and university places on a global level and we can’t afford to have our young people sitting exams which aren’t competitive with the world’s best. And for A Levels we’ll give those institutions with the greatest interest in maintaining standards – universities – more power to shape exams and determine their content. As well as reforming exams to make them more rigorous we need to change league tables to make them more effective. One thing I’m determined to do is publish all the exam data held by the Government so that parents, schools and third parties can use web-based applications to create many new and bespoke sorts of tables. This will mean they’re not dependent on the measures that Government decides to use; and also that there is complete transparency about the qualifications our young people are taking. But Government still needs key measures of secondary school performance to ensure that the reforms we’re putting in place are having a real impact on performance in our schools and are closing the gap between rich and poor. Over the next few months – before the publication of the White Paper – there’s the opportunity for a real debate about what we, as a nation, should expect of young people at the age of 16. And so what these key measures should be. I think most people would agree that English and maths GCSE are an irreducible core that nearly all young people should be expected to achieve at 16. But I believe there is an argument that the vast majority of young people should take a wider range of core academic GCSEs: an English Baccalaureate that would ensure that all children – especially those from less privileged backgrounds – have a chance to gain a base of knowledge and a set of life chances too often restricted to the wealthy. So I’m proposing that the Government look at how many young people in each secondary school secure five good GCSEs including English, maths, a science, a modern or ancient language and a humanity like history or geography, art or music. Such a broad yet rigorous suite of qualifications would allow students here the chance to secure a school-leaving certificate which shares many of the virtues of the European baccalaureate approach. I am a great admirer of the already existing International Baccalaureate and am determined to support a wider take-up of that qualification. But the GCSE is a popular and resilient qualification, well understood by employers, teachers and students. It seems to me that one of the best ways of capturing the breadth and rigour of the IB while making the most of the strengths of the GCSE is to create special recognition for those students who secure good passes in a balanced range of rigorous qualifications. An English Bac could incentivise schools and students to follow the courses which best equip them, and us as a nation, to succeed. I am deeply concerned that fewer and fewer students are studying languages, it not only breeds insularity, it means an integral part of the brain’s learning capacity rusts unused. I am determined that we step up the number of students studying proper science subjects. Asian countries massively outstrip us in the growth of scientific learning and they are already reaping the cultural and economic benefits. And I am passionately concerned that we introduce more and more young people to the best that has been thought and written, which is why I lament the retreat from history teaching in some of our schools and believe also that we should incentivise deeper knowledge of our shared cultural heritage. I believe that a change in how we measure and grade schools, to reward those who have pupils who succeed in all these areas, and a special recognition of student achievement with the award of a Baccalaureate certificate to those pupils who secure these passes, could reinvigorate the culture of learning in this country. I’m not suggesting this would or should be the only measure used but I do believe that this is a valid expectation of most young people in the 21st century. It also would not preclude the study of other GCSEs outside of this core or any vocational qualifications that would be of genuine benefit for student’s progression to post-16 education and employment. But it would dramatically strengthen the position of core academic subjects in our schools and stop the shift to less challenging courses driven by the current perverse accountability system. And it would align us with the expectations other advanced countries have of their children. In nearly every other developed country in the world children are assessed in a range of core academic subjects at 15 or 16 even if they are on a “vocational” route. This is true in Europe, where for example in France all children take the Brevet des Colleges which assesses French, maths, history/geography/civics and a modern foreign language. In places like Holland that have separate vocational routes from the beginning of secondary school all children are still typically assessed on the core academic subjects (in Holland this is languages, arts, science, maths and history). In Finland – the best-performing country in Europe according to international league tables – all children are assessed in maths, Finnish, history, science and art/music at GCSE age. In Asia there is typically assessment of the whole core curriculum at GCSE level. In Singapore, for example, all pupils must take English, another language, maths, science, humanities, plus one other subject (of course they also still use O Levels in Singapore). And in the States nearly all schools have mandatory assessment during high school in maths, English, science and social studies (including history and politics). We are extremely unusual in having no requirement to study anything academic apart from English, maths and science after 14 (and only English and maths have to be assessed using GCSE). Taken altogether, the changes we want to make represent a formidable reform programme. A more autonomous school system led by professionals; a new generation of brilliant teachers; a new era of discipline in our schools; a fairer funding system; a simpler and more challenging curriculum and a qualifications system that restores standards rather than diminishing them. I’m under no illusions about how tough it will be to drive this programme through but the scale of the challenge is such that we have no choice but to be this radical and this ambitious. There is no option but to push ahead on all fronts as quickly as possible. Children only have one chance - and I am impatient to ensure that my children – that all children – get the best possible chance to succeed in our state schools."

Looking at the broad ethnicity groupings in 2012, the proportion of groups of pupils who achieved a ‘good level of development’ above the national average were those from white (65%) and mixed (64%) backgrounds. The groups that achieved below the national average were those from black (61%) Asian (60%) and Chinese (62%) backgrounds. A higher proportion (65%) of pupils whose first language is English achieved a good level of development compared with pupils whose first language was other than English (56%). 48% of pupils eligible for free school meals (FSM) achieved a good level of development compared with 67% of other pupils (those not eligible for free school meals or unclassified).

/government/news/simpler-guidance-on-regulation-means-less-bureaucracy-for-childcare-providers,"Childcare businesses will benefit from clearer and simpler guidance following a government review of how regulations governing the sector are enforced. Less confusing and bureaucratic advice on how to meet regulatory requirements will enable providers to focus more clearly on maintaining standards and safety. The Focus on Enforcement review asked childcare providers to comment on the effectiveness of regulatory enforcement and to specify how it might be improved to help them comply with the law. Action taken following the consultation addresses concerns that some smaller providers found guidance too long and hard to understand; that inspections were sometimes inconsistent and inaccurate; that some providers felt unable to challenge findings of an inspection; and that there was confusion around boundaries between different regulators and a shortage of accessible advice on how to comply. In response to the review, Ofsted has: reduced the volume of all its website guidance relating to childcare by a quarter clarified that the only mandatory reading for childcare providers is the ‘Guide to Registration on the Early Years Register’ and ‘Preparing for your Registration Visit’ - and shortened the total length of these from 93 to just 33 pages. Before the review, many providers reported that they believed that they were required to read all guidance on Ofsted ’s website, of which the review team found there to be 1,100 pages. The new guidance was uploaded on Ofsted ’s improved website in March 2014 clarified that the guidance on the Ofsted website for inspectors is for their information, rather than mandatory reading for childminders themselves strengthened its guidance to providers on preparing for their inspection, so that they are clear about how to raise concerns provided further training for inspectors on checking accuracy and making consistent judgements Nick Hudson, Ofsted Early Years Director, said: We want to help nurseries and other early years providers focus on what matters: providing a safe environment for young children in which they can learn and develop, and preparing them well so that they are ready for school. That’s why we have clarified essential guidance so that early years professionals can see what really matters. I am confident that this will help early years staff get on with doing their jobs. If they have any requests for clarification then we will be happy to help. Liz Bayam, Chief Executive of PACEY (Professional Association for Childcare & Early Years) said: PACEY members value their regulation and inspection by Ofsted . It plays a vital role in supporting parents’ confidence to leave their child in a childcare setting. As Ofsted is increasingly positioned as the sole arbiter of quality, this will be ever more so. It is good to see the steps Ofsted is now taking, as a result of the Focus on Enforcement review of the childcare sector, to make guidance more accessible, to improve advice to providers on preparing for inspection and to further train its inspectors. Now Ofsted is in more open dialogue with the sector, it can ensure remaining concerns are addressed in the coming months. Everyone working in childcare and early years wants the same thing - high quality care for children. By working with the sector Ofsted has the best chance of achieving this for our youngest children. The findings from the Focus on Enforcement review of the pubs sector have also been published today (15 May 2014), together with a response from the Home Office. Notes to editors There were 44 responses to the childcare review, which ran from February to May 2013. Focus on Enforcement reviews examine how regulation is delivered – whether through inspections, advice, and enforcement – rather than focusing on the design of the regulations themselves. For more information, including previous reviews and what they have achieved, visit the Focus on Enforcement website . On 10 March 2014 Business Minister Michael Fallon invited industry bodies to bid to help run a Business Focus on Enforcement Review - a new phase of the programme. This will allow industry groups such as trade associations to lead reviews into regulatory enforcement in their sectors and present the case for change directly to regulators and Ministers. For more information about the process and to access more information, visit Business Focus on Enforcement Government action to reduce and reform regulations themselves – including through the Red Tape Challenge and the One-in, Two-out rule, is saving businesses over £1.2 billion annually."
/government/news/views-sought-on-early-years-and-childcare-provider-regulation,"This follows the recent review of the Early Years Foundation Stage. The changes will coincide with the revised EYFS, which the government intends to publish in September. The proposals will raise expectations, with a greater focus on children’s personal, social and emotional development and the progress that children make in their learning. The proposed changes would also give those looking after children more freedom in managing their own service, while continuing to keep children safe by strengthening registration and maintaining rigorous enforcement for those who are not complying with requirements. Director Education and Care, Jean Humphrys, said: Removing unnecessary regulation and bureaucracy is important to providers. Ofsted is aiming to find the right level of enforcement to ensure that children are safe and well cared for. Our overriding ambition it to ensure that every child has the best possible start in life. The changes we are proposing provide a balance. They will reassure parents that our systems and processes for regulating early years and childcare providers are robust, preventing unsuitable people from having access to children, while simplifying inspection for those providing care. Ofsted wants the new inspection framework to help bring about even greater improvements in outcomes for children. There will be fewer judgements and grades with greater attention to the progress children make in their learning and development. Observation of activities and care practices will continue to be at the heart of inspections and providing feedback to those working with children will continue to have high priority. To allow providers more flexibility in managing their own service, Ofsted intends to stop routinely issuing restrictions or conditions on registrations, such as the number of children they may care for. Instead it will draw parents’ and providers’ attention to the relevant legal requirements set out in the EYFS. This means that when providers want to do something such as change the number of children they can look after, they simply need to check if the EYFS allows them to do this. Also included in the proposals are changes to the way Ofsted registers people wishing to provide childcare. Childminder applicants will be expected to apply for registration only when they are confident that they know and understand everything they need to do to meet requirements. This includes completing all of their training before registration. To ensure that parents get more information about the quality of provision for their children, Ofsted proposes to change the way it investigates concerns. In most cases where Ofsted receives information that that raises concerns, rather than simply investigating the issue, inspectors will carry out a full inspection and publish the report on Ofsted’s website. This will allow parents to have a fuller picture of provision and also allow providers more opportunity to set the concern in context. The timing of these inspections will depend on the nature of the concern and its potential seriousness for the welfare of children attending. In cases where the information, if true, would suggest there are or could be risks to children, we will carry out that inspection as quickly as possible. Ofsted is encouraging all those with an interest in early years, including those who use the services we inspect (parents and carers), the providers we regulate and inspect to respond to the consultation before Friday 6 April 2012. Notes to editors The consultation document ‘Regulation of providers on the Early Years Register’ is available online. Following the Tickell review of the Early Years Foundation Stage, the Department for Education has consulted on a response to the review including a revised Early Years Foundation Stage, which will take effect on 1 September 2012. The Office for Standards in Education, Children’s Services and Skills (Ofsted) regulates and inspects to achieve excellence in the care of children and young people, and in education and skills for learners of all ages. It regulates and inspects childcare and children’s social care, and inspects the Children and Family Court Advisory Support Service (Cafcass), schools, colleges, initial teacher training, work-based learning and skills training, adult and community learning, and education and training in prisons and other secure establishments. It assesses council children’s services, and inspects services for looked after children, safeguarding and child protection. [Contact:2325]"
/government/news/report-notes-importance-of-teaching-and-learning-in-pre-school,"Pre-school children from poorer backgrounds need the support of professionally trained teaching staff to stop them falling behind as soon as they reach school age, Ofsted said today. In its first stand-alone Early Years Annual Report , the inspectorate argues that the pre-reception age settings best equipped to help break ‘the cycle of disadvantage’ are those focused on helping children to learn at the earliest age. The report finds that the quality of provision in this sector has been rising in recent years – 78% of providers on the Early Years Register are now judged good or outstanding. However, barely a third of children from low income backgrounds reached a good level of development at the age of five last year – and in some areas it was less than a fifth. The report says that the current complexity and fragmentation of the sector means that neither the inspection, regulation nor information available about early years are clear enough for parents to compare quality across the different types of provision. The current system also fails to properly recognise the important role that schools play in providing early years education and childcare. This is creating barriers and ‘disincentives’ for schools that want to offer early education and childcare for younger children to ensure they are well prepared to start school. Other key findings in today’s report are: choosing the most suitable early years provider is often difficult for parents because the sector is ‘complex, opaque and of variable quality’ and the information available is unclear, patchy and inaccessible – particularly for those disadvantaged families who would most benefit from high quality provision providers in this sector need to be better held to account for their performance, particularly when they are in receipt of public money a lack of data and standardised assessment means that neither parents, providers nor the government are clear enough about whether children are ready for school data protection rules are currently limiting the information Ofsted can provide to parents about registered child-minders in their area In a keynote speech to mark the launch of the report, HM Chief Inspector, Sir Michael Wilshaw, said: Too many of our poorest children are getting an unsure start because the early years system is letting them down. We need a solution that is focused on the right things. It is no good a child attending early education if, when they get there, the provider isn’t effective. And what is most effective for the poorest children is the opportunity to learn. I know there are those who dislike the words ‘education’ and ‘teaching’ when it comes to very small children. They fear that teaching the smallest children will inevitably lead to less play and less freedom. Setting up play and learning as opposites is a false dichotomy. The best play is challenging. What children facing serious disadvantage need is high-quality, early education from the age of two delivered by skilled practitioners, led by a teacher, in a setting that parents can recognise and access. These already exist. They are called schools. Nick Hudson, Ofsted’s National Director for Early Education, said: Today’s report is just one chapter in a longer story about the importance of raising expectations for children from the most disadvantaged backgrounds and communities. Ofsted’s publication in June 2013, Unseen Children: Access and Achievement 20 years on, emphasised the importance of the early years for breaking the cycle of disadvantage. We believe that not enough is being done to support and encourage parents, but particularly those who need the most help, to secure for their children the benefit that the best early education and childcare can offer. This report unashamedly tries to break down the barriers between schools that teach the youngest children and the early years provision outside of schools. But we are clear that the most successful early years providers, whoever they are, are focused on helping children to learn. The report makes a series of detailed recommendations for a simpler, more flexible and accountable early years system, including: there should be an agreement nationally on a small number of words for different types of early years provision that would be consistently used the government should introduce a nationally comparable and standardised baseline assessment at the start of Reception, with external marking for both the baseline and Key Stage 1 assessments schools should be given greater flexibility to support children in their early years and be incentivised to do so – including by removing the requirement for separate registration, regulation and inspection for this younger age group and more recognition of school leaders who voluntarily make themselves accountable for raising attainment on entry through engagement with the local early years sector childminder inspection reports that are subsidised by the taxpayer should always be published with contact details so the public can make full use of them the new pupil premium for three and four-year-olds should be extended to two-year-olds at the earliest opportunity local councils that do not have enough high quality provision should consider incentives for schools to expand their provision either on-site or in linked provision The Annual Report includes tables comparing the local authority performance of children from low income backgrounds in the early years. Ofsted today also published a companion report, Are you ready? Good practice in school readiness . This is based on visits undertaken by inspectors to schools and early years settings to capture how the most successful providers ensured disadvantaged and vulnerable children were better prepared to start school.

/government/speeches/childrens-minister-tim-loughton-speaks-to-the-fostering-network,"I must start by paying my thanks to the Fostering Network. I admire it hugely and I am grateful to Robert, his team and all your members for their support over the last year. In particular, let me thank you for your involvement on the Foster Carers’ Charter and for the excellent guide you have developed on putting it into practice. Finally, let me pay special thanks to the Fostering Network for its support to local services in their recruitment of foster carers. The unique skills and dedication of carers are absolutely essential to improving the lives of looked after children. And the Government is very clear that we must attract more skilled people into fostering as a top priority. I saw a quote in the Guardian earlier this year in which a carer described her six years of fostering as ‘a very humbling job’ . I meet foster carers up and down the country all the time in my work - and I can assure you this modest, unassuming assessment of their role is characteristic of most. So, I am delighted we are now working with the Fostering Network to help local services recruit more of their calibre through programmes like Foster Carer Fortnight. In the last month, we have stepped through the gears once again. And there has been a lot of positive media around adoption with the launch of Give a Child a Home. Unfairly I think, fostering missed out on some of the headlines. Let me start therefore, by saying that this Government is as committed to fostering as ever. We did not publish Give a Child a Home to promote one service over another. We published it to get to grips with improving outcomes for kids in care. Whether it be in fostering; residential homes; special guardianship orders; or - for a small proportion - adoption. The Fostering Network’s role in reducing that gap between young people in care - and those living outside of care - has been particularly pronounced over the last year. Together, we launched the Foster Carers’ Charter in March. We published the revised regulations, guidance and national minimum standards in April. We rolled out the Fostering Changes parenting programme. And we have secured very nearly £2.5m in funding between 2011 and 2013 for multi-dimensional treatment foster care and KEEP, which help foster carers respond positively to the needs of the children in their care and address the treatment needs of foster children - particularly those with more challenging problems. But of course we always need to do more, not least at a time of growing numbers of children coming into care. And I thought the importance of your work was very effectively underlined at the launch of the report from the Safeguarding Children Research Initiative yesterday. Once again, we saw that the majority of vulnerable children who are abused and maltreated at home, go on to do better in terms of their wellbeing and stability when they are placed in the care of councils. For many of these children, this is thanks to the sensitive and expert care provided by their foster carers. In fact, we know that the vast majority of looked after young people - 74 per cent - are living with foster carers. But as I say, we understand that there is more to do. In particular, there is the need that the report correctly identifies for more specialist provision - to help children overcome the difficulties they experience. So, I can assure you now that next year will be just as busy as the last. Amongst other things, we will be rolling out extra support to the most vulnerable children. We will be looking for better ways to support foster carers. And we will be working hard to support both fostering agencies and local authorities. Let me take each of those areas in turn. Starting with vulnerable children. We know looked after children need three things in place to achieve their potential. First, they must receive good parenting from every person involved in their lives. Not least foster carers. Second, they need to be listened to and be given a real voice: a real say in the decisions that affect their future. And third, there must be stability in their lives. We are now tackling each of these areas and making good progress. For example, we are working to improve young people’s health; placement stability; the successful transition to adulthood; and the daily experience of being in care. I am also holding quarterly, face-to-face meetings with four groups of young people: those in care, those who have been adopted, children in residential homes and care leavers. And I have set up the Tell Tim website where looked after children and foster carers can write in and let me know their concerns direct. Finally of course, we are making huge strides to improve standards in education for our most vulnerable children. Almost every time I meet young people in care, they tell me they need to enjoy the same opportunities in the classroom as their peers. I am clear that this should mean providing extra support at every step of their education journey. So, in the early years we are providing a weekly entitlement to 15 hours of free early education to all two year olds in care. Giving them the opportunity to learn, play and gain the necessary skills to do well when they start school. We are allocating extra funding to schools to support the most disadvantaged pupils through the Pupil Premium. This will be allocated to all children who have been looked after for more than six months, as well as pupils on free school meals. We are ensuring looked after children have an entitlement to the new 16 to 19 bursary, worth £1200 per year - £400 more than they would have received under the Education Maintenance Allowance. And we are funding local authorities to provide a minimum £2000 higher education bursary to any care leaver starting a course of higher education - up until their 25th birthday. Why is this activity so important? It is important because a decent education is absolutely core to giving looked after children a level playing field in opportunities. My chief concern however - as minister for safeguarding - is to make sure children reach the school gates in the first place, and are ready to learn when they do. We launched Professor Munro’s review of child protection just a month after taking Government. And from the start, we wanted it to be different. Unlike other reviews of child protection, it was not commissioned as a knee-jerk response to a crisis. We gave Professor Munro all the time she needed to conduct a considered review, consulting the frontline, as well as children and young people. We are currently working our way through her recommendations. But I’m pleased to say I have already put in place three key principles for our work: First, reducing bureaucracy and prescription. Second, being child-centred. And third, trusting skilled frontline professionals to use their judgment. On this last point, I am unequivocal that the issue of trust is as relevant to fostering as it is to social care. Foster carers are consummate professionals and we need to treat them as such. For too long, this simply hasn’t happened. In the same Guardian article I mentioned at the start, Helen Clarke from the Fostering Network makes the point that ‘no-one becomes a foster carer for the money.’ I don’t dispute this. But I am very clear we must support families who open their doors to vulnerable children better than we have done in the past. We want this to happen in three ways: First, through trust. Second, by ensuring they are not let down financially. And third, by providing proper training. We introduced the new statutory framework and Foster Carers’ Charter to underline the importance of valuing foster carers, trusting them to take everyday decisions about their foster child, and involving them in care planning decisions. I have a map on my office wall reminding me exactly which areas have signed up - and which haven’t. In the new year, I will be doing a full audit of sign up to the charter and the Government will be gathering and disseminating good practice. I want all fostering services to be able to show that they have used the charter to engage with their foster carers, foster children and other partners on how to improve fostering services in their area. The anecdotal evidence I have so far is positive. I know Foster Care Associations around the country have been doing excellent work with local authorities to develop the charter and support local improvements. But I’m deeply concerned that foster carers are still telling me the revised fostering guidance is being followed well in some areas, poorly in others. My main bugbear is the lack of movement in some communities on the delegation of authority to foster carers. I was quite explicit about the importance of effective delegation of authority in my letter to directors of children’s services in August last year. Asking them to ‘give the maximum appropriate flexibility in making decisions relating to children in their care’. The Fostering Network has produced an excellent toolkit to help councils improve their practice in this area. And the Foster Carers’ Charter also refers to proper delegation to foster carers. I appreciate the difficulties for authorities who have to keep one eye on the legal framework governing parental responsibility. But we know proper delegation is vital to foster carers’ providing excellent parenting. And children in care have told me it is vital to giving them the same opportunities as their peers. There is no reason why a child should miss out on a school trip. It simply accentuates the feeling of difference between one child and another. In my book, this is a simple matter of trust. And I am of the belief that if someone has taken the decision to look after another person’s child, the very least we can do is treat them as adults. Quite clearly, this includes Government and that is why we are taking action in three significant areas. First, we are calling on councils to end the sclerotic red tape that prevents people stepping forward to become foster carers. Personally, I am particularly pleased that my colleague Grant Shapps, the housing minister, is issuing guidance shortly to councils, making it crystal clear they should consider how their actions will help people looking to adopt or foster a child. Currently there is a Catch-22 situation that is blighting prospective parents’ and carers’ efforts to do either: legislation rightly requires adopted and fostered children to have their own bedroom. But currently it is often difficult for prospective foster carers to obtain a larger council house before their application to adopt or foster is approved. The new guidance on allocating council homes will break down the barriers between different council departments, and ensure the needs of children will be considered. Along with the needs of those waiting to adopt or foster. The second area of Government support is a financial one. And I am delighted that our plans for the Universal Credit recognise the uniquely valuable role they play. Like now, we will be disregarding fostering payments when we work out carers’ entitlement to benefits, so families don’t lose out because of their goodwill. Single foster carers, or nominated members of a fostering couple, will not be expected to search or be available for work until their youngest foster child reaches 16. And if needed by the foster child, this may be extended to both members of a couple or until the child leaves care. Importantly, we also plan to introduce new provisions so that where a carer intends to continue fostering, they will be allowed up to eight weeks between placements before being expected to look for work. The third and final area is training. We understand that fostering is a 24/7 job that requires great skill. And I am pleased the Government is promoting the use of evidence-based interventions that help carers deal positively with the complex needs of looked after children. Among the interventions that we know work best are Multi-dimensional Treatment Foster Care and KEEP. The feedback I have looked at over the last few months from both MTFC and KEEP has been strong. Amongst other quotes, I have seen the following from a foster carer: “KEEP has taught me how to see behind the behaviour and anticipate possible problems.” And on MTFC, a quote from West Sussex Council saying: “We feel passionately that the MTFC model could be of much wider value to children.” I am very clear that we must continue to support foster carers to do the best possible job. To make them feel valued. And to recognise the life changing role they play. The final area I want to look at today, is support to fostering service providers and local authorities. I am deeply concerned that there is still a great deal of local variation at the moment in outcomes for looked after children. I can name one part of London where only 49 per cent of looked after children were in education, employment or training at 19. Equally, I can show you areas in the capital where 83 per cent are in education, employment and training . This is my great frustration. There are some local authorities doing outstanding work on fostering. But we are terrible at spreading best practice in this country. I took the decision to publish local authority performance tables to shine a light on this variability. One of the indicators will be on placement moves. And we will be taking tough action to deal with councils who are failing. I opened a centre in London four-and-a-half years ago called the Ealing Horizons Centre. It provides fabulous ‘one stop shop’ support to children in care in the borough for things like school, counselling and career advice. Some of the results it has achieved for their 400 plus children are quite extraordinary. Particularly in areas like the rates of children going on into higher education (18 per cent as compared to a national average of six per cent of looked after children). If outcomes and stability for vulnerable children are to improve, local authorities need to look at the way they strategically plan and commission services for looked after children. And they need to look at best practice and spread it more widely. Can Ealing be replicated in Leeds, Manchester or Birmingham? Or perhaps there are elements that can simply be cherry picked. On foster care specifically, I honestly don’t care whether a council uses in-house fostering services, agency services, or a combination of the two - just as long as they use the best services. I will say this though, many independent fostering providers I have seen are at the cutting edge of innovation and I can promise you they are worth looking at. The Fostering Network and its members are leading this innovation through the work they are doing with KPMG to trial social pedagogy in foster care. We piloted social pedagogy in children’s homes and I am a firm admirer of the child-centred, holistic approach it takes to service delivery. My one piece of advice today is that local authorities should not turn a blind eye to this. As strategic commissioners, they need to make sure markets are effectively developed and managed (including both in-house and external placements) to ensure the very best outcomes are achieved. At the very least, I want a level playing field between local authorities, and independent fostering agencies. There are more than 65,000 looked after children in this country. 48,500 of them are in foster care. If we don’t spread best practice more widely and encourage innovation, the gap in outcomes between the top 10,000 and bottom 10,000 will continue to remain unacceptably large. Over the next 18 months, I will do everything in my power to support councils, foster carers and fostering service providers to narrow those gaps. But in return, please do let us know where changes need to be made. And please do work to flatten out the huge gap in outcomes between local areas. Let me finish by again stressing this Government’s commitment to foster care. This is a long journey. But we have taken important first steps in the last 18 months. I want those steps to become a sprint in the years ahead. And I want outcomes for looked after children to be transformed in the process. Thank you."

Bids will be welcomed from a range of groups including teachers, charities, local authorities and academy sponsors. This new fund draws on President Barack Obama’s ‘Race to the Top’ programme. The pioneering scheme invites American states to apply for funding to trail-blaze bold and innovative approaches in schools. The EEF forms part of the Coalition Government’s drive to improve standards for all. It builds on the Pupil Premium for disadvantaged children, which will see schools receiving £625m in 2011-12, rising each year until 2014-15 when it will be worth £2.5bn. Ministers and the Sutton and Impetus Trusts believe that the EEF will create a lasting educational legacy for hundreds of thousands of children from poorer homes. Acting independently of Government, the Sutton Trust, in partnership with Impetus Trust, will: promote the fund to potential bidders including schools below the floor standards, local authorities, charities, public sector organisations, co-ops, mutuals, and social enterprises receive and assess all bids for bold and innovative educational projects on whether they provide value for money, are spread around the country and are deliverable work with applicants to develop any promising proposals that need extra support attract additional funding, knowledge and expertise on how to raise attainment evaluate the effectiveness of the projects that have been funded. Secretary of State for Education, Michael Gove, said: I am delighted that these leaders in social mobility will take forward this pioneering new fund for our poorest children. Few have done more to challenge educational inequality in this country than the Sutton Trust. It is unacceptable that just 40 pupils out of 80,000 on free school meals made it into Oxbridge last year. Opportunity must become more equal. This is why we must press ahead with our reforms and focus resources on improving the education of the poorest children. This fund, combined with the Pupil Premium, the expansion of the Academy programme, funding for more Teach First graduates and tough action to improve discipline, will help improve standards for children in our most challenging schools. Sir Peter Lampl, chairman of the Sutton Trust and chairman of the new fund said: The Fund is an unprecedented opportunity to create a lasting legacy to improve the life chances of the country’s most disadvantaged children and improve social mobility. In many ways this represents the culmination of the Sutton Trust’s work, and I am convinced that we will uncover highly cost-effective and innovative projects which will influence the way billions of public money is spent on supporting disadvantaged children. Daniela Barone Soares, Chief Executive of Impetus Trust, said: We are delighted to be one of the drivers behind an investment of this scale with such potential to make a difference for disadvantaged children. The gap in attainment between disadvantaged children and their better-off peers results in an impoverished society, and has existed for far too long. We look forward to applying our expertise to develop and scale up education projects so that many more disadvantaged students are able to get the support they need to succeed. Selection criteria for bids from interested groups will be unveiled in the early summer when the fund will be officially launched. The first round of grants will be made later this year. Notes to editors The Education Endowment Fund was announced in November 2010 by the Department. The total fund is now £125 million. It will run over a minimum of ten years. Selection criteria for bids will be published in the early summer, and the first projects will be funded later this year. The Sutton Trust, in partnership with Impetus Trust, was appointed to administer the Education Endowment Fund following an open competition undertaken by the Department for Education, which attracted interest from 14 organisations. The Sutton Trust is the lead partner and will be responsible for setting up the new Education Endowment Fund charity. It will be held to account by the Department by the conditions set out in the grant funding agreement and through formal reviews. For the first two years of the fund, applications will only be accepted from, or in partnership with, underperforming primary and secondary schools in England. Grants will aim to raise the attainment of disadvantaged children and will be available not just to schools or local authorities but also to voluntary and community sectors, public sector organisations, co-ops, mutuals, charities and social enterprises. A key strand of the programme will be to commission robust evaluations of the projects piloted, to create a bank of approaches proven to work at improving attainment of disadvantaged pupils. Race to the Top is a US programme that was announced by President Barack Obama and Secretary of Education Arne Duncan in July 2009. The Sutton Trust is investing £750,000 in cash to underpin the development of the new charity, while Impetus Trust is committing £250,000. Both trusts are also making substantial in-kind contributions of staff resources and expertise. The new charity will also be able to draw down a small amount from the fund to cover administration costs. The Sutton Trust aims to improve social mobility and address educational disadvantage. Since 1997 the Trust has funded over 100 research studies and has profoundly influenced the national agenda. It is however primarily a do tank and has funded a wide range of initiatives, from early years, through primary and secondary schooling and access to higher education and the professions. These initiatives have been thoroughly evaluated and those that have been shown to be cost effective, for example summer schools and partnerships between independent and state schools, have been taken up by others, notably Government. The Impetus Trust exists to help break the inter-generational cycle of poverty by helping the charities and social enterprises it supports to achieve a transformational change in their performance. The ultimate goal is to enable these charities to have a greater impact on the lives of economically disadvantaged people. Through its financial support and deployment of high-calibre experts and co-investment partners, Impetus has helped its portfolio charities grow their income by an average of 31% a year and increase the number of people they help by 40% a year. Since actively focusing on this leveraged approach, Impetus has been able to generate an additional £4 of funding for its charities, for every £1 it invests. [Contact:997]"
/government/news/sarah-teather-responds-to-the-unicef-report-on-childrens-wellbeing,"Responding to UNICEF’s report ‘Child well-being in the UK, Spain and Sweden: The role of inequality and materialism’, Children’s Minister Sarah Teather said: We know strong, stable families are the bedrock of a successful society. We want to make sure all families have the help and support they need. That’s why we are consulting on plans to help parents better balance work and family life through more flexible and generous parental leave and flexible working. We are also looking at ways to give families better access to advice and support on parenting. On consumerism We share UNICEF’s concerns about the rise of consumerism among children, and it’s worrying to see that in some cases parents are under the same pressures. We are clear this needs to be tackled and are currently working with businesses and regulators to implement the recommendations from Reg Bailey’s review on commercialisation and sexualisation of children. On social mobility We’re committed to tackling inequalities so every child, regardless of social background, has the opportunity to thrive. That’s why we are extending free early education to all disadvantaged two-year-olds so every child starts school ready to learn. We are providing extra funding for poorer pupils through the pupil premium, and we are transforming our education system to raise standards and equip all pupils with the skills they need to succeed. For the most troubled families, we are also providing funding through the Early Intervention Grant to address the underlying problems which can have such a negative impact on children’s future happiness, attainment and success.

/government/news/tackling-the-root-causes-of-poverty-and-disadvantage,"The government is today asking local communities, voluntary groups and charities for their views on a new strategy to tackle the root causes of poverty and disadvantage. A consultation published today sets out a new approach to tackling poverty, building on Frank Field’s Independent review on poverty and life chances and Graham Allen’s work on early intervention. The government is clear that tackling child poverty requires more than simply treating the short-term symptoms of poverty or moving families across an arbitrary income line. Making real progress requires a new focus on promoting fairness, opportunity and social mobility - to help address ingrained patterns of worklessness, family breakdown and educational under-achievement. Launching the new strategy consultation, Children’s Minister Sarah Teather said: For too long a child’s birth has dictated their fate. It’s a scandal that in today’s society we still have 2.8 million children living in poverty in the UK - let down by a lack of opportunity and aspiration. The best way to eradicate child poverty is to address the causes of poverty, rather than only treat the symptoms. Frank Field’s independent report on poverty and life chances, published earlier this month, is a welcome reminder of how important early years childcare and education is to setting a child on the road to success and out of poverty. That’s why we are reforming Sure Start services to target the most needy and are extending the offer of 15-hours of free childcare a week to all disadvantaged 2-year-olds. And through the pupil premium schools will be able to support the poorest at every stage of their education.

/government/news/government-sets-out-vision-to-support-parents-and-families,"Review of early years qualifications announced Nine local areas to trial payment by results in children’s centres Early years qualifications are to be reviewed to make sure they are sufficiently rigorous and high quality, Children’s Minister Sarah Teather announced today as part of wider reforms to early education. A highly skilled, graduate-led workforce is crucial to making sure children develop well and are ready for school. The government wants to raise the status of the professionals working with young children to make sure they have the skills they need. The government has also today confirmed that nine local authorities will be the first to trial payment by results for children’s centres. They will test rewards for reaching the most vulnerable families, improving family health and wellbeing, and raising attainment of children at age five. Today’s announcements are included in a new vision set out by the government for families in the foundation years. Families can access a parent-friendly version by the charity 4Children, Families in the Foundation Years: From Pregnancy to Five, which sets out what mothers and fathers can expect from pregnancy until their child reaches the age of five. Sarah Teather said: Parents are the most important influence in a child’s early life. The experiences of children in their earliest years, good or bad, can shape their future life chances for years to come. That’s why we want to support families to bring up their children and raise the status of the foundation years. Today, with 4Children, we have set out in one place what every mother and father should expect from pregnancy right through to when their child is five. This brings together everything parents need to know to help their child develop well, stay healthy and be ready for school. Alongside parents, well-qualified and motivated professionals working in the early years can make a real difference to children’s early development. I am today announcing a review of early years qualifications, led by Professor Cathy Nutbrown, to make sure the people working with our youngest children have the skills they need. I also want to encourage more talented people to work in the foundation years and make sure the qualifications they take are rigorous and offer opportunities to progress, as there are in school teaching. The government has today set out plans to strengthen the early years workforce, including: An independent review of early years qualifications. The review will consider the content of current early years qualifications and how they could be strengthened. 10 new ‘Early Years Teaching Centres’ to be developed by Pen Green Research Base. Based on the teaching schools model, the centres will help to raise standards across the early years workforce. The 10 centres are being selected over the summer. Looking at how the specialist leader of education (SLE) role could be adapted to the foundation years for qualified teachers and early years professionals. Funding for the National College to provide 800 places on the National Professional Qualification in Integrated Centre Leadership course over the next two years. The government expects all existing and aspiring children’s centre leaders to take this qualification in due course. The Government has asked Professor Cathy Nutbrown to do an independent review of early years qualifications to consider how to strengthen current qualifications and look at career progression of people working in the foundation years. It will consider how to ensure that new entry qualifications are of a high standard and meet the needs of employers, and offer scope for progression. It will run alongside a review of the standards for awarding the Early Years Professional Status being conducted by the Children’s Workforce Development Council (CWDC). Earlier this month the government published a revised Early Years Foundation Stage for consultation and set out a new core purpose for children’s centres - more focused on supporting outcomes, particularly for the most vulnerable families. The Government wants local authorities and children’s centres to think more about how they reach and support the most vulnerable families in their areas, and how they can involve parents more actively in running centres. Nine local authorities, announced today, will become the first to trial payment by results in children’s centres - with up to 21 further trials to be announced early in the autumn. The experience of the trial areas will help the government and local authorities develop a final set of measures so payment by results can be rolled out nationally from 2013-14. The measures to be tested by the trial areas include: Early Years Foundation Stage Profile assessments - to narrow the gap in attainment at age five so more children start school achieving the expected level. Breastfeeding prevalence at 6-8 weeks - to be developed in partnership with the Department of Health’s plan for a Health Premium for public health outcomes. Parenting/home learning environment - for example, completion of evidence based parenting programmes by vulnerable families. Sustained contact with families in greatest need - so that children’s centres are targeting families most in need of their services effectively. The Government has also announced that it will be creating a new role to help support outreach with vulnerable families through children’s centres. The appointed outreach system leader will act as an advocate for evidence based outreach and family support programmes. Independent reviews conducted by Graham Allen, Frank Field and Dame Clare Tickell have all highlighted just how important pregnancy and the first five years of a child’s life are in providing children with the foundations they need to thrive and succeed in life. Evidence suggests there are five critical factors in the foundation years: Children’s health in early life Good maternal mental health Quality of parenting and parent-child relationships Learning activities High-quality early education The 4Children’s website, part-funded by the government, has been developed with experts in the early years sector. Parents will be able to find information on ante-natal classes, flexible working and childcare in their area. Designed with mums and dads in mind, it is a useful reference point for parents to help them make decisions to balance their work and family lives more easily. Anne Longfield OBE, Chief Executive of 4Children said: Whether you are a mum or a dad, whether you have just seen the positive result on a pregnancy test or are looking for your child’s first school, this new website from early years experts is spelling out the A to Z of all your unanswered questions. Parents-to-be suddenly face a million decisions that will affect the life of their child: they find themselves having to navigate their way through a maze of conflicting facts and figures from blogs and personal websites offering advice. Getting the information and advice you need into one easy to find place is important because it helps you to give your child the best future. Parents tell us that good information is almost as important as good housing or the community where they live, and most tell us that they don’t know where to find it. And the more information a parent has, the more they feel they are in the driving seat of their child’s future. Professor Nutbrown said: I am delighted to be invited to lead this review. High-quality provision for young children means that we need skilled and knowledgeable people in the workforce. I will be looking at ways in which we can strengthen qualifications and improve pathways to support career progression in the sector, to the benefit of young children, their families, and those who work in the early childhood sector. I look forward to working with the wide range of colleagues who have an interest in this crucial issue. Public Health Minister Anne Milton said: All the evidence indicates that the early years play a significant and formative role in shaping your health, wealth and happiness for the rest of your life. That is why we need to focus on this. By increasing numbers of health visitors and extending the Family Nurse Partnership we want to offer the support that families need right through pregnancy and the early months and years of life. The new national Health Visitor Taskforce will provide strong leadership and ensure the new health visiting service model is universally adopted by 2015. I am delighted former health visitor Dame Elizabeth Fradd has agreed to chair the taskforce. Notes to editors This press notice applies to England only. The Families in the Foundation Years document for parents is published today on the Department for Education’s website. The Department’s strategic partner 4Children has produced a parent-friendly version. The new site, Families in the Foundation Years: From Pregnancy to Age five, is the result of a partnership between the government and charities that work with families with young children and aims to provide the best advice and information to parents. The Department for Education has also published today a document for the sector which sets out in more detail the policy proposals for reforming early years education and the workforce. The government announced on the 6 July that it was providing up to £3million for up to 30 local areas to trial payment by results in children’s centres. The first wave of local areas has been announced today. They are: Southampton Oxfordshire Oldham Gloucestershire Devon Croydon Blackpool Barnsley Barking and Dagenham The government is not proposing to undertake payment by results directly with individual children’s centres, although we expect trial local authorities to explore this in their local areas. We are intending that payment by results is trialled at two levels: National= DfE to local authority Local = Local authority to individual children’s centre providers The government announced on 6 July plans to make the free entitlement more flexible for parents, reform to children’s centres, and a new EYFS framework.

/government/news/top-providers-urged-to-get-ready-for-two-year-old-education-offer,"Elizabeth Truss has called on LAs to ensure that funding reaches the front line. The government has today (27 November 2012) published local authority allocations to deliver 15 hours a week early education to 130,000 two-year-olds from September next year. This funding will help ensure more nurseries keep the best staff and give more children access to the high-quality early education they need to help them get on in life. The funding is being provided at a flat rate per child per hour (adjusted for the area’s average costs). Childcare Minister Elizabeth Truss has called for funding to be passed on in full to providers to ensure that high-quality staff are recruited and retained and so that excellent operators are encouraged to open in areas of scarce provision. Two-year-olds in good and outstanding settings see real developmental benefits according to government research, whereas two-year-olds in poorer quality settings are no better off than those who stay at home. All the evidence suggests that staff quality is the key determinant of improved outcomes. The government’s aspiration is therefore that all eligible two-year-olds are able to receive early education in good and outstanding settings. To this end, local authorities will receive an average of £5.09 per child per hour, for statutory places, which they are expected to pass on in full to schools, nurseries and childminders. This is significantly above the market rate of £4.13 (Daycare Trust figures) which providers charge and will enable high quality staff to be retained, recruited and trained. A new online tool from [Ofsted] also launched today. Parent View [https://parentview.ofsted.gov.uk/ Parent View] will allow parents and providers to compare how many good and outstanding providers there are in each local area. Parents will also know whether the full allocations have been passed on to providers as the Department will publish details of local authority spend on its website. The government is also calling on local authorities to raise awareness so that as many families as possible take up the offer. In future, funding to councils will be based on the number of participating children. Less money will go to local authorities that have not ensured parents are taking up these places - in other words, they will be funded on a ‘use it or lose it’ basis. In total, local authorities will receive more than half a billion pounds to fund two-year-olds places next year. Funding will increase so that from September 2014, 260,000 two-year-olds benefit. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said: From 2013, 130,000 of the most disadvantaged two-year-olds will be eligible for 15-hours of free childcare a week with double that number set to benefit the following year. Today we’re letting local authorities know the money they will receive to offer these free places and make a huge difference to hard-pressed families. Good quality childcare gives children a headstart even before they walk through the school gates for the first time. No child should miss out on this just because of the circumstances of their birth. Elizabeth Truss, Education and Childcare Minister, said: I am calling on schools, nurseries and childminders to step up to the challenge so that all two-year-olds from low-income families are in good or outstanding settings. We know that only high-quality early education has a long-term impact on school readiness. Therefore, I am urging local authorities to pass on all the funding for places to the front line, so that providers are able to retain and recruit the top quality staff that our youngsters deserve. Kathy Sylva, Professor of Educational Psychology at Oxford University, said: Research from several countries shows that the participation of two year olds in early learning and childcare has benefits for their development. A recent study by the University of Oxford and NatCen Social Research shows that two year olds who attended high quality childcare made more progress than children from similar backgrounds who remained at home or attended lower quality provision. The quality of childcare can make a big difference to the development of young children, especially the most vulnerable. The government has also announced capital funding allocations to councils totalling £100 million, to help build, extend or improve nurseries and early education facilities. [Contact:997]"
/government/speeches/hmcis-monthly-commentary-october-2015,"As Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector, I am in the privileged position of being able to talk on a frequent basis to hundreds of school leaders, teachers and inspectors from across the country about the important issues facing our education system today. This dialogue gives me a valuable insight into what is happening in the nation’s schools and colleges. Along with the evidence from the thousands of inspections that Ofsted carries out each year, it helps me to focus on the issues and challenges that face us. My Annual Report, which is presented to Parliament towards the end of each calendar year, has traditionally been the main opportunity for chief inspectors to provide a ‘state of the nation’ view of overall standards in our schools and colleges. In keeping with this tradition, I very much look forward to sharing the findings of my fourth Annual Report in a few weeks’ time. However, when preparing my Annual Report commentary each year, the most difficult challenge is always deciding what I have to leave out, such is the wealth of material I have to draw on. This is why I am keen to start commenting more regularly on different aspects of our education system, based on emerging inspection evidence, my own first-hand observations and the considered views of those working in the system. For the first of these short commentaries, I want to focus on the factors that lie behind the strong performance of England’s primary schools and how these need to be carried through to our secondary schools. In the coming months, I will be shining the spotlight on other important issues, including governance, careers guidance and the teaching of science and modern languages in primary schools. I hope they will serve as useful additions to our collective understanding of these issues and to the ongoing debates in which teachers, governors, education commentators and parents are all engaged. Our primary schools have never been so good I am starting my series of short commentaries with some reflections on the state of England’s primary schools in 2015. I think we have real grounds for great optimism here. There can be no doubt that, against a number of measures, primary schools are doing well. The last few years have seen a steady rise in the achievement of pupils taking the SATs at the end of key stage 2. Compared with 2012, over 60,000 more primary school pupils this year achieved a good level of reading and writing, and a standard of mathematics that will set them up confidently for secondary school. Similarly, the proportion of 6 and 7-year-olds reaching the expected standards in literacy and mathematics at the end of key stage 1 has also improved over this period and now stands at around 90% for both. However, we do not have to rely on test results alone. Our own Ofsted inspection evidence and judgements very much confirm this upward trajectory of improvement. There were 2,293 more good and outstanding primary schools in the last academic year than in 2011 to 2012 and 219 fewer inadequate ones. These are highly impressive and encouraging statistics. So what has driven this improving performance? I would contend that a key factor has been the greater emphasis on the structure of language in the primary curriculum and its focus on ensuring that all pupils get a solid grounding in the basic knowledge, understanding and skills that form the foundation of children’s learning. Of course, this focus on structure started some years ago with the national literacy and numeracy strategies. However, there can be little doubt that it has been sharpened still further over the past 5 years. The emphasis on high-quality, effective synthetic phonics teaching from the early years onwards is an integral part of the Teachers’ Standards guidance published 4 years ago. Teachers have increasingly got to grips with the rules and the lexicon of phonics. Terms like blending and segmenting, phonemes and digraphs are firmly embedded in the classroom vocabulary. More importantly, teachers have become proficient in teaching phonics in a way that engages and enthuses the youngest children in primary schools. While far from universally popular when first introduced, the emphasis on phonics teaching is certainly bearing fruit. As noted recently by Schools Minister Nick Gibb, the national phonics screening check demonstrates continuing, strong progress in this vital area of learning for the youngest pupils. Surely nobody can still convincingly argue that systematic phonics isn’t the most effective method of teaching children to read. The structured yet engaging way in which this is being done is something my inspectors increasingly report. Take, for example, the line below from one recently published inspection report of a nursery and infant school in Devon . “Teachers and teaching assistants take every opportunity during the day to extend pupils’ phonic awareness, for example pronouncing names of plants and leaves correctly.” As well as developing their skills, many primary schools are taking active steps to instill a sense of joy and enthusiasm for reading among their pupils. Here’s a line from another recent inspection report , this time a primary school in Cambridgeshire. “A computer-based reading system allows pupils to practise reading both in school and at home. The school library contains an extremely wide selection of stimulating fiction and non-fiction texts to support learning across subjects and reading for pleasure.” I believe the flair and fluency with which young children are reading as a result of the now well-established teaching of phonics helps explain the progress we’ve also seen in writing over the last few years. There is plenty of evidence to suggest children’s greater confidence in decoding words is improving their ability to encode them for spelling. In addition, the focus that many schools now place on children reading aloud regularly from books that are well suited to their level of knowledge helps them practise their skills and gain confidence as readers. The strong focus we now see on higher standards of grammar and punctuation from the earliest years of primary school is also something I welcome. In one Manchester primary school, a recent inspection found that: “Teachers have exceptionally good subject knowledge in English. In class, they focus on developing pupils’ understanding of the structure of the English language and the importance of good grammar. Across the school, including in the early years, pupils are encouraged to use similes, “interesting adjectives” and alliteration to improve their written work. Teachers always check pupils’ spelling and punctuation.” Generations of adults have had cause to lament the fact that they were never taught the basics of grammar at school. Thankfully, the misguided ideologies of the 1970s and 80s are now being successfully countered. Today’s primary school literacy lessons abound with talk of conjunctions and prepositions, of passive and active tenses, antonyms and ellipses. Children and their teachers are using terminology and concepts that have been absent from the classroom for some considerable time. This altogether more structured and systematic approach to learning grammar, spelling and punctuation throughout the primary years means that our children are becoming more confident in tackling challenging writing tasks. As a consequence, the vast majority are ready for the transition to secondary school education. This is good for our children and it’s good for the country. However, our report last year on provision for the most able pupils and our recent survey on the effectiveness of the curriculum at key stage 3 gave me great cause for concern about the transition from primary to secondary education. Both these surveys identified that pupils, who have achieved so much at primary school, are not supported well enough to build on that momentum when they enter secondary school. My inspectors tell me that much of the good, structured work done in primary schools on understanding and using correct grammar, both when writing and when speaking, is lost when pupils enter the secondary phase. Worse still, the rigour with which spelling, punctuation and grammar is being taught at primary stage is often not developed sufficiently at secondary stage, especially in the foundation subjects like history and geography. This slows down all children, but is particularly damaging for the most able pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds who disproportionately fail to fulfil their earlier potential when they come to sit their GCSE examinations. In 2014, for example, around 5,000 disadvantaged pupils who attained the highest levels at the end of key stage 2 failed to achieve a grade B in English and mathematics at age 16. This is little short of a tragedy for the young people concerned and an enormous waste of talent for our country. I know that Ministers are worried about how the move from primary to secondary education is being managed. I’m aware they are looking at the idea of introducing resit tests in year 7 for those pupils who don’t achieve the expected standards at age 11. They can certainly count on my full support. As I made clear in the key stage 3 report, I stand fully behind any action that will sharpen the focus on the vital transition between primary and secondary school."

/government/news/special-educational-needs-reform-draft-legislation-published,"The government has today published draft provisions to improve the support provided to children and young people with special educational needs ( SEN ), and to their parents. These provide for: a new duty for joint commissioning which will require local authorities and health bodies to take joint responsibility for providing services a requirement on local authorities to publish a local offer of services for disabled children and young people and those with special educational needs new protections for young people aged 16 to 25 in further education and a stronger focus on preparing them for adulthood parents and young people, for the first time, to be entitled to have a personal budget, extending their choice and control over their support further education colleges for the first time and all academies, including free schools, to have the same duties as maintained schools to safeguard the education of children and young people with SEN Previously further education colleges had not been subject to SEN duties. The provisions relating to academies reflect the requirements currently in the majority of funding agreements signed since the introduction of the Academies Act 2010. Placing these requirements on the face of the legislation will give greater clarity to academies, parents and young people and will ensure further education colleges face the same requirements for the first time. The draft provisions would ensure that parents, young people and children are on the same footing whether they attend (or wish to attend) a maintained school, an academy, or a further education or sixth-form college. Sarah Teather, Minister for Children and Families, said: As the Paralympics are powerfully reminding us, disability is not necessarily a bar to outstanding achievement as long as people are given the right opportunities. We must do all we can to ensure that our schools give those with special educational needs and disabilities the best possible start in life. Too many parents have faced bureaucratic barriers. We are making it easier for parents to access help for their children. And we will empower parents and young people, giving them greater control over the services they receive, by putting them in charge of personal budgets. We are also increasing rights and protections for disabled young people in further education to prepare them for adulthood and paid work better. Taken together, our reforms package is giving young people with special educational needs the platform to succeed. The Minister of State for Children and Families has today written to the chair of the Education Select Committee to seek the committee’s agreement to consider the draft SEN and disability provisions. The committee will decide formally later this week if it is willing to carry out pre-legislative scrutiny of these draft provisions. The government looks forward to receiving views and feedback on the draft clauses, whilst it continues to learn from its pathfinder programme, before introducing legislation at a later date. In September 2011, the Departments for Education and Health appointed 20 pathfinders (involving health and local authority partnerships in 31 areas across England) to test ways of achieving these reforms. Pathfinders have already played a valuable role in supporting the development of draft provisions and evidence emerging from the pathfinder programme will continue to inform regulations and guidance over the coming months. Two of the delivery partners for the reform programme, Preparing for Adulthood and the Early Support Trust, have been working with pathfinders on a series of case studies describing their experiences as SEND pathfinders and setting out some of the early learning from their work. The first case studies are now available for download on the ‘Food for thought’ pages of the SEND Pathfinder website . Further case studies will be added in future. The department is also sending out an invitation to disabled children and young people and those with special educational needs to join the young people’s advisory group (YPAG). This group will influence the policy making process by bringing disabled young people together with ministers and officials who are taking forward the government’s reforms set out in its green paper, ‘Support and aspiration: a new approach to special educational needs and disability’. It will enable those working on the reforms on a day-to-day basis to hear directly from disabled young people and test out policy proposals. Further information is available in Sarah Teather’s written ministerial statement , available from the announcements section."
/government/news/major-milestone-for-early-education,"There are now more than 10,000 early years professionals in England, the government announced today. Nafeesah Rafiq of Leicester is the 10,000th person to achieve Early Years Professional Status (EYPS). She studied at the University of Northampton, and currently works at a private day nursery called Bright Bees, which has been rated by Ofsted as good across all categories. Established in 2007, the Early Years Professional Status programme has been helping people get the skills they need to become graduate leaders in early education. Sarah Teather, Minister for Children and Families, said: Early years professionals are making a huge difference to young children’s lives. I am delighted that the Teaching Agency has reached the major milestone of 10,000 early years professionals. This means that more and more skilled professionals are helping young children to get the best possible start in life. We know that they make a particular impact on those who are among the most disadvantaged. I hope more and more talented and passionate people sign up to this programme so that as many children as possible are well prepared for school. Nafeesah Rafiq said: The Early Years Professional Status programme has been a challenging and rewarding experience. I originally studied to be a pharmacist but after achieving my Masters degree I changed career direction and found a passion for working with children. I would definitely recommend EYPS to other graduates. Lin Hinnigan, Interim Chief Executive of the Teaching Agency, said: I am proud that the EYPS programme has reached this milestone and would like to congratulate Nafeesah on being the 10,000th person to reach this gold standard and wish her the very best in her early years career. Every day, throughout England, early years professionals like Nafeesah are working with our under-fives and their families to make a world of difference to our young children’s lives. Early years professionals help to raise the quality of childcare and improve outcomes for all our children. I would like to thank our training providers, employers and above all the practitioners who make the Early Years Professional Status programme such a success.

/government/speeches/nicky-morgan-improving-child-literacy-in-england,"Thank you very much for that kind introduction. It’s brilliant to be here today. And it’s a huge pleasure to be working with David [Walliams]. When you want to get more children reading, the support of one of the most popular children’s authors in the country is absolutely invaluable. David and I have joined forces because we each believe in the importance of reading. Standing here, it’s easy to forget that there are still, in this country, too many children for whom reading is a closed book. One in 5 children still leaves primary school unable to read well enough to do well at secondary school - a figure that rises to 1 in 3 of our poorest children. And what makes that even more heartbreaking is that they’re not just missing out on the immense joy of reading - that magical sense of being taken out of yourself, exploring new worlds and discovering characters you grow to love that stay with you for the rest of your life; but they’re also locked out of all of the opportunities the rest of their education has to offer. It’s no surprise that people with strong reading skills are more likely to succeed at school, achieve good qualifications, find a rewarding and enjoyable career, even to enjoy good health. Those who miss out on reading all too often miss out on those other advantages too. Throughout their lives as adults, their problems with reading will all too often translate into frustration and failure, leaving them unable to realise their talents - something I often hear first-hand as a constituency member of Parliament. That’s why we view our mission to tackle child illiteracy as a cornerstone of our commitment to social justice. It’s why this one-nation government is absolutely determined to make sure that every child, no matter where they live or what their background, learns to read confidently. So we’ve set ourselves an ambitious challenge over the next 5 years: to make children in this country become the most proficient in Europe. It’s a bold ambition. Although international surveys show that children in this country are relatively good in reading, our 9- and 10-year-olds are still ranked sixth in Europe, putting us behind places like Northern Ireland and Finland. And of course, even if we run to catch up, those other countries won’t stand still. So we don’t just need to match them; we need to overtake them. Now that won’t be easy. But that international study of 9- and 10-year-olds - The Progress in International Reading Literacy Study - reveals something very interesting. The best readers in this country are already the best readers in Europe – beating even the top performers in Finland, number 1 in the rankings. What’s holding us back is a long tail of underachievement, which leaves far too many young people behind, in particular the most disadvantaged. That long tail of underachievement is nothing short of a scandal, and it’s why we need to help all schools and all pupils to reach the high level that our best readers are already achieving. Which is why we’re here today. Over the last 5 years we’ve taken some big steps forward, starting from the very beginning of children’s education, because getting reading right at the start of primary sets up a virtuous circle. Children are more confident, so they read more, so they become even more confident and keep on reading more. Before children even arrive in schools, our reforms to early years are helping them to acquire the language, skills and vocabulary they need to learn to read. Our reformed national curriculum and more demanding qualifications and accountability system will set higher standards for literacy at every age. More 6-year-olds are already on track to becoming strong readers through phonics. And as the results published today have shown, that adds up to 120,000 more 6-year-olds on track to becoming strong readers in just 4 years. We’ve invested in helping more schools to improve their phonics teaching because international evidence shows that systematic phonics is the most effective way to teach all children to read. Phonics involves teaching pupils the basic letter sounds of the English language, and how they blend together to form words in a structured and systematic fashion - just like you do here at Charles Dickens Primary School. And I’d particularly like to recognise the work of the Minister of State for Schools Nick Gibb, who is championing this work. We know that 99% of pupils who met the expected standard in the phonics check in 2014 went on to achieve or exceed the expected level in reading at the end of key stage 1 this year, helping drive up the overall number achieving or exceeding that level from 85% to 90% in just 5 years. At the end of primary school, we’ve seen the number of pupils meeting the expected standard in reading rise, which translates to over 33,000 children in the last 5 years alone. And reading well at primary school is the best preparation for doing well at secondary. Our reformed curriculum and exams mean that children are now being introduced to more stretching literature and studying more ambitious GCSEs and A levels . And because we don’t want any young people to fall behind, we’ve changed the rules so that every 16-year-old who doesn’t achieve a C grade in English GCSE has to continue to study the subject until the age of 18. This year, that translated to over 4,000 more passes in English than the year before - thousands more young people starting adult life with one of the most crucial qualifications which employers expect and demand. We’re making sure that no child falls through the cracks and is at risk of being left behind. We’re starting children off at the beginning of primary school with phonics and using the phonics check to see that every child has made a good start to reading. That’s why we’re also introducing resits in year 7 for children who don’t reach the required level at the end of primary, and after the age of 16, for young people who fall behind at GCSE . These changes have already achieved results. And I want to take this opportunity to thank every single teacher, all over the country, who has worked hard to drive up standards. But if we want to become the best in Europe, these improvements won’t take us far enough. Now we’re going further. We’re already raising standards of what we expect children to achieve at key stage 2 - raising the bar to encourage more children to work at the level top performers have already reached, to raise standards overall. To increase children’s enthusiasm for reading, earlier this summer I announced that we’re working with The Reading Agency to extend their popular Chatterbooks scheme, setting up brand new book clubs in hundreds more primary schools all over the country. We’re also supporting The Reading Agency to get 8-year-olds enrolled at their local library and into the library habit early. We know that library users are much more likely to read in their own time than non-library users - accessing the existing 3,142 public libraries open in this country. And today I can announce that we will do more to ensure all schools learn from what the best schools, like Charles Dickens Primary, and from what those around the world are doing to make sure every pupil is able to read well. Evidence provided by organisations such as the Education Endowment Foundation offers invaluable information on which approaches are most effective. And we’ll encourage schools to follow this evidence, and to share their successes helping to drive up standards right across the country. And we’ll keep encouraging schools to work together with the specific aim of improving literacy. Already in 8 phonics partnerships across the country, schools that excel at teaching early reading are supporting other schools that want to improve. As well as how to read, we want all children to get to know the classics of English literature, especially if these books are not on their bookshelves at home. Our ambition is that every secondary school should have sets of a wide range of classics so that whole classes can enjoy them together - books I loved as a teenager by authors like Jane Austen, Charles Dickens or Emily Brontë. I am delighted that a number of publishers are currently exploring how to make collections of our greatest novels available to schools at minimal cost - and I encourage more to get involved. Schools like St George’s Church of England Primary in Battersea, which is being visited today by the Minister of State for Schools Nick Gibb - a school which, despite many of its pupils coming from a high level of deprivation, demonstrates that disadvantage need not be a barrier to reading and writing well. But we won’t just achieve our goal through schools and the government working alone. The voluntary sector is playing a key role in raising literacy and I want to pay particular tribute to the ‘Read On. Get On’ campaign for their work in not only raising the profile of this important issue, but also in bringing together schools, charities and businesses committed to improving young people’s life chances. And as the ‘Read On. Get On’ campaign has already highlighted, perhaps more than any other group, the support of families is crucial. We want as many parents as possible to get behind our ambition, and to help their children to become excellent readers. We’ll be releasing new resources to help them do just that. We will strengthen our emphasis on literacy in the critical early years because we know that by the age of 5, children from better-off backgrounds are over a year ahead in vocabulary compared to their disadvantaged peers, according to evidence from the Millennium Cohort Study. So I am also announcing the launch today of an updated guide for parents - 4Children’s ‘What to expect, when?’ - which helps parents and carers understand how their child is learning and developing during their first 5 years. It will emphasise the importance of language, communication and literacy and provides links to excellent supporting activities and resources. There is no silver bullet, no magic wand we can wave to magically transform literacy for every child in this country. But we owe it to our young people to explore every possible path when it comes to getting them reading well, to break down any barriers, support any who are left behind, to introduce every child from every background to our incredibly rich heritage of world-famous children’s literature. Then we can trust those books to do the rest. As Roald Dahl wrote: Matilda’s strong young mind continued to grow, nurtured by the voices of all those authors who had sent their books out into the world like ships on the sea. These books gave Matilda a hopeful and comforting message: you are not alone. Every single child in this country deserves to hear that message too - deserves to travel the world by the power of imagination, invention and glorious words. That’s why we want to make this country the best in Europe, if not the world. And that’s why we’ve all come here today. Thank you again to David for his support, and to all of you for working with us to make this ambition happen. In 5 years’ time, we can start a new chapter as the best readers in Europe, giving every child in this country, no matter where they live or what their background, the chance to become the author of their own life story."
/government/speeches/more-affordable-childcare,"Today the government is publishing ‘More affordable childcare’ , which sets out our plans for improving the supply of affordable childcare. Reliable and affordable childcare is vital to giving parents the choice to get into and remain in work. We know that for many parents, before and after school and holiday care is the most difficult and costly to find. ‘More affordable childcare’ sets out the government’s plans to help working parents access the childcare they need when they need it, in particular by: helping schools to offer affordable after school and holiday care, either alone or working with private and voluntary providers enabling nurseries to expand by reducing red tape and removing planning restrictions ensuring that childminders and nurseries that are good or outstanding can automatically receive government funding for 2-, 3- and 4-year-olds supporting parents to access more informal care We want to encourage more schools to follow the examples of trailblazers like Harris Academies and the Free School Norwich by offering parents childcare before and after school and during holiday times, working with private and voluntary providers if they want to do so. Today Harris Academies has committed that every new Harris primary academy that opens will offer a wrap around care service from 8am to 6pm as a minimum for the children that attend. The Free School Norwich offers childcare for parents before and after school and for 51 weeks a year, all on a self-funding basis. The government wants to make it easier for nurseries and childminders to expand by extending the planning relaxations recently introduced for state-funded schools to nurseries, such as using vacant office space. All good and outstanding childminders and nurseries will automatically be eligible to receive government early education funding from September. At the moment local authorities act as gatekeepers to this funding. This change will mean that over 80% of nurseries and over 70% of childminders would be able to receive this funding. Less than 10% of childminders currently offer funded places. This reform will help create a fairer market for childminders, which alongside the introduction of childminder agencies should see increased choice for parents who want high quality home-based care. This change will free up local authorities to work in concert with Ofsted to improve weaker providers and attract new strong providers to their areas. We will also seek to address historic unfairnesses in funding by looking to introduce a national funding formula for early education in time. In addition, we are proposing to streamline regulations, so that: schools have flexibility to provide childcare beyond term times and beyond the school day, making it easier for schools to offer provision from 8am to 6pm for 3- and 4-year-olds and primary school children, in addition to enabling school nurseries to accept 2-year-olds we will remove the unnecessary after-school learning requirements for children of reception age, who are already being taught during the school day there will be a single set of safety requirements for all children, with separate learning requirements for those not at school, in place of the 3 separate sets of requirements that currently apply nurseries and childminders do not need to complete paperwork such as ‘learning journeys’, meaning more time with children we will support parents to make common sense arrangements with their friends and neighbours by increasing the amount of time that a child can be looked after informally from 2 to 3 hours per day. Copies of the report and consultation documents will be in House libraries."
/government/news/ofsted-calls-for-swift-improvement-in-pre-schools-and-nurseries,"From 4 November 2013, a judgement of ‘requires improvement’ will replace the current ‘satisfactory’ judgement for all early years providers – as it has already for schools and colleges. Publishing the outcomes of the Good early years provision for all consultation, which sets out Ofsted’s proposals for early years providers, Sir Michael Wilshaw, Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector, announced that ‘good’ will be the minimum standard expected. From November, pre-schools and nurseries requiring improvement will have a maximum of two years to get to ‘good’ - otherwise they face the prospect of being judged ‘inadequate’. Sir Michael Wilshaw said: The early years are crucial. That’s why only a good standard of education and care is acceptable for our youngest children. Pre-schools and nurseries need to give children a solid foundation. Two years is a long time in a child’s life and it’s long enough for a setting to improve. I agree with the parents who told us in our consultation that four years is too long to wait for a nursery to reach the good standard that every child deserves. As a nation, we spend around £5 billion a year on funded early education but too many pre-schools and nurseries across the country are not yet good, particularly in the most deprived areas. That’s why Ofsted is determined to introduce greater challenge into the early years sector. Early years provision is only as good as the quality of interaction between adults and children. The best providers understand the importance of teaching children through their play while also giving them structures and routines which bring order and security into their lives. It is vital that very young children make good progress so that they succeed in later years. I am clear that we ignore early education and care at our peril. As a result of comments from the consultation, changes to the new inspection framework will include the following. For all early years providers: the satisfactory judgement will be replaced by ‘requires improvement’ ‘inadequate’ settings are likely to be re-inspected after 6 months if an ‘inadequate’ setting fails to improve sufficiently and is found ‘inadequate’ again after re-inspection, Ofsted may take steps to cancel that setting’s registration For pre-schools and nurseries: there will be re-inspection within a year for those which ‘require improvement’ with the expectation that the setting will get to ‘good’ within two years those that fail to improve after two years are likely to be judged ‘inadequate’ Ofsted will take into account the potential impact of an inadequate decision on a case by case basis when the first non-domestic providers judged to ‘require improvement’ approach the end of the 24 month period. Any decisions made will be taken in the best interests of the children and parents using the services inspected. The formal consultation Good early years provision for all ran between April and May. Ofsted consulted on five key questions and received more than 2,500 responses from professionals, parents and carers. Their comments underpin these new inspection arrangements. The changes are intended to strengthen the impact of Ofsted’s inspection and improvement activity through more frequent monitoring of early years provision in settings which are not yet good. The new inspection framework will be published in full in September with the first inspections under the new system beginning in November. Notes to editors The Good early years provision for all consultation outcome report is available on GOV.UK. Please note: the consultation did not include childminders as the government is considering new initiatives in this area, including the proposal for childminder agencies to be established. Good early years provision for all consulted on a proposed time of four years for non-domestic settings, such as nurseries, that require improvement to get to ‘good’. Comments made by respondents in the consultation said that four years is too long. [Contact:2325]"

/government/speeches/elizabeth-truss-speaks-about-curriculum-reform,"Thank you. It’s a pleasure to be here today. Of course I face stiff competition today, with the Deputy Prime Minister speaking in Glasgow. I spent my early years in Paisley, a few miles away. It boomed in the 19th century - with mills and factories and, of course, Paisley pattern. The 1980s, when I lived there, were harder. It faced industrial decline. My dad was a lecturer at Paisley College of Technology - now a university - and started to teach computing, which at that time, was quite a new technology. In other words Paisley made the same transition as the UK - from industrial power, to relative decline, to adaptation. The next industrial revolution? What’s fascinating is that we might see similar upheaval again. Deindustrialisation was led by globalisation and technology: today, we face rapid shifts in global economic power and a new digital economy. If any of you saw Newsnight just the other week, the technologist Rohan Silva was talking about an ‘hour-glass’ shaped economy. In this emerging model there is wealth for the highly-skilled, who can harness new technologies. At the other end of the scale, there are lots of low-paid, low-qualifications jobs - local, manual labour which cannot be easily automated or outsourced. But in the middle, white-collar, middle-class jobs are now threatened by high-powered computers and highly-educated graduates across the world. This is an era of unprecedented competition. Compete or fall behind And it leaves us with a question. How do we respond? In an era where human capital is more important than physical capital, it means we need to improve education. The evidence is quite clear here: countries with higher attainment have higher growth rates. And the association between test scores and growth rates increased by a third between 1960 and 2000. This should worry us. PISA - the OECD international student assessment - ranks us only 25th in reading, 27th in maths and 16th in science. If we develop a world-class education system - but only if we develop a world-class education system - we have a chance to become one of the high-skilled, highly-educated societies that takes advantage of the new order. Nowhere is this clearer than in maths, science and engineering. Maths, for example, is the only school subject which has been proven to add to earnings, by up to 10% at A level, even when every other factor is taken into account. Pupils who are ahead of their peers in maths at age 10 tend to be earning 7% more at the age of 30. Those working in science or technological careers are paid, on average, 19% more than other professions. The earnings return for a level 3 apprenticeship in engineering or manufacturing is double that of arts, media or business administration apprenticeships. This is great for those individuals - but the real importance of these numbers is what they tell us about the UK economy. Higher wages are a sign of employer need - of the relatively high value and productivity of STEM -educated staff. They suggest that excellent STEM education is of essential economic importance - a level of demand that we can’t afford to ignore. The German example - PISA shock Other countries understood this much earlier than we have. Take Germany: for many years, it prided itself on the quality of its education system. Until, that is, the 2000 PISA assessments. This showed that far from leading the world, German pupils were well below average in literacy, and the system particularly let down disadvantaged students. It prompted introspection. There were newspaper headlines, national debates - there was even a quiz show on TV where people could try to answer the questions in the assessments. So they changed. There was more focus on early years. There was a commitment to improving teacher quality. Transparent standards and consistent student assessments were introduced. Critically, they increased flexibility for young people to combine academic and employer environments. So even those who choose an apprenticeship after the age of 15, carry on with maths and carry on with core subjects at school until the age of 18. One of the big myths about Germany is the supposed purity of its vocational education. They have, in fact, been moving in the opposite direction - and it shows that deciding between vocational or academic education is a false choice. The result of these decade-long reforms was impressive. In 2000, Germany was behind England. By 2009, they’d overtaken us. The ‘ PISA schock’, as it become known, shows what can be done when there is focused education reform. Now compare England to Germany. We’ve already seen our PISA ranking is unnervingly low. TIMMS - an international benchmarking of maths and science teaching - shows we have stagnated in maths, and for 10-year-olds, our science scores have dropped. In Japan, 85% take advanced maths, equivalent to at least AS level, in upper secondary. In Taiwan, the figure is 70%. In England, it’s 13%. A rounded curriculum This is why we are changing the system - starting with curriculum reform. We’re learning from Germany here. Whatever pupils want to do after school, and whether vocational or technical training is right for them, a solid academic core helps them get there. This isn’t to say that educating the whole child isn’t important. Our guidance recognises the core body of knowledge that children should learn - and our EBacc prioritises the subjects employers value. But we do not dictate how to teach. And this gives teachers space to develop wider skills. Michael Wilshaw, now head of Ofsted , epitomised a ‘whole child’ approach when he was head of Mossbourne Academy. The school looked at improving attainment in a wider context of improved behaviour and social interaction. He has taken that philosophy and approach into inspection. And it guides our curriculum too. Good schools are taking advantage, providing activities like debating, public speaking, negotiation - a school in my constituency is offering business mentoring, for example. I know that employers value abilities and personal characteristics like resilience, problem-solving, good character. By getting away from a tick-box system, teachers have greater flexibility to combine academic excellence with developing these wider skills. Maths So what are we actually doing in each subject? I want to start with maths - the most important for our future. At primary, we’re encouraging children to become fluent in their times tables at a younger age, removing calculators from primary tests - and introducing a new curriculum giving children a stronger foundation in the vital elements of maths, like arithmetic and fractions. Our schools spend less time teaching maths than most countries - TIMSS 2011 ranked us 39 of 42 for maths teaching time at age 14. In the subject where we are behind, we are doing less. So improving secondary maths is a top priority. We’re making GCSEs more challenging and rigorous, with pupils covering more content and more non-routine problems which expect students to apply themselves in different ways - in areas like ratios, proportions, interest-rates. And we’re transforming post-16 maths. Pupils who haven’t yet achieved a C at GCSE will keep studying. Those who got a good GCSE , but don’t want to pursue an A level, will do a range of new mid-level qualifications, specifically aimed at those students who do not want to do a whole A Level. And those going on to A level will be stretched by more challenging qualifications. By 2020, the vast majority of young people will be studying maths right up to 18 - every one of them achieving the highest standard they possibly can. Sciences We’re being equally ambitious in the sciences. GCSE and A level content will be deeper. And as more and more scientific disciplines require maths, we’re increasing the maths component of the sciences. In biology, for example, pupils will be better prepared for biomechanics or genetics - opening up more options to our young people. And thanks to our curriculum reforms, we’ve started to see real progress in the numbers of students taking sciences. This year, the number of girls doing chemistry or physics at GCSE hit record levels - catching up with the boys. Looking at the numbers over the previous decade, we have seen a massive improvement. The number of physics A levels has gone up 29%; chemistry by 28%; biology by 20%. (between 2007 and 2012). So we have seen a big move towards STEM subjects. DT and computing We’re also making sure students can apply this knowledge, too. Our new design and technology courses focus on the practical application of science. It will expose students to the most exciting and transformative technologies - 3D printing, robotics, biomimicry, computer-aided design. And computer skills are being brought in earlier, too. Coding - one of the essential skills of the 21st century - will now start at age 5. We are aiming to develop one of the most rigorous computing curricula in the world, where pupils will learn to handle detailed, abstract computing processes and over-11s will learn 2 programming languages. I remember being at school and using early computers. Yes, I was in computer club - and I loved it. I think we’ve lost some of that sense of joy and excitement in computing, and have just become focused on just training kids to use Windows. We want to bring some of that excitement back. English I know one of your top concerns is English, and basic literacy. So children will now sit a new spelling, punctuation and grammar test when they leave primary school. And we’ve introduced a compulsory phonics check in year 1, that is already helping spot children who have fallen behind in reading - in last year’s check around 235,000 children were identified as needing extra help. And at GCSE and A level, we are being much more firm about sloppy mistakes and poor grammar - keeping standards high into secondary school. People say that technology has transformed the world. But it’s actually made writing more important - so much of the new technology requires written communication. I think it’s right schools focus on getting the basics right. Languages We have also made extensive changes to language teaching. Languages had been in long decline - but our new EBacc has started to reverse the trend. In 2012 the number of GCSE entries in languages was its highest in 5 years. The number of French entries was up 16%, German entries up 9%, and Spanish entries up 26%. And from next year, primary schools will also be required to teach a foreign language at age 7. This prompted some real interest - we’ve seen a great campaign from the Japan Foundation, for example, encouraging primary schools to adopt Japanese. They plan to help schools provide the subject, developing materials and encouraging take-up of the language. It is exactly the sort of thing we want to encourage - curriculum reform inspiring innovation in schools. A challenge to employers And I want to challenge you to follow this example. We are rebalancing the curriculum towards high-value subjects - in maths, the sciences, DT , computing, English and the languages. We have unblocked the pipeline of future engineers, mathematicians, linguists - and in time, you will feel the benefit. But think about what you could do too - in 3 specific areas. First, we’re extending core maths to age 18. Your endorsement of the new qualifications would be incredibly helpful. It’s launching in October. You could follow universities’ lead - and make it clear that STEM subjects are highly valuable even if you don’t want to go into STEM industries. The historians or English literature graduates of today are tomorrow’s primary school teachers, journalists, politicians. We need to break out of a cycle where successive generations lack strong maths skills. Second, we’ve seen record numbers of girls entering the sciences at GCSE . But it’s still fewer than boys. So what could you do - how could the voice of business persuade young women engineering isn’t just a job for the boys? How do you persuade girls there are careers in science, and translate that GCSE uptake into A level? Third, how can you support languages? What about following the example of the Japan Foundation - what about employers talking directly to schools? Getting involved in developing young people? You are an influential voice with parents, pupils and schools. Broadcasting loud and clear to them what employers want and value - and promoting these important subjects - would be hugely valued. We face a rapidly changing, newly competitive world. Improving education - especially maths and science - is essential if we are to compete. We are approaching the task with a sense of ambition and energy. And I urge employers to join us. Thank you."
/government/news/new-2-million-scheme-for-early-years-apprentices,"Those aspiring to a career in early education will be able to apply for a bursary worth up to £1,500, with a further £300 available for more training, from September. There will be up to 1,000 bursary places available. In January, in ‘More great childcare’ , the government said it would build a stronger and more professional early years workforce with more rigorous qualifications. The apprenticeship bursary will be a transitional scheme ahead of the early years educator qualifications in 2014. The apprenticeship bursary scheme will also seek to support the delivery of the early learning places for 2-year-olds. To be eligible, applicants will need to secure an apprenticeship position in a nursery or other provision that delivers the early learning places for 2-year-olds and hold at least a GCSE, at grade C or above, in English and maths, to help ensure that a more skilled workforce delivers better quality early education. Elizabeth Truss, Childcare and Education Minister, said: Caring for and educating young children is a fantastically rewarding job. The bursaries announced today will make it easier for talented people to start a career in early education. Providing good quality early education is proven to help young children get a head start in life, especially those who are from poorer backgrounds. I hope these bursaries encourage students to consider working in early education. The scheme, which will be run by the National College for Teaching and Leadership, will be open to applications from this September. Apprenticeships are expected to last an average of 20 months. They will consist of employment and study to gain a recognised qualification through various routes, including further education colleges. David Pomfret, Principal of the College of West Anglia, said: We have seen a significant increase in the number of young people taking childcare courses at the college in recent years and are about to launch a new range of work-based apprenticeships in early years to provide further opportunities. We welcome the minister’s announcement of the apprenticeship bursary scheme, which should enable more people to train for a career in this growth industry. Notes to editors There is clear evidence that it is quality childcare that makes a positive difference to a young child’s life chances. For example, Andreas Schleicher of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said: Results from PISA show that high performing education systems consistently prioritise the quality of their staff over the size of classes. OECD’s work on early childhood education ‘Starting strong 3’ underlines the importance of having staff with proper educational qualifications and that staff qualifications are the best predictor of the quality of early childhood education and care. The main bursary payment will be subject to tax and national insurance deductions. Since September 2010 every 3- and 4-year-old has been entitled to 15 hours per week of funded early education. From September 2013 the government will introduce early learning places for around 20% of all 2-year-olds. Children will be eligible if their families meet the income and benefits criteria also used for free school meals, or if they are looked after by their local authority. From September 2014, this will be increased to around 40% of 2-year-olds. The government recently consulted on eligibility criteria for new early years qualifications, which will be available from 2014. We will publish the findings and new criteria soon. The scheme will be administered by the National College for Teaching and Leadership and details will be published on its website shortly. More information can be obtained by emailing the NCTL apprenticeships team . Applicants will need to be undertaking the level 3 advanced apprenticeship in children and young people’s workforce to be eligible. [Contact:997]"
/government/speeches/transforming-the-early-years-workforce,"Transforming the early years workforce: Leadership and improvement aspirations for the early years workforce of the future, the journey to get there and how to make early years a career of choice. Thank you very much for inviting me here today. Last year I was due to speak at this conference but I was unfortunately in hospital so I am very pleased to fulfil my commitment to Purnima despite being a year late. The first speech I made about our role at the National College for Teaching and Leadership, in supporting nurseries and day-care was at a NDNA event last September. It is great to be back to talk about the progress that has been made since then. May I briefly pay tribute to the outstanding leadership of NDNA provided by Purnima. You travel the length and breadth of the country talking to providers, lobbying politicians and appearing in the media in order that the voice of the early years sector is heard loudly and clearly across the country. And you do it with great charm, patience and the utter determination that seems to be a hall mark of people who work in the early years. We at NCTL look forward to continuing to work with Purnima and NDNA to achieve our shared vision of a dynamic childcare market, delivering high quality early education all over the country, for all types of families. Events put on by NDNA provide opportunities for colleagues to meet, network and share ideas and they are essential in order that we keep the momentum up in this dynamic and fast-changing world. For 6 years I was the head of the Willows Special School in Hillingdon including First Steps, our nursery, which supported some of the most troubled children and families in West London. I was enormously proud of our nursery, that did a staggering job under the leadership of the remarkable Helen Rees, one of the most dedicated, hard-working and brilliant teachers I have ever worked with. Helen has that restless search for improvement, the sense that however good things are they can always get better, and an absolute commitment to the children in her care. It is people like Helen, people like you, the experts, who should take the lead in the development of a self-improving, professional-led 0 to 18 system. Today I want to talk to you about how I believe early years providers and schools can work together to create a world class education system. I also want to talk about how we can make the early years a career of choice. My aim is for NCTL is to support the development of an education system that is led by the best schools, early years providers, leaders and professionals working together for the benefit of all our children. The great privilege of this job as Chief Executive of the National College is the opportunity I have to visit nurseries and schools and hear from remarkable leaders across the country. Yesterday I visited Everton Nursery School and Family Centre, that leads the North Liverpool Teaching School Partnership led by the remarkable head teacher Dr Lesley Curtis. At their Ofsted inspection in May 2014 the nursery was rated outstanding in all categories. The report puts the success of the school quite simply: “Children make an exceptional start to their school life because teaching is outstanding”. But Everton is much more than an outstanding school and family centre. It is, I believe, a template for education in England in the future. In March 2013 Everton was granted Teaching School status along with its four partner primary schools, and since then it is quite remarkable what has been achieved. It is a brilliant example of the impact early years leaders can have locally. It is offering a wide range of support including: Initial teacher training through School Direct School improvement through school-to-school support Research and development Continuous professional development and leadership This year Everton has taken the opportunity to be one of the first to deliver School Direct (Early Years) with 15 places specifically for early years teachers. They are also working on research programmes with the University of Cumbria. On top of that they successfully deploy national and specialist leaders of education to support other nursery schools and schools in the EYFS. With this support, one particular school moved from special measures to good. Everton is breaking down the artificial boundaries that still continue between nurseries and mainstream schools. And constantly challenging the perception, that, I’m sorry to say, still exists, that says schools can’t learn anything from the early years. Everton is also the national coordinator for 20 teaching schools alliances who are developing local hubs to bring together a range of early years providers jointly to develop and improve practice. Finally, they offer a range of high quality early years CPD courses. In particular they are focussing on the essential interaction between members of staff and children. How they ask questions, how can they get their children talking, listening and responding, and how improving the quality of staff is the most important way to improve outcomes for children. The focus on speaking and listening is a central component of the school where so many children, in this deprived area of Liverpool, come in with significant difficulties with language. Now I understand that not all nurseries will have the capacity of Everton, but many of you have a huge amount of expertise to share, and any nursery from the private and voluntary sector and the maintained sector, can become involved in a teaching school alliance. And I would urge you to consider this as a way of sharing your expertise and receiving support from a wider network of colleagues. At the Nursery Awards tonight you will see many examples of excellent practice being recognised from across the country. The role of NCTL is not to tell you how to run a professional-led system, there is no way that the government can know what is needed or what must be done in different parts of the country. But we will continue to offer the support to help you to take more control and responsibility of the system and develop your workforce to become even better. It is important for NCTL and for ministers to continue to understand the context and circumstances in which early years providers and schools work. I understand that things probably don’t feel easy at the moment. To some extent they never have, and workers in the early years and schools are well accustomed to responding quickly and professionally to changes of government expectations, of funding, of inspection, of everything really. But I know this probably feels particularly tricky given the challenging situation with public funding. I know that local authority services are much smaller than they once were. And government expectations are changing – with factors such as the removal of the role of the local authority in early years, quality assessment, and changes in the Ofsted inspection regime. I am sure also that many of you will be working hard in challenging timescales to deliver the new early education entitlement for disadvantaged 2-year-olds. But one thing stays the same - children and parents need high quality early education and care. That is an ambition shared by us all. So how will a professional-led system help you? It will mean that that the people who are the experts, doing the work on the ground, day after day, are the ones deciding on the content and focus of continuous professional development. They will be seeking out, recruiting and training the next generation of leaders and teachers to further professionalise and improve our schools and early years provision. Locally run CPD programmes are a great example of how schools and early years providers are already leading the system. They are designed to give leaders what they require and ask for, in order to fulfil their roles, and continue to improve their settings. I know that some of you in the room may already have adopted a self-improving approach in developing programmes to enable your best leaders and practitioners to support others to improve. Nottinghamshire and Northampton are two excellent examples of this, offering peer mentoring schemes across their early years settings. The CPD programmes at the NDNA such as the maths champions are another great example. Graduate early years professionals have been recruited as local maths champions to support other staff in developing both their own skills, and the maths skills of the children they work with. These maths champions have worked hard to gain the confidence of nursery staff needing support. The project has developed resources as well as signposting staff to further education colleges providing GCSE maths. The project has proved to be very popular and the confidence levels in maths, of the practitioners involved, have increased. This project is now in its second year. And now English champions will also be introduced, building on the success of the maths champions and using a similar format. These are the sector’s programmes - not what the government think is needed – and they’re already proving a huge success. There has been quite a lot of thinking on how schools can be self-improving, holding one another to account and offering support. We now want to extend this into the early years. However, I recognise this is a different context, not least because of the major role played by the PVI sector. This is one of the reasons I am here today and want to hear from you – as leaders– about how we can make this work. And make it work we must, if we are to make all provision outstanding for all children. At the moment there is an 18 month vocabulary gap between children from low income and high income families when they arrive at school. Many children enter formal schooling already behind and we must close this gap. Schools working alongside private and voluntary nurseries can help to change this. We know that high-quality provision is particularly important for the most disadvantaged children. So how can we make a self-improving, birth to 18 professional-led system a reality? First by helping leaders and providers to make the most of the reforms to improve the quality of their staff in the early years. Ninety per cent of the success of any organisation is the quality of its workforce. The better the workforce, the better the outcomes for children. So at graduate level we have expanded Teach First in schools and introduced Teach First for the early years. This has brought even more of the brightest young graduates to work with our most disadvantaged children. There are already 16 top graduates on the programme and we recently announced an increase to 50 places for this July. But this is not just about the numbers, it is about raising the profile of the early years. And saying this is a career that can and should appeal to the brightest and the best. And we have built on the success of the early years professional programme to introduce the new status of early years teacher, equivalent to qualified teacher status, attracting even more high-quality graduates into a career in early education. We have developed a set of robust early years teachers’ standards to operate in parallel with the new Teachers’ Standards - identifying the essential elements that make good teachers for children from birth to 18. The quality of graduates entering ITT has never been higher. And from this year the entry requirements for early years teacher training will be strengthened even further with the introduction of the skills tests making it the same as for primary teacher training. Early years ITT will be delivered by accredited ITT providers who currently deliver QTS. This approach will locate early years teacher training with good and outstanding providers of ITT pushing up training quality even further. It is critical to continue to improve the quality of all staff in the early years workforce. So, now OFSTED will include the qualifications of staff in their judgements of early years settings. They will also look at how staff knowledge, qualifications, training and expertise impacts on their practice and children’s learning and development. We want more young children to have the support of an early years teacher. All the evidence suggests that graduate-led nurseries achieve the best outcomes for children. This is particularly important for children from disadvantaged backgrounds, as there is strong evidence to show they have the most to gain from good-quality early years provision. The recent research from the Nuffield Foundation (1) found that employing graduate teachers in PVI nurseries significantly raised quality in disadvantaged areas. I know many of you have been very supportive of employing early years teachers. Therefore our aim is to attract more graduates into early years teacher training. Recruitment to the early years teacher programme was strong last year and I am delighted that over 600 trainees have already completed their training and achieved early years teacher status, and many more are nearing completion. These join over 13,300 who have already achieved Early Years Professional Status. To support more employers to recruit and train an early years teacher we have introduced an employer incentive this year of £14,000 per trainee on the graduate employment based training route which can be used to support the £7,000 course fees, and a contribution to supply costs and salaries. Latest data (2) shows that around a third of non-local-authority-run, full day care settings employ at least one graduate with early years professional status, so there is still a long way to go before all young children have access to a graduate teacher. I would encourage all employers to take advantage of this increased training funding. School Direct was introduced to give schools more control over the training and development of their own workforce. The appetite for schools to become involved in initial teacher training through School Direct has been quite staggering. In the first year we had bids for 1,000 places, last year it was over 9,000 and this year schools asked us for 17,700 places including an increase in primary bids from 3,400 to 6,900. And now we want schools and nurseries to develop the next generation of early years teachers. We are extending School Direct to the early years for the first time – meaning that nurseries can have more involvement in the training of early years teachers. As a first stage, 59 School Direct (Early Years) places have been allocated for September 2014 to 6 early years teaching schools and the large nursery chain, Bright Horizons. This is a shared project across the maintained and the private sector. If it works out as well as we hope – and School Direct is already working very well in schools – next year will be bigger, and more schools and nurseries will be able to get involved. This is a fundamental part of the teacher-led, self-improving system – putting you in charge of developing the next generation of early years teachers. To improve qualifications at level 3 we have developed robust criteria for new early years educator qualifications. Work is progressing very well and NCTL and Ofqual have already approved the first seven qualifications submitted by awarding organisations. These I am delighted to say, are of a high standard and will be available for September 2014. To increase the literacy and numeracy skills of the future workforce all entrants to early years educator training courses from September 2014 will be expected to have a GCSE at grade C or above in English and maths. Parents trust nurseries to help their children learn to speak and to add up. A more skilled workforce will increase the quality of support for children particularly in developing communication, language, literacy, and mathematical skills. This will ensure that they are ready to learn and thrive at school. Those holding an early years qualification at level 3 can, under the EYFS, lead and manage nurseries, so it is especially important that they have good literacy and numeracy skills I know this change is challenging, and some of you are concerned that this may reduce the number of learners on level 3 courses, and therefore those entering the workforce at this level. However, many of you have told us that you support this development, as it will increase the quality and status of your workforce, and improve the support for children. Some of you indeed already require these GCSEs. The current workforce is not affected by this change, but there are opportunities to access funding to achieve English and maths GCSE, if current employees wish to do so. The government is committed to improving levels of literacy and numeracy. It has maintained entitlements to fully funded English and maths provision, that will support progression to the standard of a good GCSE for all adult learners. I hope you will continue to encourage your existing workforce to improve their skills. Projects, such as the maths and English Champions are ideal vehicles for this. There are many brilliant practitioners in early years who, with the right support, can progress in their career and we must encourage them to do so. Up until August 2014 we still have bursaries available to level 3 apprentices who have secured English and maths GCSEs at grade C or above. We all want to make early years a career of choice. The first 5 years of life are critical and young children deserve the best possible support. These reforms have the potential to transform the workforce by attracting the best quality graduates as early years teachers. And high calibre level 3 recruits with the new early years educator qualifications. Second , as well as helping you to improve the quality of your workforce, we want schools and early years providers to support improvement locally. For early years providers and schools to work more closely with each other as part of a self-improving birth to 18 system. Many early years providers will already have excellent relations with local schools making the transition to primary school a slick, well-organised process. But I would also bet that for some of you, transition is not as smooth as it should be, for such an important and challenging change. Communication is not clear and busy people cannot find time to meet and discuss more complex children. And I am afraid some schools simply do not understand the importance of transition and discount the essential work that is done in the early years. In a system led by early years providers and schools, we must break down and challenge the divides that still exist. In addition to observing and visiting, there is more that can be done if these walls come down. In the future, we should be seeking opportunities to share expertise, resources and knowledge to improve children’s learning and achievement. And I don’t just mean that schools should pass on their insight to early years providers, I mean both ways. The more schools and early years providers are able to collaborate and work together, the better the outcomes for children. I know that the NDNA is doing work through a grant from the DfE to broker partnerships between PVI providers and schools. For example, providing practical examples of working together on delivering 8-6 nursery offers for parents, or on the use of graduates to deliver high-quality childcare at affordable cost. Events over the autumn and winter, open to PVI and schools, practitioners, and managers, will be looking at innovative and effective local models for this sort of joint working and learning. With the reduction in some local authority services, early years providers and schools need to be looking elsewhere for support. I see this as a great opportunity to develop partnerships and put early years provision at the heart of local networks. A birth to 18 self-improving system will use the best leaders and the best professionals to support others. We want early years providers to embrace fully their role in children’s education and to play an important part in working with others towards achieving a world-class birth to 18 system. The expertise and experience that exists in the early years sector means they have so much to give to this approach. And for parents and children it is essential that the early years and schools are working together providing seamless, co-ordinated services, particularly for the most disadvantaged families. I would love to hear examples of where this practice is already well-established so that we can help to share more widely. This is ultimately about trusting the profession – giving professionals more responsibility for improving quality, and putting the profession at the heart of the system. This will contribute to greater motivation, better retention and higher standards across the workforce. We know from schools what a difference it makes for teacher motivation when they work beyond the boundaries of a single organisation on peer improvement. There are already almost 300 (291) early years specialist leaders of education supporting quality improvement. There is a growing number of early years teaching schools and alliances where early years providers are key strategic partners. These teaching schools and alliances are already developing opportunities for joint CPD and practice development. For example Bristol early years teaching consortium have designated early years specialist leaders of education who can offer support across the birth to 7 age range, including family support workers. Teaching schools are central to the delivery of the government’s vision for a self-improving school led system. They are some of the very best schools in the country. They are outstanding in their own performance and have a track record of working with others to raise standards for children beyond their own school. Maintained nursery schools are already engaged in this vision. Sixteen nursery schools are already designated as teaching schools and over 50 more are formally linked into teaching school alliances. Many of these already have strong links with their local PVI settings and child-minders. This number increases still further when we include schools with registered nursery provision to over 100 teaching schools and over 1,000 more formally linked into teaching. St Edmunds Nursery School and Children’s Centre, that leads the Bradford birth to 19 teaching school alliance, is a great examples of this, bringing together early years providers and schools through their alliance, to support, encourage and drive local improvements in quality. We want to strengthen this even further and encourage more early years engagement in a self-improving education system, so that improvements are driven locally by the best leaders. To support this we have commissioned 20 teaching schools, through the research and development network, to test and develop local early years hubs. They will engage a range of early years providers in professional dialogue, practice sharing and development. This will increase the transfer of knowledge across and between schools and early years providers. Some common research themes that have already emerged are: transitions, school readiness and effective practitioner networks – something I am sure early years providers can expertly contribute to. But we need to do more. The affordability and availability of childcare is a major barrier to work amongst parents of the under 5s. There is a strong demand for a greater number and range of nurseries providing childcare. And without suitable provision it is difficult for young families to be able to find good quality places for their children that are convenient for their journeys to work. The government wants to make it easier for nurseries and child minders to expand by extending the planning relaxations recently introduced for state-funded schools - such as using vacant office space - to nurseries. The government also wants to use our schools better and encourage more schools to offer nursery places for 2 year-olds as well as 3 and 4 year-olds. It has made it easier for every school to open a nursery for the whole day from 8am to 6pm, as the availability of childcare supports parents to balance childcare and work. Parents can choose the times they need flexibly. Schools offer a popular and convenient option for some parents, and schools’ facilities will be better used. We also want to see more great quality private and voluntary nurseries, as Liz Truss said recently: we want ‘a system that is better together’. We all want the norm to be high-quality opportunities for peer-to-peer learning and improvement and we know that much of the best learning is generated by the sector for the sector. In developing a self-improving birth to 18 system we need to break down the barriers preventing great practice and expertise from being shared and reciprocated. This will benefit all children entering and progressing through our education system. So we need to be listening to and learning from early years providers. What are the barriers stopping them leading improvement across settings within a birth to 18 system? How can we realise the benefits of such a system for all settings and the families they serve? What more can we do to support early years to become an integral element of it? It is important for all providers to think about collaboration rather than isolation or competition. To seek out opportunities to work in local partnerships with schools, to develop new approaches to supporting improvements in quality and school readiness. We want to see early years leaders play a full role in local partnerships to improve quality and to recruit, train and assess early years teachers. This is a real opportunity - building upon the great work you have already done, and continue to do, in improving children’s lives. If we continue to work together, we can make this vision a reality.

/government/speeches/edward-timpson-speaks-about-vulnerable-children-and-the-children-and-families-bill,"Edward Timpson speaking on reforms to support children and families Thanks, Anne Marie (Carrie, Barnado’s Chief Executive), for that warm welcome and for very kindly hosting this event and to Peter, from the Institute for Government, for kindly accommodating us. Thanks also to all of you, many of whom I have had the pleasure to work with, for finding time to join me here today. Almost 150 years after it was founded, Barnado’s continues to lead the way in standing up for the most vulnerable and voiceless children and young people in our society. Spurring us all to do much more to support them so that every child, whatever their background, has the chance to succeed. It’s an ambition and determination that this government very much shares and which is key to the publication, today, of the Children and Families Bill. And, it’s an ambition which, as many of you know, is particularly close to my heart. Growing up with many foster children and adopted siblings, I saw, first-hand, the huge challenges vulnerable children face, but also the huge scope for turning lives around. It wasn’t always easy. It can put a real strain on your own family and your relationships with each other. I remember coming home from school one day to find two boys I’d never seen before playing with my toys. Now, I’m sorry to say that my first reaction was to run upstairs, shut myself in my room and refuse to come out until they’d left. Many of the children who came into our home had been damaged by chaotic, difficult backgrounds. Their behaviour was, at times, incredibly challenging. I’ve seen babies addicted to heroin go into spasms. I’ve watched as an abused and deeply angry little boy shattered every pane of glass in my dad’s prized greenhouse because he didn’t know how else to let his anger out. And I became proficient in most swear words by the age of 10 thanks to the foster children who parroted back to me what they had heard at home. But, over time, as they gradually settled, I came to treasure seeing how love, stability and routine could help even the most troubled youngsters thrive and develop. It was this experience of caring for foster children and seeing how they could transcend disadvantage that gave me the impetus to train as a family barrister often representing children in care. It’s why, going into politics, I’ve made it my mission to improve the life chances of our most vulnerable children. And it’s why I’m proud to be introducing a Bill, with my coalition colleague Jo Swinson, that firmly puts the needs of these children at the heart of the government’s agenda. The Bill sets out our plans to: sweep away barriers to adoption speed up care proceedings in the family courts strengthen support for those with special educational needs. Families will also get extra support through a new system of shared parental leave, the right to request flexible working and improved childcare for working parents. And a theme running through the Bill is the enhancement of children’s rights. Of course, we all know that legislation alone isn’t enough. There’s also got to be a decisive shift in our attitudes to vulnerable children, especially those in care, if we’re to do better by them. Care can be the birth of hope and healing; the chance to trust in a better future. I’ve seen it and lived with it myself. But, too often, there continues to be a tendency to apply much lower standards and aspirations, whether it be safety, a suitable home environment or educational attainment, to looked-after children than would ever be thought acceptable for others. No ordinary parent would put up with their child moving home every 6 weeks, changing schools every term or going missing again and again. Yet, this is somehow regarded as sad, but inevitable for children in care. It’s a gulf in attitudes that seems to be based largely on defeatist assumptions that these children are too damaged or disadvantaged for us to expect much from them at all. Assumptions that see the care system as a bottom-of-the-pile, end-of-the-road option. And given this, it’s little wonder that, despite some encouraging progress in recent years, the prospects of looked after children continue to lag behind those of other children. The figures are dismally familiar. Only 15% of children in care get 5 good GCSEs, including English and maths, compared to nearly 60% of other children. Looked after children are 3 times more likely to end up unemployed. And they’re also 3 times more likely to suffer from a mental health condition than their peers. “Good enough” care for these children clearly isn’t good enough. Let’s be honest: Would we happy if this is where are our own children ended up? If the best they could hope for was to underachieve as a matter of course? Of course we wouldn’t. So why should we accept this for children in care? Especially when it’s been proved, time and time again, that these children can succeed, given the right care and support. In Essex, for example, the council is backing 1,700 new apprenticeships for vulnerable groups, a hundred of which are specifically reserved for looked after young people and care leavers. The council pays half of the young person’s wages, giving businesses no excuse not to take on bright, ambitious people who’ve been through the care system. It’s an approach that we’re supporting whole-heartedly through the From Care2Work programme, encouraging more businesses to provide them a route into work that may otherwise be beyond their reach. Far from giving up on vulnerable children, because they haven’t had the best start in life, we should be doubly determined to help them achieve all the things we would want for our own children - high aspirations in education and work, strong, stable relationships, good health and a positive involvement in their communities. I know that all we want to stop having to repeat those bleak statistics and begin to turn them, instead, into something that we can celebrate. To do this effectively, there’s got to be an unwavering focus on securing the best possible outcomes for vulnerable children in the shortest feasible time. I want everyone who’s involved in a vulnerable child’s life; teachers, social workers, foster carers, health professionals, councillors, to have a real sense of parental responsibility for their prospects. To, not just focus on their narrow area, but look at the child’s overall welfare. To ask themselves, before they make a decision or fill in a form, “Would this be good enough for my own child?” This is our best hope for challenging the end-of-the-road attitudes that have held children back and for genuinely putting their needs first - not just in principle, as has happened in the past, but, actually, in practice. So that the system fits in with what’s best for them and not the other way around. Top of the list of these needs is the need for stability, both during their time in the care system and when they’re leaving it. This is absolutely fundamental to their chances of overcoming damage and getting on in life. Children often cite stability, the laying down of roots, as the best thing about being in care - and moving around as the worst. Without it, they are left floundering. Yet, for too many of them, the care system heaps further uncertainty and upheaval onto children who have already had to contend with more than enough of this in their short lives. Too many find themselves on a conveyor belt of care. Being shunted from one placement to another. Being returned home too quickly to once again face the dangers that originally demanded their removal. Being forced to leave care at 16 - much earlier than most young people would be left to fend for themselves. There are cases of children with placements in the double figures. Almost a third of children in children’s homes have been through 5 or more placement breakdowns before moving into the home. I was told about a 16-year-old boy who was moved 31 times after being taken into care at the age of 3. One of his planned placements lasted less than 24 hours. But it’s not just a case of moving home. Children often have to move schools, adjust to new carers, new social workers, entirely new surroundings. To repeatedly see the plug pulled on everything that has become familiar. The fallout from being uprooted so often is profound. Evidence clearly shows that more placements equal worse outcomes. That the more times placements break down, the more rejected a child feels, seriously corroding their emotional resilience. Just under 40% of children who had one or two placements got 5 good GCSEs in 2010 compared to just 14.5% who had 3 or more placements. So it’s critical we do much more to reinforce stability. I want to see more local authorities learning from each other and improving their performance on placement stability. We’ll shortly be publishing a data pack that includes more detailed information on how often local authorities move children. We’ll also be putting in place more robust data collection to help local areas understand where they need to improve. On returns home from care, we’re aiming to support a number of local areas to develop and use interventions that work. We’re also planning to consult on changes to sharpen focus in this area and make it a bigger priority. A stable, supported transition to adulthood is also crucial for young people leaving care. We want to see more young people stay in care until their 18th birthday. This is something that the best local authorities are doing, giving care leavers the sort of support, as they become independent, that other young people take for granted. I very much applaud those that do and, with the participation age about to go up, call on other councils to follow suit. I regularly meet a group of care leavers to talk about how we can improve the support they receive. Their input was key to developing the Charter for Care Leavers and the Access all Areas report. Some, I believe, are in the audience today and I want to say how much I appreciate your continuing support and challenge. For my own part, I’ve been knocking on the doors of other government departments in Westminster and challenging them on the Access all Areas report and what they’re doing for care leavers. Because there’s, undeniably, a wider responsibility for their outcomes and there are many ways in which, right across government, we can do more to meet that obligation. One of the biggest barriers to stability is frankly inexcusable delay and drift in the care system. Delays that see thousands of children left in limbo in the adoption system and in the family courts. Delays which aren’t just frustrating or unfortunate, but which are denying children the stability that will lead to a better life. Because the one thing that children don’t have is time. A growing body of evidence on child development tells us that there’s a critical window during the early years; when everything that happens to a child has lifelong consequences for every area of their lives. From their ability to form secure attachments and control their emotions, especially when it comes to violence and aggression; to their vulnerability, later in life, to abuse such as child sexual exploitation and their chances of becoming perpetrators of abuse themselves. Early experiences of abuse and neglect cast a long shadow of a child’s future prospects at school, work and in their relationships. So every day of delay, in getting a vulnerable child the help they desperately need, damages their life chances. So given this, there can be little question as to why a child’s needs; to immediately be safe, to immediately have their basic needs met, must take priority over any other consideration - including the rights of biological parents who are unable or unwilling to reform their behaviour within the brief time-frame that’s so critical to a child’s development and when they’re at greatest risk of suffering serious harm. Over 60% of children coming into care do so because of abuse and neglect, so this compelling evidence should focus minds. Compared with 10, 20, 30 years ago, we have a much better understanding of what interventions work. Yet, it’s abundantly clear that timely intervention isn’t happening anywhere near enough. This was brought home to me all too painfully during my decade as a barrister in the care system. By the time a case landed on my desk, the damage had, all too often, already been done and it was a matter of trying to make the best of a bad job. It was apparent that cases were managed, all too often, for the convenience of adults rather than the interests of the child. This cannot continue. Reducing delays and promoting stability to meet the needs of vulnerable children has to be an absolute priority for everyone involved in their care. That’s why we’re legislating to make this happen. So, in future, there will be a 6-month time limit for the family courts to decide whether a child should be taken into care. The courts will also have to make sure decision-making and timetables take into account the child’s needs and the impact of delays on them. And, as the tri-borough project here in London demonstrates, this can be done. We’re also speeding up and simplifying the adoption system. Adoption offers vulnerable children one of the most stable foundations for a successful life. But the system is currently failing to deliver. Chronic delays mean that children in care wait an average of two years - in the worst cases, three years - to be adopted. There are currently just over 4,500 children with their lives on hold as they sit on adoption waiting lists. Yet, in some areas, prospective adopters are being ignored or turned away. Many are put off by intrusive and irrelevant checks. I recently heard about a couple who were asked what insurance company their car was registered with - what can that possibly have to do with their ability to adopt? I know from my own family experience of adoption - and the Secretary of State has also spoken eloquently about his - just how life-changing it can be, especially for those adopted at a young age. But, again, time is critical. Evidence shows that a child’s chances of adoption are reduced by almost 20% for every year they spend in care. Many in this room will know that I’m committed to doing whatever it takes to change this and bring vulnerable children and prospective parents together more quickly. We recently announced that we will be making £150 million available to councils to boost adoption rates. We’ve increased accountability by publishing data on how long it takes each local authority to place children for adoption, so we can drive up performance. And now we’re legislating to promote “fostering for adoption” placements, so people can foster the child they hope to adopt and build a bond earlier. The Bill will also end the undue emphasis on finding an ethnic match between the child and adoptive parents. A child’s background and individual characteristics are, of course, important, and we will maintain necessary checks and safeguards as already set out in the Children Act. But it’s not acceptable that it takes black children, on average, a year longer to find adoptive parents. Some councils are doing excellent work on adoption - Bristol, for example, has set and succeeded in hitting a target to increase adopter approvals by 50% - but performance, across the country, is too patchy. I’m keen to see rapid improvement and I truly hope we do. But if this doesn’t happen, we will intervene to make sure we have a system that meets the current and future demand for adopters and that works for children. Clearly, adoption isn’t right for every child. For 3/4 of children in care, fostering provides an equally valuable opportunity to enjoy some stability and enjoy normal family life. I regularly meet groups of children in care and quite a few have extolled the fantastic support foster carers provide. It’s why I wrote to foster carers a few months ago, letting them know how extremely grateful I am for all that they do. But, as with adoption, we need to recruit more foster carers, from a wider range of backgrounds, who can take on children with complex needs. People have said, in reference to my parents fostering, “You must be a very special person to do this.” I’m sure my parents won’t mind me saying this, but there are many people who could do what they have done. But fostering often isn’t seen as a viable option for modern, working families. We’re taking steps to change this; by making it easier for working people to undertake fostering. And by cutting the red-tape that stops foster carers from making every day parenting decisions about getting a child’s hair cut or letting them stay over with a friend. We’re also providing more support to existing foster carers. We’re enhancing the status and help available for long-term fostering; giving carers tailored support and a bigger say in how they look after the children to whom they’re committing. And making sure they face less bureaucracy. We’re also providing training for foster carers, especially when children with particularly challenging needs are involved. Schemes such as Multidimensional Treatment Foster Care, an intensive treatment programme delivered by the foster carers with the support of a skilled clinical team, have shown some really encouraging results. And we’re supporting local authorities and their partners to develop these specialist interventions so many children can benefit from this kind of help. Our aim is for more than half of local authorities to have embedded these and other specialist schemes for children in care and those on the edge of care into their core services by 2015. I believe we that have some specialist foster carers; Julie and Lauretta, with us today. I know from experience that taking on and sticking with children with such challenging needs can be incredibly demanding. I want to take this opportunity to say how thankful I am for your efforts. I’m sure the children you’ve helped will never forget what you’ve done for them. Some of the turnarounds that the scheme has achieved have been truly remarkable. In one case, the programme helped a 15-year-old boy, from a broken home plagued by violence, alcohol and drug use, to overcome a history of offending and school exclusions. Having been supported to re-enter education, he passed most of this exams - the first he’d ever achieved. He’s now attending college and has not re-offended for 2 years. It doesn’t surprise me that education played such a key role in transforming this boy’s prospects. Education is the engine of opportunity that offers all children the prospect of transcending the circumstances of their birth and the promise of a better life - and none more so than the most vulnerable. Yet, as I said earlier, there persists this glaring gap in educational achievement between children in care and their peers. There’s no doubt that looked after children can find it harder to achieve in education. But, with the right support, we’ve seen that children in care can and do achieve at school. Making this the norm, and not the exception, is every bit as important as finding them stable, loving homes. I want the education of looked after children to be a much higher priority. So that everyone involved in their care has the same high aspirations for them as they would their own children - and the same determination, as any other parent, to champion their needs. And I want children in care to be able to count on this support even if they move school. Which is why, under the Bill, we’ll be making it a requirement for every local authority to appoint an officer, often known as a virtual school head, to promote the educational achievement of the children it looks after, regardless of where they’re placed. We know, from Ofsted, that these educational champions can make a real difference, not only to a child’s progress, but also to the stability of their placements and their emotional wellbeing. In East Sussex, for example, a Virtual School Head has boosted results by working closely with and across primary, secondary and special schools; with the progress of children in secondary schools supported by one-to-one tuition, tailored resources, mentoring and revision courses. Ensuring that nobody gives up on them. This sort of extra support is vital for children in care, many of whom also have special educational needs - over two-thirds of looked after children have some form of SEN and around a third have a statement. Those with special educational needs tend to underachieve in education, in any case, so this double disadvantage bites hard. This makes it even more vital that the SEN system works well. Yet, we know that children with SEN face delays in getting help because their needs are often picked up late and, as with children in care, face poor prospects: around a third of all young people with SEN statements at 16 aren’t in education, employment or training at 18 compared to 13 per cent of their peers. So we’re taking action, through the Bill, to get services, across local authorities, health and social care, to join up and support for children with SEN. This support will extend from birth to 25 to support a successful transition to adulthood. It will also be much easier for children with SEN to find out what help is available through a new requirement on local authorities to publish a “Local Offer”. In making these changes, it’s important to stress that we’ll be maintaining and, in some cases, extending key protections and entitlements that matter to young people and their families. But, again, a change in the law can only do so much. Getting different services to work together in this way and put the child and their family in the driving seat demands, above all, cultural change. It can be a difficult road, but, as I’ve seen myself, pathfinders, across the country, are developing new systems with families at their heart, proving it can be done. But as important as it is to help vulnerable children find stability and drive up educational attainment, our first duty is to keep them safe. Emerging evidence about the horrors of child sexual exploitation has brought this into sharp focus. The Barnardo’s Cut Them Free campaign has done a great deal, not just to raise awareness of this despicable abuse, but also to propose solutions. I’m extremely thankful to you, and others here today, for working with us to tackle this issue. This work has involved contributions to our national action plan and to a roundtable meeting which I chaired in December, involving other Government Ministers and a range of organisations. The good news is that more perpetrators are being prosecuted and locked away for years. But we know there’s a lot more to do to combat these terrible crimes. We know, for example, that children who go missing from care are at serious risk of being exploited and harmed. Reports issued last year by the Joint All Party Parliamentary Group Inquiry and the Office of the Children’s Commissioner illustrated this only too starkly. So, if we’re to get to grips with this abuse, it’s clear we must have robust data on children who go missing to work with. The Working Group we set up last year to look at this has now reported and I can announce today that we will begin piloting a new data collection in the next few months. This will, for the first time, collect information on all children who go missing from their placement - not just those missing for 24 hours - enabling better analysis and more effective practice to prevent and combat the problem. In addition, we will shortly issue revised statutory guidance on Children who go Missing from Home or Care based on the best local practice. This will complement guidance issued to police forces by the Association of Chief Police Officers. Ofsted’s new looked after children inspections and the new multi-agency inspections, which will begin in June, will also shine a powerful light on progress being made on the ground. Sexual predators also exploit weaknesses in the residential care system, particularly an “out of sight out of mind” culture, which has seen too many children being placed in children’s home many miles from family and friends. In March 2011, children’s homes in 15 local authorities were entirely occupied by children from other local authorities. At the same time, 13 other local authorities, which had children’s homes in their area, made no placements in these homes; instead preferring to send their children to homes in other areas. Good children’s homes provide young people, for whom other placements aren’t suitable, with just the intensive, caring professional help and stability they need. But we know that there are some homes where support for children and security are poor. Which are located in parts of the country with meagre facilities and, worse still, where there are disproportionately large numbers of sex offenders often synonymous with organised criminal activity. Damaged children are particularly vulnerable to these dangers and we’re determined to do much more to protect them. We’re already on track to make it possible for Ofsted to share information on the location of children’s homes with the police and we will be urgently consulting on a number of further changes: That require local authorities, at a senior level, to take more responsibility for out of area placements that are a significant distance away. That ensure there’s rigorous independent scrutiny of the quality of care in each home. That clarify the roles and responsibilities of the placing authority, the children’s home and the area where the home is located, so there’s a real, shared responsibility for safeguarding the child and promoting their welfare. We’re also proposing to reform the qualifications framework to address the low level of qualifications among staff in children’s homes. And, by this summer, we’ll publish a revised data pack on residential care which will include more detailed information about children’s homes by local authority and region. This should go some way towards helping local authorities make much better choices. In all of this, we will continue to work key partners to find the best way forward. There can be no greater responsibility, for those entrusted with the care of vulnerable children, than to keep them safe. I can promise that I won’t hesitate to hold those who are failing to do so to account. I’m in no doubt that vulnerable children represent one of the sternest tests of our society. Doing what it takes to help them; undertaking reform and challenging and changing cultural assumptions and work practices, clearly isn’t easy. But it’s a test I’ve seen carers and professionals, across the country, meeting with love and dedication every day. Carers and professionals who are intervening decisively and providing the stability that we know offers vulnerable children the best chance to succeed - that offers them the chance to recover and secure good outcomes in the shortest time. I’ve seen for myself, at home and at work, the incredible difference that love and stability, particularly in a family setting, can make to overturning disadvantage. It’s why I want to see more adopters and more specialist foster carers recruited and why I want to see better residential care homes. Far too many vulnerable children, who have already missed out on so much in life, are missing out on this love and stability for no good reason - the damage and disadvantage they’ve suffered compounded by a system that’s supposed to be there to rescue them. Again, I ask, how would we feel if these were our own children? We’d almost certainly be outraged. Spurred into immediate action. So what’s the difference with the children in the care system? The truth is that there is no difference. They are our children. What happens to them, happens to us. If they do well at school, find work, form healthy relationships; we all benefit. Equally, if they end up in prison, suffer poor health and are unemployed, we all suffer. So, there’s a clear imperative, moral and hard-headed, for changing the game when it comes to the support we give them. To reduce delays, make well-informed, child-focused decisions and provide the love and stability they need and crave as quickly as possible. To give them the chance to have the kind of childhood and springboard to a better life that we would wish for own children. To not just say we’re going to put the needs of vulnerable children first, but actually do it. Thank you. Podcast: Edward Timpson talks about major reforms to support children and families"

If you’re interested in applying for early years ITT , visit the Get into Teaching website , or contact one of our early years accredited ITT providers . Providing children with good quality education and care in their earliest years can help them succeed at school and later in life. Early years teachers are specialists in early childhood development, trained to deliver the early years foundation stage for children from birth to five. To become an early years teacher a trainee has to complete an early years ITT course. This training provides opportunities to gain practical skills and underpinning theoretical knowledge to demonstrate the Teachers’ Standards (Early Years) . Successful completion of the training leads to the award of early years teacher status. Funding and training Funding is available to train graduates already employed in an early years setting. Training providers receive the funding and retain the course fee. The remaining funding is given to you to cover some of your costs in supporting the trainee employed by you to complete their course. For instance, supply costs or salary enhancement. Read the early years initial teacher training funding guide and the routes into early years ITT for further information. How your employee can apply If you have a graduate employed in your early years setting, encourage them to apply. They can apply directly to an early years ITT provider offering the graduate employment based route for September 2016. Research The following research reports show that the quality of provision is higher when early years practice is led by specially trained graduates: Evaluation of the graduate leader fund: final report . This research found settings which gained a graduate leader with early years professional status (the predecessor of early years teacher status) made significant improvements in quality for preschool children (aged 30 months to 5 years) as compared with settings which did not. Improvements were most evident where those with early years professional status worked directly in a room with children and led the practice. Longitudinal Study of Early Years Professional Status: an exploration of progress, leadership and impact final report . This research found that early years professional status had created professionals who are confident about taking on a leadership role in settings. Eighty per cent of early years professionals felt that gaining early years professional status had increased their ability to carry out improvements in their settings.

/government/news/press-briefing-morning-6-june-2013,"Barroso meeting Asked about the PM’s meeting with President Barroso, the PMS said that they would discuss issues facing the EU and the EU/US trade negotiations. The PM was driving at getting negotiations on the trade deal up and running, work was ongoing but he wanted an ambitious agreement. It was possible that discussions could also cover Syria, as the EU had recently taken a decision on the arms embargo. Syria Questioned on the current situation in Syria, the PMS said that no decision had been taken on arming the Syrian opposition. The government very strongly believed that the objective needed to be an end to the violence and suffering in Syria through political transition. As part of that, the international community needed to put pressure on the Assad regime and support the Syrian opposition, which the government had been doing by providing non-lethal assistance. The point of lifting the arms embargo was to provide the international community with flexibility on options further down the line. Childcare Asked about the government’s proposals for childcare, the PMS said that there had been a consultation and the government would set out the final package of measures shortly. The package would be designed to increase the accessibility to high quality childcare but take full account of the responses to the consultation. Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC) report Questioned on the Intelligence and Security Committee report on telecommunications and security, the PMS said that the government would respond fully in due course, and made the point that government had put in place robust measures."
/government/speeches/michael-gove-speaks-to-the-london-early-years-foundation-about-the-importance-of-early-years,"Thank you for your incredibly warm welcome. As I think you’ll be aware, it’s half term. My wife and our two children are in France, and I had the opportunity to join them for a few days at the beginning of the week. Originally I could have taken the whole week off, but I said no, I’m going to be here for June [O’Sullivan] on Friday. So I knew that it was going to be slightly less than a week. And then there was a vote in the House of Commons on Monday - I can’t remember what it was about and I suspect most of the public don’t either - and we all had to be there. So that meant I couldn’t leave until Tuesday morning. In the end, the only time that I had with my children was from Tuesday afternoon until yesterday. Just a couple of days, but they were hugely enjoyable. One of the things my children are planning to do today is visit a fantastic place in the South West of France where there are some marvellous examples of prehistoric cave art. You’ll probably be familiar with those caves in the Dordogne, full of amazing drawings generated by our ancestors thousands of years ago. Recently, academics have been looking more closely at that cave art, and they’ve discovered something really striking: they’ve discovered that many of those pictures were drawn by children. They’ve looked at the scale, the size, the way the indentations have been made on the side of the cave, and they’ve realised that only children could have done those drawings. But they’ve also noticed that some of these drawings are so high up that children must have been held by their parents, or by other adults, in order to make them. And they’ve observed an intricacy that suggest children’s hands being guided by adults’. More than that, there is actually one section in the cave that is a children’s zone, as it were; where most of the drawings, so the prehistoric experts tell us, were done by children. Now from that fascinating discovery, I take a number of lessons about how humans operated tens of thousands of years ago. The first is that the existence of a zone where young people are allowed to play and to explore - and where adults are there to watch over them and to help - suggests that children’s centres weren’t just invented ten years ago; they were invented tens of thousands of years ago. So all of you here are representatives of probably mankind’s oldest and most valued profession. The other thing that I learned from those cave drawings is that we’ve always had an understanding of the special role that childhood should play; and we’ve always had an appreciation of the importance of adults being there to foster child development. This appreciation was instinctive, and it was present tens of thousands of years ago. But it’s a lesson we’ve had to relearn in the course of the last century. In the last hundred or so years, we rediscovered the importance of childhood and the early years in particular, after a period where we tended to treat children as mini-adults, or as chattels, or as processions. Just over 150 years ago, child labour was a reality that politicians had to fight hard to contain. Children were seen as mini-adults who could be put into work - worse, mini-adults without rights, mere economic units of production. Families felt they needed to produce more children simply to keep afloat, and our economic system thought that children existed simply to generate profit. But in the course of the last hundred years, we’ve recognised once more the unique importance of treating children differently, conferring on children specific rights, and making sure that our education system recognises that, if children are to prosper and succeed, they need special care and attention in each stage of their development. The importance of conferring on young children special rights, and the importance of giving young children special support, is something that the Coalition Government believes we must not only grasp but deepen. Because the growing recognition of the special autonomy of young children - as well as the growing recognition of what they need - has been driven not just by a heightening sense of social awareness, but also by a deepening knowledge about the reality of what child development involves. We know that there are specific changes that occur in a child’s brain in the earliest years of its life that have a disproportionate impact on that child’s fate; on that child’s capacity to be able to make the right choices and avoid the wrong temptations. We know that the circumstances of nurture and attachment in the very earliest years of a child’s life will often determine the emotional generosity that that child shows later. We know that the range of stimuli that a child has early in life will determine whether or not that child is capable of responding well to other human beings; capable of absorbing knowledge; and capable of becoming a skilful and fully-rounded citizen in years to come. And that’s why, at the heart of what we’re seeking to do, is a renewed emphasis on the importance of the qualifications of those who work with young people. And that’s why we want to be guided by emerging science about how the brain develops. And why we want to look to emerging good practice on the ground from all of you represented here today and beyond. From those who are developing a better understanding of how to bring children up in a way that ensures that they’re resilient; that they’re intelligent; that they’re loving; and that they’re citizens of whom we can be proud, and whose values we admire. Now it must be recognised that child development is changing. It’s important that we’re aware of the sophistication of some of the arguments that are now being developed about how we can best support children. In the past, there tended to be something of a division between different views about how we should encourage children to become ready for school. And I’m going to caricature, to exaggerate in order to simplify - and, I hope, to illuminate. On the one hand were those people who believe that the single most important thing that you can do with children was encourage them to play, encourage them to take delight in exploring their curiosity, and that everything about a child’s learning in the very earliest years should be driven by a child’s own impulses and instincts. And this was a view which, without wanting to be too highfaluting about it, developed from the ideas of Rousseau and the principle that the newborn child was capable of infinite goodness, but it was society that corrupted them. The important thing to do was to allow that innocence to be sustained and to flourish for as long as possible. Now there was also an alternative view - a view that believes children should be institutionalised at the earliest possible age, and that there should be formality, rigor and structure to their learning. Yes, play has its role. But that role shouldn’t overwhelm the vital importance of making sure that children are acquainted, for example, with the letters of the alphabet or the sequence of numbers at the earliest possible stage. I exaggerate, but we are all aware of people who exemplify some of those impulses: those who argue that the most important thing to do at the beginning is to nurture creativity, and others who believe that children need to be introduced to a formal body of knowledge at the earliest possible stage. I think it’s really important that we acknowledge that there is truth to both traditions. It’s really important that we recognise that when children are playing, they are learning; and that creativity is essential to what great child development involves. But it’s also critical that we recognise that children do need to be introduced to formal knowledge in a way and at a time that is appropriate for their own development. Some of you like me may have grown up watching the genius that is Jim Henson and the Muppets of Sesame Street. You may wonder why I’m mentioning Big Bird now. The reason that Jim Henson is a genius is not just because he was an amazing puppeteer and a fantastic communicator and a great entertainer. He was also a genius because Sesame Street sought out children growing up in homes where parents weren’t taking them through their ABCs and their 123s, and introduced them to the alphabet and numerical progression. Because he recognised that the allocation of cultural capital in our society is unequal. He recognised that for those who are rich and well-connected, their book-rich homes and their opportunity-rich lives give the children a fantastic start in life. But for those who don’t have those opportunities - who don’t have access to literature at home, to museums, to cinema - it’s sometimes more difficult to get the stimuli that give young minds the opportunity to flourish. Jim Henson recognised that, which is why Sesame Street concentrated on giving children a route into formal knowledge. But no one watching Sesame Street would have thought that it was a dry as dust, Victorian-style, schoolroom approach to learning. Sesame Street’s approach was driven by the belief that learning should be fun, that it should be entertaining, and that it should be built around the child’s sense of growing wonder as they mastered more knowledge and became more confident in the way they interacted with others. The very, very best practice in the early years acknowledges the sheer pleasure that comes from spending time with children and the delight of seeing them enjoy themselves. But the best practice also devotes itself to ensuring that all children grow up equally literate, equally numerate and with equal levels of access to cultural capital. Every part of what the wealthiest in our society have taken for granted as their birthright, belongs to every child. Now in order to achieve that, we need to provide support for those working in the early years. We recognise the difficulties that some of you face, and we also recognise that there are some of the tremendous opportunities to deliver an even better service for the parents who depend on you. So I just want to say a little bit about what the Coalition Government proposes to do and how we hope to support you. Firstly, I’m aware that we’re all living through difficult economic times. One of the things that I saw in the newspapers just before I left was the Institute of Fiscal Studies report that drew attention to the fact that money was tighter than ever before. I was grateful to them for putting it on to the front page of the Daily Telegraph… but I didn’t really need it there in order to know it. As a constituency MP, as a Minister and as a father, I know that times are extraordinarily tight. I know that the money that’s available through the Early Intervention Grant and through the Dedicated Schools Grant is not as generous as any of us would like to see. However, what we have tried to do is two things. One is to allow as much flexibility as possible about how you spend that money. And the other is trying to ensure that the early years get their fair share. That’s why Sarah Teather fought a battle with the Treasury and made sure we honoured the last government’s guarantee of 15 free hours of pre-school learning for all three- and four-year-olds. Some people believe this was inevitably going to happen. It wasn’t. The move from twelve-and-a-half to 15 hours had to be fought for. And it was Sarah who won it for all of us. It was also Sarah who was instrumental in making sure that we extended 15 hours of free education to more disadvantaged two-year-olds. The last government, to their credit, introduced this offer to 20,000 two-year-olds. We’re extending it to 120,000. I’d like to go further. But at a time when there are so many cuts occurring, I think it’s testament to Sarah’s passion - and to her skill as a Minister - that she was able to get more money for a vital project at a time when funding was being reduced elsewhere. I know ‘you’re not suffering as badly as the next person’ is perhaps not the most inspiring message. And I know that the money you need is not there at the level you deserve. But we’re fighting hard to make sure that at a time of difficulty we do everything we can to support you. I’m also struck by the degree of leadership local government is showing. Of course the quality of councils varies. But I’m really impressed by the fact that local government as a whole is doing everything possible to keep children’s centres open and, more critically to my mind, to ensure that the services provided are preserved as well. There may be closures, there may be mergers, but there are also opportunities to ensure even better working. And I hope that our proposals to introduce payment by results will mean that those of you who are innovating will feel that we’re there to support you, to celebrate the superb practice that goes on, and to provide more resources for those who are in a position to be able to expand. Now of course in mentioning good practice, I have to underline our commitment to making sure that we provide you with the curriculum, materials, and methods of accountability to help you with the work that you do. That’s why I’m so grateful to Clare Tickell for having looked at the Early Years Foundation Stage; for reporting on how we can make it less bureaucratic; and for reflecting in her work the vital importance of balancing school readiness with an appreciation of the best contemporary research on child development. I know that many of you have engaged both with Dame Clare’s review, and subsequently, with the consultation about how best to implement it. There’s more to say and more to do. But to use a jargon phrase: this has been a co-creative exercise. The work has been done with you, in order to ensure that the materials we produce reflect the best practice on the ground. And talking again of best practice there on the ground, one of the other things I’m very conscious of is the divorce between the workforce in schools and the workforce in early years. And we’ve tended to think that those who work in schools are teachers; they have their fantastic unions - with whom we enjoy talking - and their wonderful union leaders who get to appear on Question Time. They’re the people who get to command media attention. And resources. And ministers’ diaries. The early years workforce is sometimes seen as an amorphous group, not least because it is split between DCLG and the Department for Education in terms of the responsibility that we take for it. Well I think the time has come (in fact I think it’s long overdue) for us to recognise that all those who work with children - from the moment that they’re conceived and born, to the moment that they go out into the world of work - make up one fused and united workforce. All of you are teachers. All of you are involved in the business of education. All of you care about how well children will be integrated into the community. All of you will have skills in pastoral care. All of you are intimately involved in making sure that children learn - and that they find learning fun and stimulating, from the very earliest months through to the rest of their lives. That’s why I believe that it’s critically important that we reinforce the importance of the workforce in the early years. And that means support for your professional development. It means making sure that we provide the best possible routes to allow you to improve your qualifications and it means eventually that we should have one fused and unified profession, so that from the earliest years, right through to college and university, we think of everyone involved in the business of education as a teacher: equally valued, equally respected, and with equal prestige and esteem in the eyes of society. So that’s why I’m so pleased that Sarah has launched the Nutbrown Review, which is going to look specifically at how we can enhance the level of support that we give to the early years workforce. We’re going to look at the qualifications you need, the assistance you require, the professional development that should be available, and what government - local and central - can do to ensure that we have the best-equipped workforce possible. I mentioned that cave in the Dordogne right at the beginning of my remarks. One of the reasons why that story stuck in my mind is because it reinforces a perception which has influenced me during my time in government. There are some things that Education Secretaries are inevitably judged by. These are often things that tend to happen later on in children’s schools lives. We tend to be judged by improvements in Key Stage 2 results; we tend to be judged by increases in attainment at GCSE; we tend to be judged by the number of students going on to top universities or into great apprenticeships. Actually, how we should be judged is very different. What we should be judged by is the quality of the relationships that we foster and that we allow to be created. In some respects, it’s intangible. It can’t be measured. Ofsted can’t pat you on the head because data show the quality of relationships in the institution that you’re responsible for are better than those down the road. But it’s the quality of relationships that determine the health, the welfare, the worth of a society. And the reason why that cavern image stays in my mind is because, at a time when life was exceptionally tough, when people were living through subsistence agriculture, and through hunting and gathering, it was still the case that parents made time to be with their children at the earliest points in their life. And whether by parents or carers, the hands of those children were guided as they were inducted into that society’s values - and they were encouraged to become creative and become young adults in turn. I think it would be a tragedy if we were to create a situation where we so privileged work, where we were so focused on those things that could be measured, that we actually, 10,000 years on, forgot that simple, but powerful lesson: that the most important thing that we can do is to be there to guide the hand of the next generation. To allow them to become truly creative. To allow them to take the path alongside us as proud, confident adults. To allow them to have a healthy relationship with us and with the rest of society. It’s because of the work that you do that I know that the quality of relationships for children now is going to be better than ever before. Thank you."
/government/news/government-brings-forward-plans-to-double-free-childcare-for-working-families,"Parents set to benefit from 30 hours of free childcare, with rollout to start from 2016 – a year earlier than planned. Childcare funding rates to increase, with review promised before summer. New government taskforce will introduce changes as soon as possible. Prime Minister David Cameron will today announce that the government will bring forward plans to double free childcare for working parents - with some families set to benefit as early as next year. The Childcare Bill, introduced tomorrow (Tuesday), will double free childcare available for all working parents of 3 and 4 year olds to 30 hours a week – available to up to 600,000 families and worth around £5,000 a year – including the £2,500 they can already save from existing free childcare offers. And, in a move to underline the government’s commitment to support working families with the costs of childcare, plans are being drawn up to introduce the changes for some families a year earlier than planned, with pilots in some areas offering 30 hours worth of free places from September 2016. On top of this, the government is also today committing to increase the average childcare funding rates paid to providers (the hourly funding provided for each free place) with the Department for Education set to begin a review before summer, overseen by Childcare Minister Sam Gyimah. A new government taskforce, headed by Minister of State for Employment Priti Patel, will also work to drive forward the plans and ensure not a moment is wasted in passing the benefits onto working families. Prime Minister David Cameron: My message is clear. This government is on the side of working people – helping them get on and supporting them at every stage of life. That is exactly why we are pressing ahead with these reforms - so that not a moment is lost in getting on with the task - going further than ever before to help with childcare costs, helping hardworking families and giving people the opportunity to get into work.” Minister for Employment, Priti Patel said: We are doing more than any other government to improve the affordability and accessibility of childcare for working families. Having the right childcare in place will mean more parents can have genuine choice, security and peace of mind when it comes to being able to support their family. Today’s announcement will mean there is now more support than ever before to help with the costs of childcare and will build on the steps already taken by this government to help families across the country. More than a million families are already benefiting from 15 hours week of free childcare for three and four-year olds, alongside around 160,000 of the most disadvantaged two year olds. The government has also already legislated to introduce tax free childcare – worth up to £2,000 per child per year – within this Parliament. View details of current free childcare entitlements for 2, 3 and 4 year olds . Notes to editors The legislation being introduced to Parliament would place a duty on the Secretary of State for Education to ensure 30 hours of childcare is provided to 3 and 4 year olds of working families during term-time. This includes the 15 hours currently available and the additional 15 hours. Further details will be set out in regulations, but will make clear that both parents should be in work or a lone parent who is in work. Currently around 600,000 families in England have 3 or 4 year old children with both parents in work. This number will change over time according to employment choices. Numbers of families taking up the enhanced entitlement will depend on parental choices: many of the 4 year olds will be in reception classes at school. It is important that the hourly rate for the childcare entitlement strikes the right balance between being fair for providers and delivering value for money to the taxpayer. To get this right, we will conduct a review of funding for the entitlement. 4 . Support for childcare put in place by the last government includes: funding 15 hours a week of free childcare for all 3 and 4 year olds – an increase from 12.5 hours saving families an additional £425 a year per child funding 15 hours a week of free childcare for all disadvantaged 2 year olds – for 40% of all 2 year olds, saving families over £2,500 a year per child legislating for tax free childcare which will save around 1.9 million working families with children under age 12 up to £2,000 per child per year increasing child tax credit entitlement up to £2,780 per year for families with one child, £480 more a year than 2010"
/government/news/setting-research-priorities-in-education-and-childrens-services,"Researchers, and those who work in education and children’s services, have been given the opportunity to discuss what the research priorities for those areas should be, how the gaps can best be filled and how research can influence policy development and delivery. As part of the department’s commitment to make its research more collaborative and driven by the needs of the education sector, a series of research priority and question papers have been published. These papers set out what the department thinks the important research questions are across our key policy areas. However they are also asking the public and interested parties to have their say on those priorities. This is to ensure that research carried out in education and children’s services by the department and by others helps government and practitioners access a growing evidence base which has real impact on policy design and delivery and drives further improvements. The department already has a growing base of evidence available to schools, education and children’s groups, local authorities and academics but we want to ensure that evidence continues to grow. Researchers who may already be working on these areas can also contact the department and ensure studies are linked up. A series of feedback sessions to discuss the papers further will be organised. For more information on how to get involved in those sessions or to comment on the papers: email us at research.priorities@education.gsi.gov.uk follow us on Twitter @educationgovuk and join the discussion using #DfEresearch like us on Facebook The department will continue to commission research.

/government/speeches/education-secretary-michael-goves-speech-to-ascl,"Good morning - and thank you for the very kind invitation to come to Birmingham this morning. My last visit here was made memorable by the warmth of the welcome I received from Ninestiles School, a secondary in a challenging area which has made fantastic progress under the leadership of Chris Quinn. It was a pleasure for me to talk to the students there and especially one sixth former - Cameron Kigonaye - whose parents are from Kenya and Cameroon and who is now course to read law at Oxford. It was a reminder of just how much latent talent we have in this country. I visited another outstanding school in challenging circumstances earlier this week - Freemantle Academy - in one of the most deprived parts of Southampton. The head there, Kevin Barratt, became a teacher after a successful career in consulting engineering - something that has proved useful in helping design the new buildings he has delivered for his school in record time. I was intrigued as to why Kevin had left one high-paying profession for another profession and why, having become a teacher, he wanted to become a head. “Simple, really” he replied. “I wanted to help children. And being a head gave me the chance to help more children.” In one sentence Kevin, I am certain, spoke for everyone in this room. The reason we work in education is because we want to help children. And the reason people take on leadership positions is they want to help as many children as possible. That is the central moral purpose that brought all of you into education. And it is what animates the work of the leaders whose schools I have been fortunate enough to visit in the last year. The magificent seven Like Amanda Philips in Old Ford Primary in Bow - whose students come from one of the poorest parts of one of the capital’s poorest boroughs but who leave with the sort of love of literature you’d expect of English undergraduates. Or Yasmin Bevan in Denbigh High in Luton- whose students again come from some of the most challenging areas of one of our most ethnically diverse cities and who again excel - securing superb results in the GCSEs which set them on course for the best universities. Or Pete Birkett - who leads the Barnfield Federation - whose studio school is delivering an amazing technical and academic education for those students - overwhelmingly from disadvantaged homes - who have struggled most at primary… And then there’s Jerry Collins from Pimlico - the head who has recorded the fastest progress yet in taking a school from categories to outstanding - and who is now devising a whole new secondary curriculum designed to ensure his students - again overwhelmingly from disadvantaged backgrounds - can out-compete privately educated children. Or Patricia Sowter - at Cuckoo Hall in Edmonton - whose students come from one of the poorest areas of the Labour borough of Enfield and who secures for every student - including those with special needs - Level 4 at Key Stage Two. Or Greg Wallace at Woodberry Down -whose students are drawn from the poorest parts of Hackney and who have benefitted hugely from a rigorous approach to reading in the early years which makes them enthusiastic devourers of every book they can get their hands on by years 4, 5 and 6. And I cannot miss out Barry Day - in Nottingham - who again draws his students from the most challenging neighbourhoods in an ethnically diverse city - and who generates outstanding academic results in an environment where grace, civility and cultural ambition are expected of every child. The reason I mention these - and I could mention many more - is that I don’t think any leader in education should give a speech - or appear in public to talk about education - without celebrating success and giving a shout-out to those who’ve achieved it. But there’s a special reason I mention these magnificent seven today. And it goes to the heart of the moral purpose of this Government. I’ve said in the past - will say again - and the evidence backs me up when I say it. We have the best generation of young teachers ever in our schools. We have the best generation of heads ever in our schools. And our whole school system is good- with many outstanding features. But our education system - our country- is still held back by two weaknesses. We have - for generations -failed to stretch every child to the limit of their ability. And we have - for all our lifetimes- failed the poorest most of all. And tackling these problems for me isn’t just business, it’s personal. When you spend the first months of your life in care. When you know your life could have taken many, very different, courses. But you know that education liberated you to enjoy opportunities your parents could scarcely have dreamt of, then you know that it’s a sin not to do everything in your power to help every child transcend the circumstances of their birth to achieve everything of which they’re capable. Which is where the magnificent seven come in. Every single one of them proves -every single day of their lives - that deprivation need not be destiny. That the assumptions of a generation ago of what students were capable of were narrow, limiting and unfair. And that with great teaching - and that’s really it - we can democratise access to knowledge, find the talent in every child and make opportunity more equal. We’re all in this to help children- as many children as possible. But when there are schools where more than forty per cent of children don’t reach an acceptable level of reading, writing and maths then there are more children who still need our help. And when children eligible for free school meals are in schools where they fall further and further behind their peers at every stage of their education then there are more children who still need our help. And when children from wealthy homes who go to schools in comfortable areas are getting the GCSEs that give them a wide choice of futures - and poorer children going to schools in poorer areas aren’t getting those GCSEs then there are more children who still need our help. The terrible temptation of fatalism Yet from some quarters in the political world there’s still a lack of rooted determination to make all our schools excellent, because there are individuals who have succumbed to the terrible temptation of fatalism. They believe that there are some children who cannot be expected to succeed. They hold that there are some students who will never transcend the circumstances of their birth. For some - usually on the right - there can only ever be a small percentage of children who either can - or even deserve - to make it to the top. They see society either as a pyramid or a bell curve. Those with the intelligence to make something of themselves are the minority at the far right of that bell curve - the cognitive elite - those with a higher than average IQ who are - by definition - only ever a minority of the population. Sometimes injustices, or inefficiencies, mean that those at the far right of the bell curve do not make it to the top of the pyramid - but beyond ensuring that the minority who are smart are also the minority who are rich there is nothing much more to be done. For others - usually on the left - the existence of material inequality determines everything - and as long as there are differentials of wealth and background you can never expect real progress to be made. From their point of view, poor children cannot succeed because their circumstances prevent it. Poor children will lag behind their wealthier peers in any school that educates both. And a school with a large number of poor children will be so weighed down - or held back - by the socio-economic background of its intake that those children will always be at a disadvantage. Only if every school has as close to an identical intake as possible will every child have as close to an identical chance as possible. You cannot solve in the classroom the problems created by fundamental class divisions. Both the Bell Curve Right and the Class Struggle Left agree on more than they might like to admit. Both agree that there are some children who won’t succeed because of their background. Both would say of our weakest schools - where poor students from poor homes do poorly - well, what do you expect? Both of them, however, are wrong. We know they’re wrong because there are schools in this country with very challenging intakes - with a higher than average proportion of children with special needs, a higher than average number eligible for free school meals, a higher than average number who don’t have English as a first language - that outperform schools with much more favoured intakes in much wealthier areas. Schools such as those I mention run by the Magnificent Seven, and by so many others of you here in this hall. More than that, many of these schools prove that there need be no difference in performance - none - between students from disadvantaged circumstances and students from wealthier homes. No such thing as an attainment gap There is no such thing as an attainment gap at Cuckoo Hall or at Thomas Jones Primary in North Kensington. In both schools exactly the same percentage of children eligible for Free School Meals reach an acceptable level in English and Maths as children from wealthier homes - and in both cases that is 100%. There are more than forty primaries across the country which have achieved the same - eliminating any attainment gap between rich and poor. The same has been done at secondary level as well. At Paddington Academy, which has an especially challenging intake, there is no difference in pupil performance on the basis of background. These schools demonstrate on the ground what brain science is telling us in learned journals and best-selling paperbacks. There is nothing determined, fixed or immutable about a child’s chances of success. Neither the genetic or material inheritance of any child need automatically determine how far they will rise, or what achievements they might secure. In Matthew Syed’s ‘Bounce’, in Malcolm Gladwell’s ‘Outliers’ and - most comprehensively of all - in David Shenk’s The Genius in All of Us, the evidence shows that hard work, application and properly directed activity can produce phenomenal results in almost any individual. If an individual has the will, if we as society have the will, we can achieve far, far more than we may have ever imagined. Shenk shows us that genes do not immutably dictate our destiny - it is the interplay between what we inherit and the environment and culture in which we grow up which determines what we become. He, and Syed, and Gladwell, all prove with countless examples that effort and application can generate success in almost any field. And if children are educated in an environment where hard work is expected, where every child is assumed capable of success, and no excuses are allowed for failure, then children will succeed - from any background. What Shenk, Syed and Gladwell believe is what the best schools ¬ in this country and across the world - are putting into practice. In King Solomon Academy in Lisson Grove - in the top 10 per cent of the most deprived schools in London - it is expected that every student - every student - will make it onto higher education. The school hours are longer - the homework is demanding - the expectations pitched deliberately high. Children study Shakespearean tragedies in depth, Jane Austen, Aldous Huxley and Primo Levi. In Pimlico Academy - which again draws students from some of the toughest parts of London - every young person is equipped with a level of cultural literacy designed to make university natural. They study the Renaissance architecture of Brunelleschi and Bernini alongside the role of Archbishop Laud and Henrietta Maria in provoking the English Civil War. In Thomas Jones, a primary, children who are ten and eleven - again drawn from some of London’s most challenging areas - are called scholars and taught what scholarship means - through the medium of works by Dickens, Wilde, Blake, Larkin, Matthew Arnold and Tennyson. These high expectations - and the hard work required to meet them - generate not just statistically astounding results, they also transform the lives of children from the poorest homes. They are given access to the same cultural heritage wealthier children expect as of right, they are capable of exceeding the performance, in any test of knowledge or ability, expected of far wealthier children, they are set for success in any field. It is because we cannot allow children to suffer - when we know they can achieve so much more - that we are pressing ahead with our reform programme. And it is because all of you I know are dedicated to making opportunity more equal that I am so grateful for your support in this work. The World at an inflection point And lest anyone think we should slacken the pace of reform - let me reassure them - we have to accelerate. Over the next ten years the world we inhabit will change massively. We are at an inflection point in the economic and educational development of nations. Technology will change out of all recognition how individuals work, how we teach and how students learn. Millions more across the globe will go onto higher - and post-graduate education. Globalisation will see the number of unskilled or low skilled jobs in this country diminish further and the rewards to those with higher level qualifications continue to soar further ahead. We cannot ignore, wish away or seek to stand aside from these developments. Not least because they promise a dramatic step forward in the unleashing of talent, the fulfilment of human potential and the reach of our creativity. So we need to have an education system equipped for that world - one which equips young people for all its challenges - and opportunities. We need to cultivate higher order thinking skills and creativity. We need to be adaptable and fleet-footed. We need to welcome innovation and challenge as a way to ensure we lead rather than meekly follow. And it’s a consciousness of the changes which are sweeping across the world which drives our education reform programme. We need to ensure every child achieves their fullest potential because we need every mind motivated to succeed if our society as a whole is to prosper. The five pillars of reform - a vision beyond 2020 And it’s an awareness of the scale of reform needed which is driving change in each area of our policy programme. In funding In human capital In the curriculum and qualifications In accountability And in the structures we create to drive innovation and excellence. In funding - we must over the next ten years move away from a system in which no-one ¬ literally no-one - can explain why schools receive the sums they do. Where pupils with the same needs in different parts of the country receive wildly differing sums for their education. Where the amount spent to help the poorest is arbitrarily distributed and where accountability for how money is spent is opaque and confused, to a much more rational system with a set amount for every child - related to their age - and course. With an additional sum - the pupil premium - for every poor child and special support for schools in exceptional circumstances or children with special needs. Money should more transparently follow students, schools should be freer to expand, and accountability for what is done with that money must be clearer. If we move to such a system - the unfairness of our current funding arrangements will become a thing of the past. On human capital - we must continue the trend we’ve seen over the last fifteen years of recruiting more talented people into teaching - no education system can be better than its teachers. So we need to remove one of the biggest barriers to people staying in teaching - poor behaviour and discipline - which we’re doing with reforms to make detention simpler, exclusion easier and fairer, attendance easier to police and adult authority unquestioned. We also need to support the best students, particularly in disciplines such as maths and science, to come into the classroom - which we’re doing by paying them more. We need to ensure they are prepared better for the classroom - which we’re doing by reforming teacher training to reward those institutions with the highest standards. And we need to ensure there is high quality and well-funded continuous professional development - which we’re doing through the National College, Teaching Schools, the growth in academy chains and the work of organisations like the Prince’s Teaching Institute. And if we embrace these changes media and political criticism of professional standards in teaching will become a thing of the past. On the curriculum and qualifications: We need to encourage much greater creativity - led by teachers -which is why we’re allowing academies total curriculum freedom and stripping back prescription in the national curriculum for non-core subjects. We need to move away from an expensive and time-consuming culture of proliferating external examinations - modules, re-sits and retakes - towards fewer high quality qualifications overseen and conferred not by commercial organisations but by institutions of academic excellence such as our best universities. We need to see innovation in new areas such as computer science. And we also need to ensure a higher level of cultural literacy and greater familiarity for all students from all backgrounds with the best that’s been thought and written globally. And if we ensure we deliver these changes concerns about dumbing down and sheep and goat divisions between academic and vocational will become a thing of the past. On accountability: We need more data not less. We must move away from reliance on just one or two benchmarks to a rich and nuanced account of achievement. Every month, week, day and hour we have data about the economic performance of the nation. But for years we have only two reliable - and publicly shared - data sets about our children’s development - at 11 and 16 - based on levels which few parents understand or GCSE performance narrowly measured. We need to know more about how our children are doing. Which schools are succeeding - and why. Which pedagogies are working - and why. Which leaders are proving transformational - and why. And that data will of course be complemented by thoughtful inspection from professionals. Which is why I want Ofsted to be run by, with, and for school leaders. And why I think Michael Wilshaw is absolutely right to say he wants more and more inspection to be done by and with the people in this hall - not to them. And if we secure those changes then accountability as a crude filter will become a thing of the past and instead it will be a powerful means of continual self-improvement. And on our structures: I think we need to welcome innovation and flexibility. That’s why I am delighted so many of you have chosen to become academies - more than 40% of secondaries now enjoy academy freedom and now more primaries are applying than secondaries every month. That’s why I am delighted that free schools are up and running - and more are opening - led by great heads and pioneering new ways of teaching and learning. It’s why I welcome the injection of new thinking which has come into communities where under-performance has been entrenched as more and more academies - many represented in this hall - open their own free schools, sponsor existing schools and enter new partnerships and federations. Because access to the education children need is still rationed by the inflexible structures we all inherited. Just a few days ago we had the annual recording of how many parents had failed to secure a place for their child at the school they hoped for. Under the system we want to build - with good schools expanding, sponsoring others, new entrants providing choice and challenge and parents empowered to choose - the annual wrangle over admissions and the creation of fixed hierarchies of schools will become a thing of the past. But the thing which I wish most of all to consign to the past is the fatalism which holds that this country cannot be the best-educated in the world, the fairest and the most open. Because I know how offensive that is to the people in this room - how belittling of their talent, how dismissive of their ambition, how ignorant of the moral purpose which drives you to all work so hard. We all know the truth of the words of Martin Luther King in his letter from a Birmingham jail: Human progress never rolls in on wheels of inevitability - it comes through tireless effort - and without this hard work time itself becomes an ally of the forces of social stagnation. I am an enemy of all the forces of social stagnation. And there are no better allies to have in defeating those forces than all of you in this room. It is to defeating those forces that I know all your amazing hard and tireless work is dedicated - for which I thank you. Ends"
/government/news/ofsted-reports-to-wolverhampton-council-after-focused-inspections,"The focused inspections are part of a concerted programme of action by Ofsted to establish why children in some parts of the country have a much lower chance of attending a good or better school than their peers in other similar areas. In Wolverhampton, Ofsted’s main concern focuses on the fact that too few pupils reach a good stage of development at the end of either the Early Years Foundation Stage (age 5) or Key Stage 1 (age 7). During the inspections, Ofsted also gathered information on local authority support for school improvement by asking key questions to the headteachers of a further 14 schools, selected randomly from good or better schools within the area. Of the 13 schools inspected: none were judged outstanding 7 were good 5 were requires improvement 1 was judged to require special measures – this school had declined from a previously good rating The findings show that the number of schools which require improvement or are inadequate are also well above national figures, with nearly half of schools failing to improve their grade in-between inspections. Whilst there is some evidence of effective intervention and support by the local authority, Ofsted has highlighted a number of areas for improvement. This includes the need for: the local authority to ensure that schools have a greater understanding of its long-term plans for school improvement schools to understand the type of support they should be receiving from the authority – as many headteachers and governors describe the current support as weak Commenting on the findings, Ofsted’s Regional Director for the West Midlands, Lorna Fitzjohn, said: Ofsted’s focused inspections are part of an initiative to highlight areas where children are not receiving a good enough level of education. Our inspections in Wolverhampton have shown that too many young people are being failed through the education they are receiving. What is even more worrying is that nearly half of the schools inspected have failed to improve since they were last visited. This lack of progress in improving schools cannot be allowed to continue. I therefore urge the council to carefully consider today’s findings and work with us to improve the provision of schooling, with the aim of giving all young people in the city the standard of education they deserve. The letter is on Wolverhampton’s page on Ofsted’s reports website . Notes to editors The primary schools inspected were: Bushbury Hill Primary School; Springdale Junior School; Hill Avenue Primary School; Dunstall Hill Primary School; Woodfield Junior School; Whitgreave Infant School; Rakegate Primary School; Palmers Cross Primary School; Woodthorne Primary School; Bantock Primary School; and St Thomas’ Church of England Primary School. The secondary schools inspected were: Deansfield Community School, Specialists In Media Arts; and Moreton Community School. On 17 January 2013, Ofsted announced the first wave of focused school inspections across local authority areas, where children are being denied the standard of education they deserve. The press release is available on the Ofsted website. Local authority areas were selected for the focused school inspection programme on the basis of the relative proportion of children attending good or better primary schools, as set out in the last Ofsted Annual Report, and Ofsted data on the proportion of children attending good or better secondary schools, as well as any relevant inspection evidence gathered during the autumn 2012 term. These are standard section 5 inspections, which were scheduled to take place this academic year and include all types of schools – although the majority will be primary schools. The Office for Standards in Education, Children’s Services and Skills (Ofsted) regulates and inspects to achieve excellence in the care of children and young people, and in education and skills for learners of all ages. It regulates and inspects childcare and children’s social care, and inspects the Children and Family Court Advisory Support Service (Cafcass), schools, colleges, initial teacher training, work-based learning and skills training, adult and community learning, and education and training in prisons and other secure establishments. It assesses council children’s services, and inspects services for looked after children, safeguarding and child protection. [Contact:2325]"

/government/news/education-bill-receives-royal-assent,"The coalition government’s Education Bill has today been granted Royal Assent. This completes the legislative framework for the government’s key education reforms, and paves the way for important changes in schools in England. Education Bill receives Royal Assent The Education Act 2011 will help teachers raise standards in education. It includes new legal powers to help teachers root out poor behaviour, to tackle underperformance, and to improve the way in which schools are held to account. Provisions in the Act include: a power for schools to search pupils without consent for any dangerous or banned items the removal of restrictions that prevent schools from issuing detentions to pupils without providing 24 hours’ written notice new pre-charge reporting restrictions on allegations of criminal offences made by pupils against teachers at their school a power to create an entitlement to free early years provision for disadvantaged two-year-olds reforms to the procedure for the establishment of new schools, to give preference to Academies and Free Schools a re-focusing of Ofsted routine school inspections on four key areas that matter most to parents a power to exempt schools from routine Ofsted inspections new powers to tackle underperforming schools, including extended powers for the Secretary of State to close them the abolition of five existing arms-length bodies, with some of their functions transferring to more efficient new executive agencies, which are directly accountable to the Secretary of State. Schools Minister Nick Gibb said: This new legislation hands to teachers all the powers they need to ensure that every classroom is a safe and ordered place where children are free to learn. It focuses school inspection on educational standards and strengthens school accountability to drive continued improvement in academic standards. We are determined to deliver for parents the type of schools they want for their children and this new Education Act is an important part of this programme. The Department for Education has received Royal Assent for two significant Bills since the Coalition Government came to power. Both provide powers to transform the education system and raise standards in schools. The first - the Academies Act 2010 - gave all schools the chance to enjoy Academy freedoms. This year, Academies reported GCSE improvement rates double that of the national average. More than 1,500 schools have also applied to become Academies - meaning that 40 per cent of secondary schools are, or are seeking to become, Academies. The Act also enabled new Free Schools to be set up in communities where there is demand from local parents for a good, new school. The first 24 Free Schools opened this year, and many more are aiming to open in 2012 and beyond. Many of these schools are - or plan to be - based in areas of deprivation. The Academies Act 2010 laid the legal foundations that are allowing important structural changes to take place in the education system, by giving teachers, heads and other local people the powers and autonomy they need to raise standards. The Education Act 2011 will build on the significant structural changes made possible by the Academies Act - allowing the reforms made to the schools system to go even further. Most provisions in the Act will take force within the next two months; those relating to abolition of most arms-length bodies will take effect around the end of the financial year; and the remainder of the Act commencing at the start of the next school year.  Notes to editors The Education Act has four main themes: Good behaviour and discipline We must support teachers by giving them powers to ensure good behaviour and discipline. The Act will: Allow same-day after school detentions. Provide a power to search pupils for any item likely to cause harm or injury. Give teachers pre-charge anonymity when faced with an allegation by a pupil that they have committed an offence, to prevent false accusations being used to undermine teachers’ authority. Sharper accountability With increased freedom, should come sharper accountability. The Act: Focuses Ofsted inspections on four key areas - pupil achievement; quality of teaching; leadership and management; and behaviour and safety. Creates a power to end routine inspections of outstanding schools and colleges. Ensures that Ofqual, the independent regulator, must ensure our exams system is as robust and strong as the best around the world. It also gives Ofqual greater enforcement powers. Strengthens the Government’s powers to intervene in poorly performing schools. Abolishes five quangos, with many of their activities ending. Makes the Secretary of State directly accountable to Parliament for important functions, such as the barring of teachers. Freeing up professionals We need to free teachers and school and college leaders from bureaucracy so they have the autonomy to use their skills and judgement to meet the needs of all their children. The Act will remove unnecessary duties on schools. It extends the Academies and Free School programme further with Academies for 16 to 19 year olds and alternative provision Academies for the most vulnerable children. Using resources fairly The Act takes forward the “fairness premium” by: Providing the power to create an entitlement to free early years provision for disadvantaged two year olds. For new higher education students, the Act helps enable the new progressive student finance arrangements - the lowest earning 25 per cent of graduates will pay less over their lifetime than under the current system. Most provisions in the Act will be commenced within the next two months, with those relating to abolition of arms-length bodies being commenced at the end of the financial year and the remainder at the start of the school year in September 2012. A statement setting out when provisions in the Act will be commenced will be placed on this website. [Contact:997] Website: www.education.gov.uk/help/contactus"
/government/news/teach-first-leadership-development-programme-extended-to-cover-early-years,"Committed and talented people who want to work with young children will be able to train to teach with Teach First, the government announced today. Teach First’s reach will be extended so that young children get better quality early education and the early years profession gets the respect it deserves. The charity’s primary provision currently only reaches children aged 5 and over. This will be extended so that children aged 3 and 4 will also be covered. From September 2013, 20 recruits will begin working with younger children. There will be another roll-out in September 2014. Elizabeth Truss, Education and Childcare Minister, said: Parents want and deserve high-quality early education for their young children. The extension of the Teach First Leadership Development Programme into the early years will mean talented individuals will be even more attracted to this important profession which makes all the difference to young lives. I hope it will encourage bright graduates who otherwise may not have considered working with young children. Teach First has an excellent reputation for delivering high-quality teachers. This announcement will help to capitalise on this expertise for the early years profession to get the status it deserves. It will also drive up early education quality in poorer areas where it is most needed. Trainees will do a 2 year training programme while working full time in schools, nurseries and other early years providers in poorer areas. They will gain a post-graduate certificate in education at the end of year one. Young children will be able to benefit from high-quality graduate leadership. Teach First is a charity which recruits, trains and supports people with leadership potential to become inspirational teachers in schools in low-income communities across the UK. In the past 10 years more than 400,000 young people have been taught by Teach First teachers. John Colenutt, acting Chief Executive Officer of Teach First, said: We know the impact of a great teacher and how vital it is to intervene as early as possible to ensure that every child receives a great education. This is an exciting development for Teach First and is allowing us to respond to the needs of our partner schools which are keen for us to provide graduates to teach their younger pupils. We are tailoring the training for those who will be working with 3- to 7-year-olds to ensure that they are fully equipped to manage the very different demands of the early years context, and to support the children in their care. Notes to editors Teach First’s vision is that no child’s educational success is limited by their socio-economic background. It believes that the scale of change needed is so great it requires a movement of leaders to make a difference at a pupil, school and system level. Trainees commit to a minimum of 2 years at their partner school, where they teach a newly qualified teacher ( NQT ) timetable; and nearly 3 quarters choose to stay for at least a third year. Their 13 month initial teacher training starts with the unique 6 week summer institute which provides trainees with intensive preparation for teaching in their school. Trainees then complete both their post-graduate certificate in education training year and their first year as an NQT in their school. The Effective Provision of Pre-School Education Project found that the quality of early years provision is related to better intellectual and cognitive, and social and behavioural development, in children when they begin primary school.

/government/news/consultation-launched-on-free-early-education,"The Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg and Children’s Minister Sarah Teather set out the plans in a consultation on changes to free early education. The consultation includes proposals to: Make the free entitlement to 15 hours per week of early education more flexible, so it can be taken between 7am and 7pm, and spread across two days instead of the current three days. Use the criteria which is used for free school meals to decide which disadvantaged two-year-olds should qualify for free early education, Include two-year-olds who are looked after by the state in the eligibility criteria for free early education. Slim down statutory guidance for local authorities from 100 pages to fewer than 20 pages. Under the plans, up to 140,000 disadvantaged two-year-olds will be entitled to 15 hours a week of free early education. The announcement follows the Government’s commitment, made by the Deputy Prime Minister in October 2010, to extend 15 hours of free early education - currently available to all three- and four-year-olds - to disadvantaged two-year-olds from September 2013. Nick Clegg said: I want us to give every child the best possible start - so free education for toddlers from the most disadvantaged homes will now be a right and not a privilege. Crucially the extra care will be flexible and easy to access. Parents across the country are bending over backwards to balance work and home. The Coalition wants to help in whatever way we can. Sarah Teather, Children’s Minister, said: Our priority is to increase social mobility by helping children from the poorest backgrounds in their earliest years. High quality early education is the key to making a difference early on in a child’s life. It’s crucial for their healthy development and means they’re not falling behind before they have even started primary school. We want more children to be able to access their full early education entitlement. Too often, the most disadvantaged children don’t get what they are entitled to. It’s important we target early education at those who stand to benefit the most. We also want to make the entitlement more flexible, so that children don’t miss out on early education and parents can help balance their work and family life more easily. All 152 local authorities in England have been delivering a targeted offer of between 10 and 15 hours of free early education to some of the most disadvantaged two-year-olds since September 2009. The extension of 15 hours to all disadvantaged two-year-olds will mean an increase in the number of places across the country, from 20,000 per year to around 140,000 per year. The Department is funding 15 trials in 18 local authorities to test approaches to expand free early education for disadvantaged two-year-olds. The trials are looking at the challenges that local areas face to deliver the expansion as well as helping them to share learning and best practice across the country. The trials will run until 31 March 2012. The Department is also consulting on how to improve the way in which local authorities tell parents how they are ensuring sufficient childcare places in the local area. An annual report to parents would replace the overly bureaucratic childcare sufficiency assessment that local authorities must currently do every three years. Notes to editors The consultation is published on our consultations web page. It will run until 31 January 2012. Subject to passage of the current Education Bill and regulations, local authorities will have a statutory duty to provide 15 hours of free early education and childcare to disadvantaged two-year-olds from September 2013. Funding is being given to all local authorities from this financial year in order to build up to the new entitlement. £64 million in 2011-12, £223 million in 2012-13, £331 million in 2013-14 and £380 million in 2014-15. This is part of the Early Intervention Grant for the first two years. The consultation asks for views on the best funding route from 2013-14 onwards. The number of disadvantaged two-year-olds who stand to benefit are listed below, by local authority: Number of families with a child aged two, with an income of £16,190 or less and receiving Child Tax Credit, April 2011. These indicative figures are derived from a sample. Numbers at local authority level are relatively small, so are subject to statistical error. In forecasting eligibility for the two year old offer, local authorities may also want to draw on other available information, such as numbers and proportions of school age children known to be eligible for free school meals, and demographic projections.   Number (to the nearest hundred)     ENGLAND 136,400     NORTH EAST 7,900 Darlington 200 Durham 1,700 Gateshead 600 Hartlepool 400 Middlesbrough 600 Newcastle upon Tyne 900 North Tyneside 500 Northumberland 600 Redcar and Cleveland 400 South Tyneside 500 Stockton-on-Tees 700 Sunderland 1,000     NORTH WEST 20,100 Blackburn with Darwen 600 Blackpool 500 Bolton 1,000 Bury 500 Cheshire East 600 Cheshire West and Chester 700 Cumbria 900 Halton 500 Knowsley 600 Lancashire 2,700 Liverpool 1,800 Manchester 2,300 Oldham 800 Rochdale 900 Salford 900 Sefton 500 St. Helens 600 Stockport 600 Tameside 700 Trafford 300 Warrington 400 Wigan 800 Wirral 1,000     YORKSHIRE AND THE HUMBER 14,700 Barnsley 800 Bradford 1,900 Calderdale 600 Doncaster 1,000 East Riding of Yorkshire 400 Kingston Upon Hull, City of 1,100 Kirklees 1,000 Leeds 2,300 North East Lincolnshire 600 North Lincolnshire 400 North Yorkshire 700 Rotherham 800 Sheffield 1,600 Wakefield 1,000 York 300     EAST MIDLANDS 10,800 Derby 700 Derbyshire 1,600 Leicester 1,400 Leicestershire 900 Lincolnshire 1,800 Northamptonshire 1,700 Nottingham 1,200 Nottinghamshire 1,500 Rutland -     WEST MIDLANDS 16,800 Birmingham 4,700 Coventry 900 Dudley 900 Herefordshire 300 Sandwell 1,400 Shropshire 400 Solihull 400 Staffordshire 1,600 Stoke-on-Trent 1,100 Telford and Wrekin 600 Walsall 1,200 Warwickshire 1,000 Wolverhampton 1,100 Worcestershire 1,100     EAST OF ENGLAND 13,100 Bedford Borough 500 Cambridgeshire 1,100 Central Bedfordshire 500 Essex 2,700 Hertfordshire 2,200 Luton 700 Norfolk 2,000 Peterborough 700 Southend-on-Sea 600 Suffolk 1,600 Thurrock 600     LONDON 26,300 Barking and Dagenham 1,200 Barnet 800 Bexley 700 Brent 1,000 Bromley 700 Camden 600 City of London - Croydon 1,400 Ealing 1,100 Enfield 1,400 Greenwich 1,100 Hackney 1,000 Hammersmith and Fulham 500 Haringey 1,000 Harrow 400 Havering 500 Hillingdon 900 Hounslow 900 Islington 800 Kensington and Chelsea 300 Kingston upon Thames 300 Lambeth 1,300 Lewisham 1,100 Merton 500 Newham 1,100 Redbridge 600 Richmond upon Thames 200 Southwark 900 Sutton 500 Tower Hamlets 1,200 Waltham Forest 1,000 Wandsworth 700 Westminster 600     SOUTH EAST 16,800 Bracknell Forest 300 Brighton and Hove 600 Buckinghamshire 700 East Sussex 1,100 Hampshire 2,100 Isle of Wight 300 Kent 3,300 Medway 700 Milton Keynes 800 Oxfordshire 1,000 Portsmouth 600 Reading 400 Slough 500 Southampton 900 Surrey 1,600 West Berkshire 300 West Sussex 1,300 Windsor and Maidenhead - Wokingham 200     SOUTH WEST 10,000 Bath and North East Somerset 200 Bournemouth 400 Bristol, City of 1,200 Cornwall 900 Devon 1,200 Dorset 700 Gloucestershire 800 Isles of Scilly - North Somerset 400 Plymouth 700 Poole 300 Somerset 900 South Gloucestershire 500 Swindon 600 Torbay 400 Wiltshire 700 Source: HMRC www.hmrc.gov.uk/stats/personal-tax-credits/cwtc-geog-stats.htm Figures are estimates, subject to statistical error. 95% confidence intervals for an estimate of 500 children are plus or minus 88 children; for an estimate of 1,000 are plus or minus 124; and for an estimate of 2,000 are plus or minus 175 (for couples with children, lone parents imply a larger confidence interval) No adjustment is made to reflect that some families will have more than one child aged two.

/government/news/boost-for-childminders-and-hardworking-families,"Hardworking parents stand to save money in a new measure to increase childcare options across the country, Education and Childcare Minister Elizabeth Truss announced today. The number of childminders has almost halved over the last 20 years and plans unveiled today aim to cut the red tape burden from childminders who look after children in their homes and give them the support, training and advice they need to deliver a high-quality service for parents. Earlier this month, figures showed that the cost to parents of after-school care provided by childminders has fallen for the first time in 12 years - from £72.79 to £64.75, potentially saving parents up to £420 per year. However, there is much more to do, which is why today we are announcing a freeze on the fees childminders pay to Ofsted for the fifth year in a row, keeping them at a low £35 per year. Childminder agencies are also being introduced to boost the number of people joining the profession - giving parents more choice and flexibility to meet their childcare needs. Education and Childcare Minister Elizabeth Truss said: I want parents to have better access to affordable, high-quality childcare. Freezing fees and reducing the bureaucracy will encourage new childminders to enter this vital profession. We know that good early education gives children the best possible start in life. Childminders are an important part of this and offer huge flexibility for parents - we want to see their numbers increase. A recent report found that after 12 years of consistently rising prices, costs in England have fallen for the first time - putting more money in the pockets of parents. Figures also show that more families are using nannies and nanny shares - indicating parents’ need for home-based flexible care. Alongside the fees freeze, a consultation has today been published to look at the technical details of how childminder agencies will operate from September 2014. The consultation will look at: the annual fee agencies will pay in line with that of nurseries at £220 the number of hours of professional development offered to childminders the number of quality assurance visits provided by the agency the number of hours of direct support from agencies to childminders the role of local authorities, particularly the power they have to intervene in local markets and their role in delivery Bolton headteacher and childcare provider Jack Hatch, who plans to open a childminder agency and has been involved in a trial said: This will benefit children and parents so much. Parents can have a relationship with the agency and have a point of contact beyond the childminder. They have support if for any reason the childminder isn’t available. Children can gain so much more from the exciting experiences and opportunities they get from their individual childminder having more professional development and support. As an agency we are involved in the pilot inspections by Ofsted and this is proving so helpful in checking our documentation and procedures and giving us the security to know we are on the correct path. Professor Kathy Sylva from Oxford University said: There is an exciting opportunity for childminder agencies to work more closely to their mutual benefit with teaching schools or primary schools with foundation stage provision: parents would then have access to a blend of centre-based and home-based care, which might benefit parents and children alike.” The Children and Families Act introduced the powers to create childminder agencies and the consultation builds on this to create a service that is functional and flexible for all. The government has also taken further action to reduce the burden on childminders by removing the requirement for separate registration if a childminder is providing food - this will now be done automatically when they are registered with Ofsted. In September good and outstanding childminders were enabled to offer the free 15 hours of childcare for 3- and 4-year-olds. The government has also announced further help for working families, including the new Tax-Free Childcare scheme . As part of the long-term economic plan, tax-free childcare will enable more parents to go out to work, if they want to, to provide greater security for their families. Background See the consultation document . The registration and annual fee for early years childminders on the ‘Early years register’ has been £35 since September 2010. The registration and annual fee for later years childminders on the ‘General childcare register’ has been £103 since September 2008. In cases, where a childminder is on both registers the lower fee applies. Becoming part of a childminder agency is optional. [Contact:997]"

/government/speeches/sarah-teather-sets-out-overarching-vision-for-early-years-services-in-nursery-world,"Human rights campaigner and writer Elie Wiesel once famously warned US Congressmen about the “perils of indifference” after he was invited to speak at the White House. The writer’s words were made in the run-up to the new millennium, in a speech that called for a 21st-century style of international politics, where the poorest were helped the most. Sadly, following a decade of distinctly 20th-century politics, we still seem no closer to achieving Wiesel’s vision in this country. Scandalously, parental background remains the key determining factor in whether your child goes on to lead a FTSE 100 company or a life of unemployment. And, as any professional who works with children will know, there is overwhelming evidence that these kinds of divisions are accelerated and deepened if you don’t address them during the first months and years of a child’s life. Research clearly shows that good-quality childcare provision does, in fact, benefit children in the long term, and in particular the most disadvantaged. The Effective Provision of Pre-School Education (EPPE) project, for instance, has shown that high-quality, pre-school provision enhances children’s all round cognitive, language and social development. And Leon Feinstein’s research on the correlation between social-economic status and the attainment of children gives us a clear basis for intervening early to tackle disadvantage through good early years support. In a fair and just society, that support should be available to every child, regardless of their family’s income or background. To make it easier for families to access this provision more flexibly, I announced on Monday that we will extend free childcare for 3- and 4-year-olds to 15 hours a week. We will also fund early learning and childcare for more than 20,000 of the most disadvantaged 2-year-olds and will be looking at how this could be extended to help support families who will benefit the most. In the current financial climate, it is our responsibility to ensure that we get value for money. But nothing matters more, or makes more financial sense, than intervening early to help the most vulnerable. Over 95% of families are taking up their free entitlement offer, but there are disproportionally more disadvantaged families among those who don’t. That’s why I am asking Sure Start children’s centres to redouble their efforts to do all they can to encourage these families to take up their free childcare offer. Sure Start children’s centres are a fantastic service for families, and I want them to remain universal. But their purpose should be to help the neediest families. I know that many children’s centres are doing innovative work reaching out to their communities. But there is more we can do. Health visitors have a crucial role in reaching out to vulnerable families, from pregnancy right through the early years of a child’s life. That’s why we are committed to dramatically increasing the number of Sure Start health visitors to make sure more vulnerable families are accessing these services. As a government, it is our responsibility to help each and every child achieve their full potential, whatever their background or circumstances. We believe in trusting professionals to do their jobs, free from the top-down bureaucracy of recent years. Most fundamentally, we believe that the government should take action to support the disadvantaged and that this support, whether through free childcare, the pupil premium or early intervention, is crucial to unlocking social mobility and overcoming indifference."

The release also includes the percentage of children achieving each individual scale point for each scale of the EYFSP. This data is currently submitted on a voluntary basis by local authorities. This statistical release was published on 11 November 2011 and replaces the release of 20 October 2011. The information included in this publication is sourced from the early years foundation stage profile census. Further guidance and technical specifications for the census is available. The key points from this release are: The majority of children (ranging from 67% to 91%) continue to work securely within (achieving a total of 6 points or more, see background note 4) the early learning goals, in each of the 13 assessment scales. The percentage of children working securely within has increased in 11 scales compared with 2010 and remained the same in the remaining 2. Since the implementation of the statutory EYFS profile in 2009, there has been an increase in the percentage of children working securely across all scales, with the largest increase 5 percentage points which was seen in 3 scales (communication, language and literacy - ie linking sounds and letters and writing - and problem solving, reasoning and numeracy - ie calculating). The assessment scales with the highest percentage of children working securely within the early learning goals were: physical development (91%) and personal, social and emotional development: dispositions and attitudes (91%). The assessment scale with the lowest percentage of children working securely within the early learning goals was: communication, language and literacy: writing (67%). The assessment scale with the highest percentage of children working towards (achieving a total of 1 to 3 points) the early learning goals was communication, language and literacy: writing (10%). The assessment scale with the lowest percentage of children achieving 1 to 3 points was personal social and emotional development: dispositions and attitudes (1% - table 1). The assessment scale with the highest percentage of children working beyond (9 points) the early learning goals was problem solving, reasoning and numeracy: numbers as labels and for counting (15%). The scales with the lowest percentage of children achieving 9 points are knowledge and understanding of the world and creative development with (3% - table 1). Girls continue to achieve at a higher level in all assessment scales compared to boys with the largest gap being in writing. The percentage of children achieving a good level of development in 2011 was 59% compared to 56% in 2010. Chris Noble 01325 735421 chris.noble@education.gsi.gov.uk"
/au-pairs-employment-law,"Au pairs Au pairs usually live with the family they work for and are unlikely to be classed as a worker or an employee. They aren’t entitled to the National Minimum Wage or paid holidays. They’re treated as a member of the family they live with and get ‘pocket money’ instead - usually about £70 to £85 a week. Au pairs may have to pay Income Tax and National Insurance , depending on how much pocket money they get. An au pair isn’t classed as a worker or an employee if most of the following apply: they’re a foreign national living with a family in the UK they’re an EU citizen or have entered the UK on a Youth Mobility visa or student visa they’re here on a cultural exchange programme they’ve got a signed letter of invitation from the host family that includes details of their stay, eg accommodation, living conditions, approximate working hours, free time, pocket money they learn about British culture from the host family and share their own culture with them they have their own private room in the house, provided free of charge they eat their main meals with the host family, free of charge they help with light housework and childcare for around 30 hours a week, including a couple of evenings babysitting they get reasonable pocket money they can attend English language classes at a local college in their spare time they’re allowed time to study and can practise their English with the host family they sometimes go on holiday with the host family and help look after the children they can travel home to see their family during the year Example Gina has come to the UK from France to learn English. She lives with her host family and takes part in family events like days out and holidays. She has her meals with the family and does light housework and childcare for about 5 hours a day. She babysits a couple of times a week. Gina has 2 free days every week. She studies English at a local college 2 afternoons a week. Last year she spent 3 weeks in France visiting her own family and also went on holiday with her host family. Gina isn’t a worker or an employee. She gets £75 a week pocket money and doesn’t pay tax or National Insurance. Find more information for au pairs and host families on the British Au Pair Agencies Association website. Overview You’re usually considered the employer of a nanny, housekeeper, gardener or anyone else who works in your home if both: you hire them they’re not self-employed or paid through an agency This means you have certain responsibilities, like meeting the employee’s rights and deducting the right tax. There are special rules for au pairs , who aren’t usually considered workers or employees. Carers and personal assistants You’re classed as an employer if you pay a carer or personal assistant directly, even if you get money from your local council (‘ direct payments ’) or the NHS to pay for them. Ask your local council about organisations that can help with your employer responsibilities, eg recruiting and paying your carer. Employees’ rights Anyone you employ must: have an employment contract be given payslips not work more than the maximum hours allowed per week be paid at least the National Minimum Wage If they meet the eligibility requirements, they’re also entitled to things like: Statutory Maternity Pay Statutory Sick Pay paid holiday redundancy pay a workplace pension Tax and employing people at home The employer must: check if the person can work in the UK have employer’s liability insurance register as an employer and set up and run payroll , or pay someone else to do it on their behalf (even if they pay the employee in cash ) The employer is responsible for: deducting and paying the employee’s Income Tax and National Insurance contributions paying statutory benefits, eg maternity pay and sick pay There are also rules around: paying for mileage if the employee uses their own car for work providing the employee with their own car ( including tax and insurance) Employers can’t ask their employees to become self-employed."
/government/speeches/edward-timpson-supporting-send-students-in-further-education,"Thank you Zoe [Hancock] - it is great to be with you all this morning. You’ll be pleased to hear that I won’t be talking about flood defences, or roads. Instead, I’ll be focusing on the most important challenge that we face - that is support for students with special educational needs and disabilities ( SEND ). It’s great to see a few familiar faces from the Lancaster House reception we held in September to celebrate the launch of the SEN and disability reforms. The approach we’ve taken has made a real difference, and it was excellent to look at the progress made to date as well as discuss the substantial amount of work that lies ahead with implementation. I also believe today will be my Association of Colleges ( AoC ) conference hat-trick - so apologies to those who turned up hoping to see me off the menu! But today is a chance to consider how far we’ve come over the past few years. When I spoke to you last December , the Children and Families Bill was about to be enshrined in law. I said to you we could rise to the challenge, and through endeavour, I want to make this vision a reality. So firstly a thank you for everything you’ve done to help us shape and improve these reforms, the biggest to special educational needs for 30 years. We made sure we consulted closely with the AoC and many others, and I hope you came away from that experience feeling that we listened to you. Not just in terms of the policy, but also the practicalities that if implemented will make a really positive impact to many children and families’ lives. Fast forward 12 months and we’re now moving into that all-important phase of delivering these reforms on the ground and ensuring they improve the prospects of some of our most vulnerable children and disadvantaged young people. Role of further education sector And I’m in no doubt that the FE sector has a pivotal role to play in bridging childhood and greater independence for hundreds of thousands of children. Your work is the culmination of efforts, from the early years onwards, to give young people the same support and opportunities as we want for our own children. These are essential ingredients in a successful transition into adulthood - having that clear sense of aspiration whatever their start in life. Yes, we want students with SEND to enjoy their course, make friends and feel safe in the college environment - but what about what happens next? What about their chances of getting a job, going on to further study, living independently? You help cross that divide between education and independence, something which seems like a simple step but often isn’t. Our reforms build on this vital role, giving you an even greater opportunity to make a difference. That’s why I’m pleased to see that - 3 months after these reforms kicked in - you’re seizing that opportunity with enthusiasm and ambition, as reflected in today’s attendance. According to a survey carried out jointly by the association and my department, there have been some really positive developments on the ground. The survey results Most of you have got buy-in from your management team, recruiting senior colleagues as SEND leads. 95% of respondents will be running tailored study programmes next year, matching their students’ strengths to a programme that suits their abilities. And more than three-quarters of colleges say they are working closely with their local authority to deliver the reforms, leading to some excellent practice. The Isle of Wight council, for example, asked their Young Inspectors to pull the EHC document apart to see if it’s up to scratch. One of the young inspectors noted that the font was too small for them - they couldn’t make sense of it. Another struggled with some of the language. This kind of feedback and approach could only come from involving students themselves - and it’s precisely that sort of input that our reforms aim to encourage. Input that focuses on what works and on those all-important outcomes. That’s heard and acted on by services across health, education and social care as they collaborate ever more closely. And that shapes support from birth to 25, ensuring that the help young people get is determined not by a birthday but by need. Students with SEND finding work I saw just how important that type of input is when I visited Moore Lane Integrated Centre in Kingston and Richmond a few weeks ago. I was struck - not only by the sheer amount of cake on offer - but also just how seriously the students took their involvement in the changes. They felt very empowered by the role they had to play. One of the students, Zakki, told me about his direct involvement in staff appointments. This not only helped him gain invaluable employment skills, but also inspired new teachers to better serve their SEN students. I was also really encouraged by what I saw just last week when I visited the first purpose-built college for students with learning difficulties at Barnet and Southgate Centre of Excellence. Their first-rate facilities are shaped and designed with students to maximise opportunity, inclusion and outcomes, as exemplified by the Steps to Work initiative which is helping students cross over into the world of work. Supported internships And this is an area where supported internships can really help and provide a valuable bridge into meaningful work - a world that can often be inaccessible and daunting, as we know, for young people with SEND . We can see just how well this is working at Trafford College in Manchester, where job coaches not only mentor students through their work placements but also mentor employers - many of whom have had little or no experience of working with people with learning difficulties. Placements have included Marks & Spencer and Premier Inn. One student landed what he described as his ‘dream job’. As a result, Trafford has achieved a fantastic 70% employment rate for those young people who have taken part in supported internships. As I’m sure all of you here will be aware, the employment rate for people with learning difficulties has been stubbornly low at around 7%. Trafford have improved on this 10 times over. Great news, but I want to hear about more SEND students finding their dream jobs, perhaps with some really big-name employers already involved with supported internships - which include National Grid and Transport for London. They’ve all set a great example, but I hope more businesses will get involved and discover for themselves just what students with SEND can and do contribute. Addressing challenges So there’s a lot of excellent practice that we can build on as we go forward. Yet these are big reforms and I recognise that it will take time for them to bed in. And that there will inevitably be challenges - some foreseen, some not - along the way. For instance, I know that there are some issues - ongoing - with funding, and also with the EHC process itself. Fortunately for you and for me, Peter [Mucklow] from the Education Funding Agency and Ann [Gross] from my department will be able to say more about this later today. But I am aware that some local authorities are passing down funding to help colleges with this issue, and this might be something for more of you to consider and for us to discuss. But whilst there will always be bumps along the way with change on this scale, let’s not forget the tremendous prospects we have here to transform SEND support and children and young people’s life chances. And, indeed, the survey results point to some really good progress. There’s, of course, more to do, particularly - as the survey highlighted - on a better exit strategy for young people with SEND as they leave college. So there are a number of things I’d urge you to consider as the reforms roll out more widely. Make sure that young people have all the information they need at their fingertips by ensuring you’re listed in the local offer, not just in your local area but the surrounding areas, too. If you haven’t already done so, find out how your college fits into your local authority’s transition plan. They all now have one, so make sure you have been carefully thought about as part of that. And encourage your students and families to take up personal budgets, to really shape their own future. Families have told us that the reforms are making their lives easier and much of this is down to the great work of your colleges. One parent I met a few weeks ago said that a review with her child’s tutor had a very different feel to it. She said that it was much more forward-looking and centred around their aspirations. That’s exactly what I want to hear. Conclusion So I urge you in everything you do to continue to push the boundaries and aim high on behalf of young people who have so much potential. You only need to look at the survey results to see how far the FE sector has come. And, to be blunt, we can’t do this without you. We’re breaking new ground, and by working together I’m hopeful we’re on our way to doing much better by some of our most vulnerable and most rewarding young people. All of us here can see their potential - now let’s help them take that to the world outside the college campus and show everyone what they can do. This will be a transition which will not take months, but years. Let us know about any teething issues you have, and we can help to solve them together. I look forward to working with you on this. Thank you."
/government/news/launch-of-national-college-for-teaching-and-leadership,"The National College for Teaching and Leadership is a single agency focused on promoting high-quality teaching and school leadership. Its remit will also include continuous professional and leadership development and supporting school improvement. The main driver behind the merger is to bring together the key building blocks for the creation of the school-led system. The new agency will build on the best from the Teaching Agency and National College and will work in new ways to support the school-led system. Education Secretary Michael Gove said: The creation of the National College for Teaching and Leadership brings together and builds on the excellent work led by the Teaching Agency and the National College. Importantly it will ensure that the best schools are at the heart of teacher training, professional development and school improvement. High-quality teaching and leadership are vital in raising standards in schools. Charlie Taylor, chief executive of the new agency, said: The merger of the National College and Teaching Agency makes perfect sense. This is an exciting opportunity, uniting the strengths of both. Together we will be better able to support the best schools, the best leaders and the best teachers as they lead the system. Notes to editors: The Teaching Agency is responsible for the recruitment, supply and initial training and development of teachers. It also supports the recruitment and development of early education and childcare workers, special educational needs coordinators and education psychologists, and oversees the regulation of the conduct of teachers. In addition, the exams delivery support unit supports exams officers and manages general qualifications logistics. The National College for School Leadership works to develop and support great leaders of schools and early years settings so that they can make a positive difference to children’s lives. This includes the development of a national network of Teaching Schools, designating National and Local Leaders of Education and the move to license school-led partnerships to offer leadership development and qualifications, including the National Professional Qualification for Headship. In total, 1,619 responded to the consultation on the new name of the agency. Seventy- four per cent of all survey respondents selected the ‘National College for Teaching and Leadership’ as the preferred name. [Contact:997]"
/government/speeches/sarah-teather-speaks-to-respublica-about-child-poverty,"It is a great pleasure to be here today to close this conference on child poverty. Thank you to Philip, Annalise and Respublica for inviting me. I sincerely apologise that I wasn’t able to hear the other sessions today. I understand from the programme you have been debating the relative contributions of income and early intervention to tackling child poverty. Sometimes people unhelpfully characterise these two as opposites. This government recognises that both are vital. That is why we are committed to the targets in the Child Poverty Act, including the relative, absolute and persistent measures. We recognise the challenge of meeting those targets and differ with the previous government on the best means of achieving that, which I shall speak about in a minute. But those who suggest income plays no part in child poverty are wrong. Anyone who doubts that income matters should try living without income and see whether that changes their views. This is why, despite the challenging financial circumstances the government is nevertheless up-rating most benefits by CPI - which is 5.2 per cent. It is also why we are increasing personal tax allowance to help those who earn least. And why I, as a Liberal Democrat Minister in the Coalition Government, want to see that process happen faster to help those in work who are still struggling. It is also why so much of the government’s effort has been focused on getting people back into work. Making sure we support people properly who have been out of work for some time to get back into work, or on the route to work. And trying to remove the disincentives in the system that trap people in a cycle of benefits. This is the whole point behind universal credit - a simpler system that fits around people’s lives as they change, trying to take out the risks that people face at the moment as they move into work by making sure they are better off in work. And that simpler system will lead to a higher take-up of benefits for those who qualify but who don’t currently claim, lifting around 300, 000 children out of poverty. But although adequate income is a necessary pre-condition for a child meeting their potential, it is not sufficient. Other things also hold them back. The complex causes and consequences of poverty cannot be tackled by income transfers alone. This is most clearly evident in educational attainment. The gaps in achievement between the poorest and the wealthiest are stark. The greatest predictor of a child’s achievement is the income of its parents and the greatest predictor of future income is a child’s attainment at school - so we have a society that entrenches disadvantage. But what is perhaps starker is that it doesn’t have to be that way. We have come to expect that poverty will always go hand in hand with poor attainment, but in other countries it does not necessarily follow. Something about the way our society is structured, the way our educational system works, locks that underachievement in, passing from one generation to the next. Our children are less resilient to the effects of poverty than those in other countries. This is why we need to do better at tackling problems early, and intervening. The evidence says that three things in the foundation years are critical for defining future outcomes: maternal health; home learning environment; quality of early years education. This is why Government is investing in more family nurse partnerships and health visitors. Why we are beginning trials of universal parenting classes in three areas. Why we are asking children’s centres to do better at identifying and supporting the neediest families - this is the reason why we have published a new core purpose for children’s centres and are beginning payment by results. In the early years all our effort is also currently focused on quality. We have a new foundation stage curriculum with more emphasis on child development and better communication with parents. We have commissioned a review of the Early Years workforce being undertaken by Professor Cathy Nutbrown and we are consulting on a new basket of measures of quality. Of course none of this matters when those who most need it don’t get a chance to benefit. Very few two-year-olds from poorer backgrounds get any chance to access early education at the moment. So we are delivering a huge expansion in investment in free early education - we will be extending the free entitlement of 15 hours to 20 per cent of two-year-olds in 2013 expanding to 40 per cent in 2014. Making sure that the children who most need high quality early education get a chance to access it. We are investing £760 million in this, despite the financial difficulties - demonstrating the priority this government attaches to the foundation years. As children move from Early Years to school, we want schools to do more on helping those from poorer backgrounds, not just to reach the average, but to excel. With the Pupil Premium we have invested £1.25 billion extra to help the most disadvantaged pupils. We are asking schools to publish how they are spending it. We have already published how children are performing at Key Stage 2 and Key Stage 3. And Ofsted are looking at how they will hold schools to account. So Government is playing its part in tackling child poverty and making this a priority. But poverty is experienced differently in different areas which is why what local authorities do is so vital. The Child Poverty Act set out the important role that local authorities have in this area and I have been able to see how they have been rising to that challenge - developing new schemes, new ways of working to tackle local problems. Great ideas like Tyne Gateway’s innovative scheme of family entrepreneurs, employing parents to reach out to other parents. Or Reading Council’s use of parents as volunteers in early years - working as peer mentors. Councils are developing local solutions, tailored to meet local need. The point about peer mentor programmes and similar schemes is the way in which they breed a kind of solidarity between people, often people from different backgrounds, who have shared similar experiences but who may now be in different places in their lives. Schemes like these work because of the basic human connection and relationships they foster - relationships that give a sense of hope about future possibilities. It seems to me that part of the problem with the way the debate about poverty is characterised in the press is that far from supporting and fostering any kind of solidarity, it more often drives a fissure through existing societal divides. Making those gaps between people wider, even through language, puts certain groups outside society and makes it harder for them to exercise citizenship, harder for them to advocate on their own behalf, harder for them to help themselves. Setting up two opposing groups is of course a classic rhetorical device; Romeo and Juliet; David and Goliath; or in this case the deserving and undeserving poor. But it is language we should all take care not to use. Because such divisions put our goal of ending child poverty further away from us not closer. If we are going to succeed in making a lasting impact on child poverty, we are going to need to harness the energy of all. Government will play its part in the areas where only it can act and will make it a priority. But we will need the ideas and the skill of the voluntary and community sectors, the energy of business, the local knowledge of local authorities and health service professionals, and the commitment of everyone in this room to hold us to account."
/government/news/englands-15-year-olds-reading-over-a-year-behind-the-worlds-best,"GCSE pupils’ reading is more than a year behind the standard of their peers in Shanghai, Korea and Finland, research reveals today. Fifteen-year-olds in England are also at least six months behind those in Hong Kong, Singapore, Canada, New Zealand, Japan and Australia, according to the Department for Education’s (DfE) analysis of the OECD’s 2009 Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) study. To match the attainment of pupils from Shanghai in the reading assessment: The proportion of England’s pupils achieving five A*-C grades (including English and maths) at the end of Key Stage 4 would need to increase by 22 percentage points. For all maintained schools in England this would be an increase from 55 per cent of pupils achieving the threshold measure (in 2010) to 77 per cent. The DfE’s PISA 2009 Study: How Big is the Gap? highlights how far England has slipped behind other nations in reading. Schools Minister Nick Gibb said that the Government was taking urgent action to ensure England could match those countries which had closed the gap between the achievements of rich and poor pupils, while raising the attainment of all. He said: The gulf between our 15-year-olds’ reading abilities and those from other countries is stark - a gap that starts to open in the very first few years of a child’s education. The Government’s focus on raising standards of reading in the early years of primary school is key to closing that gap. We are introducing a phonics check for six-year-olds, so those with reading problems can be identified before it is too late and can be given the extra help they need to catch up. Having learnt to read, they can then go on to read to learn, and to read for pleasure. Almost 40 per cent of pupils in England never read for enjoyment. The difference in reading ability between these pupils and those who read for just half an hour a day is equivalent to a year’s schooling at age 15. We are also bringing in a new spelling, punctuation, grammar and vocabulary test for 11-year-olds and are re-introducing marks for spelling, punctuation and grammar in relevant GCSE exams. Nick Gibb added: Our writers - Charles Dickens and Charlotte Bronte, George Orwell and Ian McEwan - are the finest in the world. It is time we are also among the best readers in the world. The DfE analysis also calculates the reading gap in terms of GCSE grades. It puts Shanghai’s 15-year-olds the equivalent of 11 GCSE grades ahead of our pupils, while Korea’s are eight grades better off. Those in Finland and Hong Kong are seven grades ahead. This means that while a typical pupil at the end of Key Stage 4 in England achieves eight C grades in their best eight GCSEs or equivalent exams, one in Shanghai would score three As and five Bs in their best eight GCSEs - a total of 11 grades better off. Attainment gap between England and the countries performing significantly better than England in the PISA 2009 reading assessment expressed using various measures of attainment.   Reading strand   Difference in pupil attainment…  Comparison Country 1 …in GCSE grades …in % pupils achieving 5 A*-C (inc.

The studies in 2000, 2003 and 2006 focused on reading, maths and science respectively. The 2009 study returned to reading as the main focus but also looked at maths and science. In the former, 20 countries scored significantly higher than England, with Shanghai top. England was also out-scored by Estonia, Iceland, Denmark and Slovenia. In science, Shanghai again leads the rankings. Estonia and Australia are among the nine other countries significantly ahead of England’s 15-year-olds. Across all three strands, England has tumbled down the international tables in the last nine years - from 7th to 25th in reading; 8th to 28th in maths; and 4th to 16th in science. The research shows that high-performing nations have the following in common. They: recruit and develop excellent teachers allow greater freedoms for schools and leaders have clear standards, high expectations, and external exams have effective identification and sharing of best practice have clear, transparent and proportionate assessment and accountability systems. Notes to editors The DfE analysis of the OECD PISA 2009 study can be found in the publications section of our website. The full OECD PISA 2009 study , including a UK note, can be found on the OECD website. OECD PISA has taken place every three years since 2000. It assesses the knowledge and skills of pupils coming towards the end of compulsory schooling (Year 11 equivalent) in reading, mathematics and science, using specially developed tests. Participating pupils also complete a background questionnaire which yields data about their socio-economic background, study habits and attitudes to reading, while headteachers complete a questionnaire about their schools. PISA 2009 focused on reading. The study was carried out in England on behalf of the Department by the National Foundation for Educational Research (NFER). A total of 4,081 pupils across 165 schools in England participated, including independent schools and academies in proportion to their numbers nationally. PISA splits China into different jurisdictions - Shanghai-China and Hong Kong-China. [Contact:997] Website: www.education.gov.uk/help/contactus"

/government/news/new-early-years-framework-published,"A slimmed down and more focused Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) for children aged from birth to 5-year-olds was today published by Children’s Minister Sarah Teather. The new EYFS, which will take effect from 1 September 2012, focuses on getting children ready for education and increasing the attainment of all children, particularly those from deprived backgrounds. The government also today pledges to go further. Where there are examples of regulation and paperwork that are not necessary to safeguard children, drive up quality or promote child development, they will be removed. The revised curriculum reduces the number of early learning goals from 69 to 17, gives more focus to the main areas of learning that are most essential for children’s healthy development and simplifies assessment at age 5. It also provides earlier intervention for children who need extra help with a progress check at age 2. The government has reduced paperwork for professionals to allow them to exercise their judgement, for example by removing the requirement for written risk assessments for all activities. Children’s Minister Sarah Teather said: What really matters is making sure a child is able to start school ready to learn, able to make friends and play, ready to ask for what they need and say what they think. These are critical foundations for really getting the best out of school. It’s vital we have the right framework to support high quality early years education. Our changes, including the progress check at age 2, will support early years professionals and families to give children the best possible start in life. People working in the early years, teachers, parents, and other professionals support our proposals, which keep the best of the existing framework but slim it down. This is the first part of our reforms to the early years. Where we find examples of regulation and paperwork that are not necessary to safeguard children, drive up quality or promote child development, we will remove them. We will continue to help practitioners to focus on children’s healthy development. The reformed EYFS builds on the independent advice of Dame Clare Tickell. Dame Clare Tickell said: I am very happy to endorse the new EYFS. It closely follows my recommendations, building on the strengths of the current framework and making key improvements in response to the concerns of many people working in the sector. There is a compelling reason for reforming the EYFS while retaining its overall shape and scope: the evidence is clear that there is a strong positive link between high quality early education and children’s healthy progress through school and into adulthood. To secure that link, and to ensure that all children grow-up healthy, safe, and resilient, and develop the ability and curiosity to learn, we need the EYFS. Together with a more flexible free early education entitlement and new streamlined inspection arrangements, the new framework is an integral part of the government’s wider vision to free professionals to focus on their interaction with children. Last summer, the government asked Professor Cathy Nutbrown to consider how we might strengthen the early years workforce. Her report is due in June, and the government will carefully consider her recommendations - along with international evidence on staffing levels and qualifications - as we continue to promote early years provision that is high quality and cost effective to parents. People working in the early years will get additional guidance and information so they feel confident to deliver the new EYFS. And a summary of the EYFS will be available for parents so they know what their child will be learning and what they should expect from their child’s early years setting. The coalition government is committed to investing in the early years and is expanding free childcare to many 2-year-olds as well as all 3- and 4-year-olds. The new EYFS will ensure that good quality early learning benefits all children, as the government believes this can make a real difference to success in later life. Notes to editors Revised EYFS framework . The EYFS has been statutory since 2008 and sets standards in learning and welfare for any provider caring for children aged from birth to 5 years old. The framework was introduced in response to research that highlighted how good quality childcare can support children’s learning and development. The new framework will place a stronger focus on three prime areas of learning - communication and language, physical development, and personal, social and emotional development - which are critical for the development of the very youngest children and are fundamental to more structured learning as they get older.

There have been a number of policy strategies and initiatives since the late 1990s aiming to change this situation and to enable more children, and disadvantaged children in particular, to participate in early years education. This study aims to analyse how the take-up of early years provision varies by different dimensions of disadvantage and the main barriers experienced by disadvantaged families.

/government/news/parents-to-have-more-choice-of-high-quality-childcare,"Parents will have more choice of high-quality childcare, the government outlined today in its new report ‘More great childcare’. The current system doesn’t work. We have a poorly-paid and poorly-qualified early years workforce with many not having a grade C in GCSE English and maths. That’s why today’s childcare reforms will ensure that we overhaul childcare qualifications, and provide more choice of quality education and care for parents. European countries, such as France and Denmark, recognise that looking after children is an extremely important job - and that attitude is reflected in higher levels of skills and pay. In contrast, Professor Cathy Nutbrown said in her review of childcare qualifications, about England: Too many people who work with young children are under-qualified and the system for qualifications is confusing and inadequate. This cannot continue if we are expected to compete in a global market and we want to provide children with a complete and fulfilled education. The first step in doing this is to make sure qualifications for the early years workforce are rigorous and more demanding. Secondly, we propose to allow nurseries to relax ratios only where they hire highly-qualified staff. Nurseries without highly-qualified staff will need to stick to existing ratios. Thirdly, we will set up childminding agencies who will offer a one-stop shop service for childminders - taking care of business practicalities, and quality assurance for parents. Fourth, Ofsted will be the only arbiter of quality, reducing the burden on LAs from doing their own inspections and saving them money so more can go to the frontline. Fifth, by abolishing the requirement on schools to register separately with Ofsted if they want to provide care and education for children under the age of 3 - we will make it easier for more schools to offer childcare and early education. Education and Childcare Minister Elizabeth Truss said: It is right that the government does everything it can to ensure the provision delivering early education is of the highest quality, staff are paid better, and childcare is affordable to parents. When parents hand their child over to the care of a childminder or nursery they are not just entrusting them with their child’s physical safety; they are also entrusting their child’s brain. With this in mind it is no longer acceptable that childcare professionals are not required to have a GCSE grade C or above in English and maths. Parents want a choice of quality home-based care, quality nursery care or a combination of both. Our proposals for overhauling childcare qualifications, having early years teachers, and child-minding agencies, underpinned by a robust inspection regime, will provide this. At the moment, many nursery and private, voluntary and independent settings do not use full ratios. We think teacher-led settings with full ratios and structured activities are a good thing. Ofsted will favour this too. We do not mean to stipulate how all settings should behave, but we want parents to have the choice.

In France, they can look after four under-5s. In England, they can only look after 3.

Far from it. Instead, it would allow them to exercise their professional judgement, giving them more options over how they operate. Ros Marshall, from kidsunlimited said: As a leading nursery operator in the UK, kidsunlimited broadly welcomes the focus and changes that the government is proposing in relation to nursery care provision. Early years learning is a crucial stage of a child’s development and the increased recognition of its importance will benefit children and families, while the focus on qualifications will help staff in the sector gain the status and recognition that their hard work deserves. Relaxing staff ratios will ultimately offer nurseries a degree of flexibility to focus on the best-qualified staff and highest standards of care for children and the introduction of childminder agencies will help those sole practitioners who operate to a high standard get the support network they need to thrive and reduce costly registration practices. Anne Longfield, Chief Executive of 4Children, said: Parents throughout the country agree with government that ‘more great childcare’ is needed. We know that the shortage of affordable and accessible childcare is the biggest barrier to parents returning to work and holding down their job. Parents also agree that childcare needs to be the highest quality. Parents need the peace of mind that their children are being well looked after by well-trained and qualified staff. 4Children welcomes the further consultations that will follow today’s launch which offer childcare experts and parents alike an opportunity to have their say on this important subject. These are complex issues and it is vital that we take the time to get it right. It is crucial that any changes that are made reduce inequality between young children from disadvantaged families and their better-off peers and we will work with government to realise that ambition. The government’s plans to improve the quality and qualifications of staff are very welcome and offer an opportunity to look again at how childcare is organised and staffed. The welfare of the child must be our first concern throughout but with highly-qualified early years teachers and a better inspection regime, there is an opportunity to review current arrangements and provide simpler information for parents and better incentives for providers to concentrate on what matters - children. Ben Black, Director of My Family Care, said: As someone who employs 200 people across various childcare businesses, I feel passionately about the issues and about the changes proposed by the government. Childcare in the UK is very heavily subsidised, ultimately by us taxpayers, in various over-complicated ways. And yet it remains expensive and unaffordable for many. We all know that nursery staff, given the responsibilities they have and jobs they do, are underpaid. Looking at ratios, and in some cases daring to suggest that they be relaxed, isn’t only sensible; it’s essential. The quality of nursery workers is the most important consideration for parents by a distance and there’s an obvious link between ratios, how much nursery owners can afford to pay and how many good childcarers are lost to the industry every year to marginally better-paying jobs. It’s a tragedy. From my position as a parent and a provider giving nurseries a bit more leeway on ratios is absolutely the right approach. Ultimately that will lead to better paid jobs, better quality and more affordable childcare. The government will report shortly on care for school age children, informal childcare and the funding regime. The childcare commission, which is looking at affordability and accessibility, will report soon. Notes to editors More great childcare - Raising quality and giving parents more choice can be found on the Department’s website. Childminders look after children aged under 5 in their own home while their parents are at work or studying. They are registered with and inspected by Ofsted. Early education is provided in an independent setting like a nursery, or be part of a school or children’s centre. Nursery teachers work with children aged three to five in nursery schools or classes. They plan, organise and run a wide range of indoor and outdoor activities for them. Staff salaries and staff:child ratios in several European countries are outlined below. Sources are detailed in More great childcare. The government has today announced the ‘Focus on enforcement’ review of how regulation for childcare providers is enforced by national regulators and councils. Parents, childcare providers, nurseries and pre-schools are invited to provide examples of how enforcement could be improved. They are also asked to highlight where regulation is working well, so that good practice can be replicated across the sector. The review is available at ‘Focus on enforcement’ .

It is clear from the report that the government has the same view. We are encouraged that they see the impact high-quality nursery education and childcare has on children and their development, and we believe the sector will welcome and embrace more flexibility which can be used as they feel appropriate in their individual settings. As we at Busy Bees continue to develop a national network of local nurseries, we agree that increased flexibility for providers will give more opportunity to deliver higher quality places and parental choice, and this should mean that women in particular feel more confident about returning to work. We welcome initiatives that find ways of improving the quality of care and education provision in the UK, and the ways of making this provision affordable for every family. It was the lack of choice and flexibility in the sector 30 years ago that led us to sell our own homes to fund our own nursery so that we could provide the quality of childcare we needed as working parents. In our aim to make this quality childcare more affordable for working families we introduced the childcare voucher system at Busy Bees. In our opinion the childcare voucher system is the most effective way of helping working parents save money. Some of the suggestions of making changes to ratios may work in some settings (although we will always protect our quality provision) but in reality this will only be a saving of around £3.50 a week per family who use full-time childcare. However, by raising the cap from £55 to £75 (as our campaign ‘Mind the Gap - Raise the Cap’ instigated last year) it could mean a saving of approximately £49 a week - based on 2 working parents - which would be a considerable financial benefit for our working families. Busy Bees also supports the concept of enhancing the status of childcare workers and their continuous professional development, and has a comprehensive in-house training programme thanks to funding obtained by the SFA. Within our 213 settings we have many fabulous practitioners, many of whom have the desired grade C, and we support our staff to enhance their numeracy and literacy skills across the board. Credit must be given to the staff working within good and outstanding nurseries across the UK. We thank them for delivering great care and urge that we all look to them for practical and educational guidance as we implement areas of change. Over the last 10 years we’ve had the benefit of looking at childcare provision around the world, and have seen for ourselves that quality childcare and early provision can be delivered in a range of styles reflecting local communities and differing cultures. It is essential that we (government, local authorities, childcare providers and schools) come together as one body, and combine innovation with ‘hands-on’ experience in order to manage the implementation of any changes that have been outlined in the report. This sector is accustomed to change, and we at Busy Bees believe that by embracing the numerous changes over the last 30 years, we have evolved into a sustainable business with the ability to attract and retain exceptional staff, and provide the very best in childcare. We welcome the report and the discussions it will raise.

/government/speeches/schools-minister-nick-gibb-to-the-2011-hmc-deputy-heads-conference,"I’m absolutely delighted to be here today and I’m grateful to you for inviting me. First, because we have much in common. As Minister of State, rather than Secretary of State, I too am a fully paid up member of the ‘deputy club’. And secondly, because I’m a huge admirer of what the independent sector has achieved. While the state sector has, over the last half century, fallen victim to the vicissitudes of passing educational fads and ideology, the independent sector has remained steadfast to high quality, well-rounded education based on clear evidence of what works best for children and young people. HMC schools don’t just set the benchmark for every other school in this country, private or state, to aspire to. Their excellence is recognised all over the world. And as I saw on a visit to King Edward’s School in Birmingham in January, that success is rooted in independence, freedom and autonomy. The independence to develop strong teaching and curricula which maintains academic rigour across the board. To adopt high quality, internationally recognised qualifications like the IB or the iGCSE. And to use outstanding artistic, sporting and pastoral provision, to create broad-minded young people, ready to thrive in an ever-changing world. Our reform programme is based on the same principles of independence - that teachers and professionals know best how to run schools. Everything we’re doing is about giving the best state schools the same autonomy to get on with the job - without Whitehall dictating day-to-day details. And so today, I also want to set out how the independent sector and its leadership teams can play a part in raising standards across our education system. Unashamedly, we want to replicate the best of what the independent sector does - learning and applying the lessons from its success. But to do that properly, we need to draw directly on the excellence, ethos, and proven track record - what my predecessor, Lord Adonis, called the “educational DNA” of the independent sector. I was pleased to see that that the title of this conference - Meeting the Challenges - suggests independent schools are not resting on their laurels. Because the education system is facing some of its toughest challenges in decades. How do we meet the demands of business, universities and society to compete in a fast-changing, unpredictable global economy? How do we use early years’ provision and schools to drive social mobility? How do we drive up standards in the state system in the face of tighter public spending? Our White Paper last November, The Importance of Teaching, pointed out that there is much to admire and build on in England’s state education system: hundreds of outstanding schools; tens of thousands of great teachers; academies established and outstripping the rest of the maintained sector. But it was also made clear that too many children are still being let down because the system is not fulfilling its potential. We’re failing to keep pace with countries with the best education systems - falling back in the PISA international rankings, from fourth to sixteenth in science; seventh to 25th in literacy; and eighth to 28th in maths - meaning our 15-year-olds are two years behind their Chinese peers in maths; and a year behind teenagers in Korea or Finland in reading. We’re still not meeting the expectations of employers - with the CBI’s annual education and skills survey just last month finding that almost half of top employers had to invest in remedial training for school and college leavers. And we’ve still not closed the yawning attainment gap - which remains unacceptably wide both between rich and poor and between state and private sectors. Professor William Richardson’s excellent report for the HMC 18 months ago, showed the top ten universities’ increasing reliance on the independent sector - with 40% of all students on strategically important courses like engineering, science, maths and languages, drawn from private schools. And last year’s A-level results also showed a fifth of all entrants in chemistry, physics, maths and biological sciences and almost a third in further maths were independent school pupils. But as a nation, we can’t carry on relying on the seven per cent of young people the independent sector educates, to provide such a high proportion of future generations of scientists, engineers, medics or linguists. The key to both social mobility and a mobile economy is to realise the potential, ability and talent of young people from all backgrounds. That’s why we’ve introduced the English Baccalaureate. The Russell Group has been quite clear about the core GCSE and A-level subjects which equips students best for the most competitive courses - English; maths; the three sciences; geography; history; classical and modern languages. So the E-Bacc is designed to open up those same subjects to tens of thousands of state pupils currently denied the opportunity. We need to take clear action. It is a major concern to us that nine out of ten state pupils eligible for free school meals are not even entered for the E-Bacc subjects - and just 4% actually achieve it. It is a concern that the proportion taking a modern foreign language GCSE has slipped from 79% a decade ago to just 43% last year - and little more than a third when you take out independent schools. And it cannot be right that no pupil was entered for any of the single award science GCSEs in 719 mainstream state schools; for French in 169; for geography in 137; and for history in 70. The most academic subjects must not become the preserve of independent schools. They should be open to every single student, regardless of background. In the modern world, there is nowhere to hide for any school leaver. Jobs can be transported across international borders in a nanosecond. The pace of technological change means that new industries are evolving in the space of months not decades. So it is no longer good enough to judge state education simply by how much we spend or against rigid, centrally arbitrated targets - we need to raise our game. Our reform programme draws on the clear and consistent evidence base from the leading education systems around the world. PISA, OECD, McKinsey and others tell us that despite most developed countries doubling or even tripling their education spending since the mid-1970s, outcomes have varied wildly. Because it is not how much they’ve spent on education that counts most. It is how they spent it. The strongest systems recruit and develop the best teachers. They have strong leadership. They have internationally benchmarked curricula, assessments and qualifications. And above all, they give schools and professionals freedom to flourish. That’s why we are getting rid of much unnecessary, cumbersome bureaucracy that bedevils state schools - slimming down the National Curriculum; scrapping the Self Evaluation Form; focusing Ofsted inspections on teaching; closing down quangos; and cutting the overly complex Admissions Code and hundreds of pages of statutory guidance. But we want to go further. We want to complete the last government’s unfinished business when it comes to academies. We’ve enabled every single state primary, secondary and special school to become independent, autonomous institutions. Free to decide how to use their budgets. Free to vary pay and conditions. Free to decide the length of the school day. Free to offer qualifications in their pupils’ best interests. Academies have already proved a force for good in turning around underperforming schools in some of the most deprived areas. Mossbourne in Hackney; the Harris chain across south London and Burlington Danes in Hammersmith are now watchwords for the best of what the state sector can achieve. Just as your success is rooted in independence, the evidence is emerging that these early academies’ independence has driven up standards in neighbouring state schools - as new research from the LSE showed last month. We’re allowing good state schools to convert to academy status and the demand to do so has far exceeded our expectations. It took five years to open 15 City Technology Colleges and four years to open the first 27 Academies. But 1244 schools have applied to become an academy in the last 12 months and 430 have already converted - a rate of more than two every school day. A third of all secondary schools are either now academies or in the process of converting. And hundreds more are in the pipeline. This is a fundamental shift away from government and towards teachers and professionals. Academies are now reforming in ways never foreseen when the programme started a decade ago: • established multi-academy chains like Harris and ARK are raising standards in areas failed educationally for generations. • the first special schools are going through the application process. • the first generation of specialist technical academies are now opening - offering high-quality, work-based vocational education. • the door is now open to Further Education and Sixth Form Colleges and alternative provision to become academies through the current Education Bill before Parliament. • the first free schools are now set to open from September - and hundreds more coming through. Independent schools have already played an important part - acting as lead academy sponsors like Dulwich, Wellington and Canford; co-sponsoring like Marlborough, King Edward School, Bryanson and Tonbridge; or being active educational partners like Malvern, Winchester, Uppingham and Oundle. Organisations like ULT, Girls’ Day School Trust, Haberdashers’, Woodard Schools and the Skinner’s Company oversee joint families of academies and independent schools. And some have actually converted to the state sector like Birkenhead High School; William Hulme’s Grammar School; Belvedere Girls’ School; and Bristol Cathedral Choir School. But as the brakes come off the programme, scores more opportunities are opening up for the independent sector; HE and FE; charities; and business to play a greater role. Because crucially, we haven’t forgotten the programme’s roots - to turn round our most challenging, underperforming schools. Children only get one shot at education. So we’re clear that we will not hesitate to intervene in weak schools which are letting down parents and pupils. And that’s why we’ve appointed Dr Liz Sidwell, the Chief Executive of Haberdashers’ Aske’s Federation, as our new Schools Commissioner. Few in education have her track record or experience. And she hasn’t been shy in challenging local authorities and heads to come up with robust improvement plans - brokering academy arrangements; recruiting sponsors; enthusing heads and governors to go for academy status; promoting free schools to prospective proposers; and expanding our existing pool of sponsors significantly. Many schools in the independent sector have already established successful partnerships with neighbouring institutions through the Independent State School Partnership scheme. And we want that sort of collaboration to continue through the new national network of Teaching Schools; our Education Endowment Fund; and the National and Local Leaders of Education programme. But I believe that formally sponsoring, founding or partnering an academy must be the next logical step for many more independent and state schools. Because as academies become the norm in every single part of the system, how the best institutions are judged in the public’s eyes will also change. We have a clear expectation that the strongest state schools converting to academies should partner the weakest. And I hope that same expectation can apply in the independent sector too. Providing an opportunity for the sector to spread its unique ethos, culture and thinking to tens of thousands more children whose parents can’t afford school fees. Concepts like Brighton College’s plans for a consortium of independent and state schools to establish a sixth form college in East London to get gifted students to top universities. I know some schools have been hesitant to come forward. I understand those who may feel that the independent sector has enough on its plate - with many parents fighting hard to afford fees and many smaller schools striving to keep their heads above water in the current economic climate. But many independent schools were born out of a moral drive to help the poorest. That same moral purpose underpins our reforms - to give every single child, of whatever background, the opportunity to make the most of their talents. Mr Chairman, in the 12 months that I’ve had the privilege to hold the position of Minister of State for Schools I have done all I can to reduce regulation on the independent sector and I hope we can go further still. We’ve recognised the iGCSE in the performance tables - including from this year the Edexcel iGCSE - and we’ve made our admiration for what the sector has achieved clear at every opportunity. We all have the same goals when it comes to raising standards throughout the education system and I look forward to continuing to work with HMC and the independent sector to help achieve those goals. Thank you."
/children-with-special-educational-needs,"Overview Special educational needs and disabilities ( SEND ) can affect a child or young person’s ability to learn. They can affect their: behaviour or ability to socialise, eg they struggle to make friends reading and writing, eg because they have dyslexia ability to understand things concentration levels, eg because they have ADHD physical ability Who to talk to If you think your child may have special educational needs, contact the SEN co-ordinator, or ‘ SENCO ’ in your child’s school or nursery. Contact your local council if your child isn’t in a school or nursery. Your local Information, Advice and Support (IAS) Service can give you advice about SEND . Support your child can receive Your child may be eligible for: SEN support - support given in school, eg speech therapy an education, health and care ( EHC ) plan - a plan of care for children and young people aged up to 25 who have more complex needs If you or your child got support before September 2014 this will continue until your local council changes it to an EHC plan. Extra help An education, health and care ( EHC ) plan is for children and young people aged up to 25 who need more support than is available through special educational needs support. EHC plans identify educational, health and social needs and set out the additional support to meet those needs. Requesting an EHC assessment You can ask your local authority to carry out an assessment if you think your child needs an EHC plan. A young person can request an assessment themselves if they’re aged 16 to 25. A request can also be made by anyone else who thinks an assessment may be necessary, including doctors, health visitors, teachers, parents and family friends. If they decide to carry out an assessment you may be asked for: any reports from your child’s school, nursery or childminder doctors’ assessments of your child a letter from you about your child’s needs The local authority will tell you within 16 weeks whether an EHC plan is going to be made for your child. Creating an EHC plan Your local authority will create a draft EHC plan and send you a copy. You have 15 days to comment, including if you want to ask that your child goes to a specialist needs school or specialist college. Your local authority has 20 weeks from the date of the assessment to give you the final EHC plan. Disagreeing with a decision You can challenge your local authority about: their decision to not carry out an assessment their decision to not create an EHC plan the special educational support in the EHC plan the school named in the EHC plan If you can’t resolve the problem with your local authority, you can appeal to the Special Educational Needs and Disability (SEND) Tribunal . Personal budgets You may be able to get a personal budget for your child if they have an EHC plan or have been told that they need one. It allows you to have a say in how to spend the money on support for your child. There are 3 ways you can use your personal budget. You can have: direct payments made into your account - you buy and manage services yourself an arrangement with your local authority or school where they hold the money for you but you still decide how to spend it (sometimes called ‘notional arrangements’) third-party arrangements - you choose someone else to manage the money for you You can have a combination of all 3 options. Independent support for children of all ages Independent supporters can help you and your child through the new SEN assessment process, including: replacing a statement of special educational needs with a new EHC plan moving a child from a learning difficulty assessment ( LDA ) to an EHC plan You can find out how to get local support through: Council for Disabled Children Information, Advice and Support Service Network your local authority website and search for ‘Local Offer’ Special educational needs support Your child will get SEN support at their school or college. Your child may need an education, health and care ( EHC ) plan if they need more support than their school provides. Children under 5 SEN support for children under 5 includes: a written progress check when your child is 2 years old a child health visitor carrying out a health check for your child if they’re aged 2 to 3 a written assessment in the summer term of your child’s first year of primary school making reasonable adjustments for disabled children, eg providing aids like tactile signs Nurseries, playgroups and childminders registered with Ofsted follow the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) framework. The framework makes sure that there’s support in place for children with SEND . Talk to a doctor or health adviser if you think your child has SEND but they don’t go to a nursery, playgroup or childminder. They’ll tell you what support options are available. Children between 5 and 15 Talk to the teacher or the SEN co-ordinator (SENCO) if you think your child needs: a special learning programme extra help from a teacher or assistant to work in a smaller group observation in class or at break      help taking part in class activities extra encouragement in their learning, eg to ask questions or to try something they find difficult help communicating with other children support with physical or personal care difficulties, eg eating, getting around school safely or using the toilet Young people aged 16 or over in further education Contact the college before your child starts further education to make sure that they can meet your child’s needs. The college and your local authority will talk to your child about the support they need. If your child got support before September 2014 Your child will move to an education, health and care ( EHC ) plan by: September 2016 if they have a learning difficulty assessment ( LDA ) spring 2018 if they have a statement This will normally happen at a planned review, or when your child moves school. Your council will tell you which. Your child will already be getting SEN support if they used to get help through: School Action or School Action Plus Early Years Action or Early Years Action Plus Support after your child leaves school If your child has a statement of special educational needs, they’ll have a ‘transition plan’ drawn up in Year 9. This helps to plan for their future after they leave school. They’ll continue to get support during further education. Your child can also ask for an EHC assessment if they need more help than the school or college can provide. Help and advice You can call the Contact a Family helpline for help and advice.

/government/speeches/sarah-teather-to-the-family-and-parenting-institutes-conference,"Thanks Mark for that introduction and thanks to the FPI for inviting me along this morning. And thanks Mark for reminding us that families come in all shapes and sizes and Government absolutely has to take account of that. And it’s wonderful to see this event so full, with so many people from across the sector. I’d also like to say, that it was a pleasure to meet Dr Katherine [Rake] recently. While in opposition, I had great admiration for her in her time at the Fawcett Society, and she has brought the same energy to families. And I’d also like to pay tribute to the Family and Parenting Institute. For ten years now, by spreading effective practice and through managing the Parenting Fund, you’ve supported hundreds of voluntary sector organisations and tens of thousands of practitioners. And you’ve enabled them to deliver help that’s made a real difference to parents and families across the country. And of course, to all those other organisations here today - who provide vital support to our parents, grandparents, and children - to our babies, toddlers and teenagers - and to the most vulnerable in our society. I am truly honoured to be able to work alongside all of you. And I hope that in the months and years ahead, we can make a positive difference for some of the great challenges this country faces. And let me assure you, from the outset, that the renaming of our Department does not represent a shift in priority away from working with you and away from our children or families - in fact, in many ways, family policy has taken on greater priority in Government because of the Prime Minister’s Task Force, which I’ll speak more about later. And it’s so important because we all know the scale of the challenge we face. Despite the best intentions of the previous Government, and despite all the hard work that you, and frontline staff up and down the country do every day, our society is still deeply unfair. A fairer society In this country, over two million children live in poor housing, in crowded rooms and squalid conditions. Out of every five children, one is living in poverty. Just 21 per cent of children in care achieve 5 or more A to C grades at GCSE - compared to an average of 70 per cent. And, young people from poorer backgrounds are less than twice as likely to go to university than those from richer backgrounds. I see it for myself in my own constituency, just a few tube stops away in North London, where the consequences of that inequality, with wealthy and poor families living in the same area. I’ve seen how some families have struggled to cope with the recession, and the rising anxieties about young people and their future. And it is absolutely unacceptable that a child from Harlesden, in my constituency, is expected to die more than ten years before one born in nearby Kensington. Now these are shocking facts and statistics. And we have a moral duty to do our utmost to change this situation, to narrow the gaps between rich and poor and to work as hard as we can to make our society fairer. But sadly, today we also have another moral duty, which has to be a priority for this Government. We have a responsibility to all our families to deal with the deficit now, and not let our children shoulder the burden for past mistakes. So we need to reduce the deficit and return this country to a sound financial position. But it makes no sense - economically, socially or morally - to abandon poorer children along the way. To abandon families in need. To abandon hope for a better future. So as a government, we are committed to working with you to bring about sustained improvement and to make this country fairer. That’s why we’ll be refocusing Sure Start, ring-fencing its budget for this year and introducing extra health visitors, dedicated to helping the most disadvantaged families. That’s why we are introducing the Pupil Premium - money targeted specifically to disadvantaged school pupils, to offer them that little bit of extra help for them to fulfil their academic potential. And that’s why we’ll be extending free child care for three- and four-year-olds to 15 hours a week and we’ll fund early learning for more than 20,000 of the most disadvantaged two-year-olds. So we remain committed to improving the lot of those in need in our society and dedicated to a vision of a country that is fair, free from debt and family friendly. Removing barriers for families And we are doing this because we understand just how important families are. They are the bedrock of our society. Evidence shows that the family setting has the biggest impact on children and their outcomes. And we believe that families need the freedom to live their lives as they see fit. They don’t need Government to burden them with regulation after regulation, and restriction after restriction. Government’s role, we believe, is to help foster the right environment in which families can thrive - to empower them and help reduce the pressures and stresses they may face. And we know that families consistently say, that friends and neighbours are the essential support. We know that informal support, and informal networks are just as vital - and Mark, you mentioned intergenerational support, which is absolutely vital too. And that’s why the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister have set up a Childhood and Families Task Force. To tackle the barriers that prevent a happy childhood and a successful family life. The Task Force will be meeting for the first time, this week, to agree its programme of work so I don’t want to pre-empt that. But to give you a flavour, the Deputy Prime Minister identified the sort of issues it could look at when he announced the Task Force a few weeks ago. For example, parents often say that they don’t have enough time to spend together as a family. Many feel they still don’t have their preferred working arrangements, and some are concerned that asking to work flexibly may have an adverse impact on their career. We’re already committed to looking at a system of shared parental leave and extending the right to flexible working to all. We have work to do in terms of relationship support - helping families going through breakdown and supporting them in times of need. And also to support families with a disabled child. I know that the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister have a strong commitment to look hard into these challenges. So from the very top of Government, we are committed to tackling those barriers and restoring the culture of community and responsibility that is so crucial to the safety and success of our children and families. Working with you But of course, we know that Government alone cannot solve all of society’s ills. And the Report Card published today, shows that clearly. It shows the importance of the neighbourhood and of the experience families have in their area, and is an example of just how important voluntary sector organisations are in boosting family relationships in the community. Because we cannot tell families how to lead their lives. And in this time of financial strain, we need to find creative methods to achieve our ambitions. So, we need to work even closer with our partners. We need to learn from your experience, your ideas and your expertise. We need to make it easier for those local experts and voluntary organisations which already do such great work, to play a bigger role, to work together with statutory agencies and make even more of a difference to families around the country. Because you here represent the very best of our vision for a Big Society - a society in which more people play their part and take responsibility for each other. So we recognise the need to work with you and to really, honestly, listen to your experience and your ideas. Conclusion So I very much look forward to working with all of you in the months and years ahead, and I particularly look forward to reading the report FPI will produce as a result of this conference, and which they have promised to forward to me soon. I hope that together, we can see some real change for the better and create a fairer, stronger, safer society. Where those gaps we all talk about are narrowing, not widening. And where our families can prosper, even in difficult times. So in closing, let me say thank you for having me here today. Thank you once again for all the good work that you do for children and families in this country. And thank you for listening."

/government/news/the-department-for-educations-response-to-public-comments-on-the-coalition-agreement-on-families-and-children,"We welcome the comments made in response to the families and children agenda set out in ‘The Coalition: Our Programme for Government’. Although we will be reflecting upon all the comments made, there were some recurring issues that we would like to address immediately. There was a wealth of comments on the role of family in building cohesive societies. The Government recognises this and wants to empower families by dismantling the barriers that prevent them from giving children a fair start. Too often, families worry their children are being forced to grow up too early, that teenagers do not have enough activities available, and that it is difficult for both parents to balance their working and family lives. That is why the Prime Minister has set up a childhood and families task force to look at the barriers to a happy childhood and a successful family life. It is clear from the comments made, that where families do separate, the process can be tough for all involved, particularly when the case goes through the law courts. The Family Justice Review was launched earlier this year to examine the effectiveness of the family justice system in England and Wales and the outcomes it delivers. It also aims to make recommendations for reform, so that families can reach arrangements that are in the best interests of the children and which value the roles of both parents and the particular support grandparents can bring when parents’ relationships have broken down. This review will produce final recommendations for government in 2011. Many of you also commented on our commitment to take Sure Start back to its original purpose of early intervention and increase its focus on the neediest families. Sure Start children’s centre leaders, their staff and volunteers are dedicated and committed to improving the life chances of vulnerable children - but we know there is more to do to help the most deprived families access children’s centre services, so that problems are tackled before they arise. Sure Start children’s centres can help to address inequalities that are rooted in the very start of a child’s life. We want to see services for the neediest families designed locally, and delivered based on the best available evidence on what works. As many of you commented, health visitors play a really critical role, which is why the Government is currently looking at how best to deliver the commitment to an extra 4200 health visitors. We are working with a range of stakeholders (including children’s centre leaders, LAs, health professionals and service users themselves) to take this work forward. Concern was raised by many families about the affordability of childcare provision. We are clear that we will continue to support free nursery provision. This is why we have announced that from September the free entitlement will extend to 15 hours per week for all three- and four-year-olds for this year. We also want to encourage a diverse range of providers and we are listening to the views from all parts of the sector on how this can best be done, bearing in mind the current primary legislation requires LAs to secure Early Years provision free of charge. We have discussed with our colleagues in other government departments the concerns raised about reforms to the tax-benefit system and the impact this may have on families across the country. The Government is clear in its commitment to reform welfare and taxes, and we can confirm plans will be brought forward to reduce the couple penalty in the tax credit system as savings are made from wider welfare changes. We will also be setting out our priorities for children, young people and families (including our commitments to tackle the challenges faced by children with special educational needs and disability) in the coming months.

/government/news/quality-nurseries-urged-to-make-full-use-of-flexibility,"Fewer than 1 in 3 nurseries and early years providers take advantage of flexible arrangements allowing them to employ graduate leaders, a conference heard today. Teachers can currently teach up to 13 children aged 3 and 4 years. But that ratio falls to 1:8 when teachers are not present. Employing better qualified staff means young children get better quality early education that helps them to prepare for school. The government agrees with Ofsted that the way to raise quality within the current funding envelope is for more nurseries to hire graduates and use the larger group sizes and structured methods that this permits. This is what happens in France where salaries and qualifications are higher but funding is the same as England. Elizabeth Truss, Education and Childcare Minister, said that providers which do make use of more flexible arrangements alongside graduate leaders get better outcomes for young children. Highly qualified staff with larger groups of children means young children get more stimulating and structured learning which feeds their curiosity. She also said that what was evident from early years settings in France was the emphasis they placed on encouraging socialisation through structured group sessions. Eight 2-year-olds were happily able to sit together and watch each other’s behaviour while the teacher led the session. Free flow play, a child-centred approach where individual children choose what to do, is often considered to be a requirement in English settings. This is a myth and there are no reasons why structured teacher-led sessions can’t also be the norm here. Elizabeth Truss said: Early education, by providing a valuable foundation for a young child, goes on to have a profound effect on that child’s future for decades to come. Larger groups of children led by teachers are the gold standard. At every age we have studied, there is a benefit to involving graduates in education, and particularly so for pre-school age children. Highly qualified staff help to stimulate young children’s natural curiosity and prepare them for school. They provide structured learning that engages and develops young minds. The minister also said there is not a contradiction between playing and structured learning. For example, Alexandra Nursery School in Bolton teaches 3- and 4-year-olds counting through songs. Young children also count blocks when building a wall and count ingredients when making gingerbread men. After this start, children are known to make significant progress when they leave nursery. Elizabeth Truss also: welcomed Ofsted’s plans for a more rigorous inspection regime for the early years, which was announced today explained the strong focus on structured learning in France, where particular attention is given to social skills and manners said that Teach First early years trainees will begin working with children as young as 3 from September 2014 Notes to editors Elizabeth Truss was addressing ‘2-year-olds: policy and practice’, Nursery World’s conference on early education in west London.

/guidance/consistent-financial-reporting-framework-cfr,"This guidance applies to maintained schools and pupil referral units and is for: local authority finance officers school finance officers business managers bursars It is optional for nurseries and non-maintained special schools. Introduction The consistent financial reporting (CFR) framework provides a standard template for schools to collect information about their income and expenditure by financial years, which maintained schools provide to their local authorities in a financial statement each year. Financial statements must be in line with the approved headings set out in the The Consistent Financial Reporting (England) Regulations 2012 . The guidance provides definitions for each CFR code set out in the regulations. Financial statements include: school resources received in a financial year, including any unspent at the end of the previous year the application of any school resources a summary of the school’s financial position at the end of the year The information supports benchmarking and enables governors and local authorities to produce simple reports. The financial benchmarking website enables comparisons of school income and expenditure profiles with similar schools.

/government/news/more-focused-inspection-to-drive-improvements-in-early-years,"Ofsted has today announced changes to the way it inspects early years providers , such as nurseries and childminders. From September, Ofsted inspection of early years providers will be more focused on children’s education and their personal and emotional development. Inspectors will give greater attention to the progress children make in their learning. The changes will also give those looking after children more freedom in managing their own service, while continuing to keep children safe by strengthening registration and maintaining rigorous enforcement for those who are not complying with requirements. National Director Education, Susan Gregory, said: It is crucial that children’s earliest experiences give them the best start in life. Through better inspection Ofsted wants to help ensure that every child has the best possible support in their learning and development, whilst ensuring that they are safe and well cared for. That’s why inspections are going to focus even more on interactions with children, and less on paperwork. Observation of activities to develop children’s knowledge, understanding and skills in the main areas of learning, as well as care practices, will continue to be at the heart of inspections and providing feedback to those working with children will remain a high priority. Early years providers will be given a judgement on their overall effectiveness that will take into account how well their provision meets the needs of the range of children who attend, how well they identify any particular needs children may have and arrange appropriate help; the contribution practitioners make to the well-being of children and the effectiveness of leadership and management. In particular, inspection will consider the extent to which all children are supported to acquire the skills and capacity to develop and learn effectively and be ready for the next stages in their learning, especially school. In order to improve the information provided to parents, Ofsted will be making inspection reports more user-friendly. The new reports will include a front page summary, recommendations for good practice and any actions we have required providers to take. To ensure that parents get more information about the quality of provision for their children, Ofsted is changing the way it investigates concerns. In most cases where Ofsted receives information that raises concerns, rather than simply investigating the issue, inspectors will carry out a full inspection and publish the report on Ofsted’s website. This will allow parents to have a fuller picture of provision and also gives providers more opportunity to set the concern in context of the overall quality of provision. The timing of these inspections will depend on the nature of the concern and its potential seriousness for the welfare of children attending. In cases where the information, if true, would suggest there are, or could be, risks to children, we will carry out that inspection as quickly as possible. To allow providers more flexibility in managing their own service, Ofsted will no longer routinely issue restrictions or conditions on registrations, such as the number of children they may care for. Instead Ofsted will draw parents’ and providers’ attention to the relevant legal requirements set out in the EYFS. This means that when providers want to do something such as change the number of children they can look after, they simply need to check if the EYFS allows them to do this. Ofsted will also introduce changes to the way it registers people wishing to provide childcare.

/government/speeches/deputy-prime-ministers-speech-on-early-interventions,"I would like to thank Graham Allen, and his fellow reviewers George Hoskin and Michael Little, for their work in producing this first report on Early Intervention for the Government. The Government will be responding formally to the Report in due course, and I am delighted that Graham will be presenting his report to my colleague Iain Duncan Smith, who is leading much of the Government’s work in this area. I would also like to thank Graham personally for his long-standing interest in the area of early years investment. It is absolutely clear, as the report confirms, that investment in the early years of life leads to huge economic, social and emotional benefits later on, both for individuals and for society as a whole. The report helpfully highlights the importance of what it calls ‘school-readiness’. The gaps that exists today in ‘school readiness’ mean that by the time they hang up their coats for their first day at school, children from different backgrounds are already on different tracks, already pointed to very different futures. The Coalition Government has made a particular commitment to these critical, foundation years. This commitment can be seen in our additional investment in 15 hours a week of early years education for the poorest 2 year-olds in our society, on top of pre-school provision for all 3- and 4-year olds. The foundation years are quite simply the foundation of a fairer, more socially mobile society. As a Government, we are committed to improving social mobility as the principal objective of our social policy. When inequalities are passed on from generation to generation, the divisions in society become fixed. That is when temporary inequality turns into permanent social segregation. We also know as a Government that the investments we need to make now to create a fairer society will take many years to take effect. There is a time-lag, delay,  that very often discourages the necessary investments. This is an area where we need to think much more innovatively about the possibility of new funding mechanisms. And I know that Graham’s next report will look in more detail at the complex, vitally important area of financing social projects - another area where he has been a pioneer. Next month, the Government will set out our plans in this area in some detail when we publish our Social Investment Strategy paper. But I want to take the opportunity today to say a little more about the Government’s thinking. The Coalition is expanding our thinking on social finance. We are gladly building here on work undertaken by the previous Government. But we are determined to go further and faster, in terms of creating a genuine movement for social investment. There are a wide range of proven social investments in areas such as early years investments - as today’s report points out - as well as work with repeat offenders, or intervening with problem families. And there is a huge opportunity to draw on the considerable pools of capital outside government to provide funding for many of these projects. I do not want to understate the complexities in this area, many of which Graham and his team have already noted in their first report. How best to capture the economic returns from social investments, which are inevitably spread over different services, and often over very long time scales? What are the right institutional arrangements for managing both the projects themselves, and the investments? But these difficulties, real though they are, should not blunt our ambition in this area. There is the potential to open up genuine new opportunities for social  investments - and we must seize them. There is already a successful project in Peterborough, financed by social capital, working with offenders to reduce rates of re-offending - saving money and transforming lives. It is early days, but the signs are encouraging. The ten local authorities that make up Greater Manchester are working with the Government on the possibilities of a social investment for problem families, including schemes such as the family nurse partnership. We know that intervening with families with multiple problems is expensive -  in some cases, up to as much as £20,000 a year. But we also know that over the long term, the savings generated can be far greater. If we can help youngsters stay out of care, and out of trouble, and out of jail, the social and economic benefits are huge. The long-term savings from helping the families with the deepest problems far outweigh the upfront cost. The challenge is to find creative ways to bridge the gap between the initial investment and the long-term returns. But right here, in the City of London, we have one of the most innovative financial services centres in the world. Social investment is an area where the expertise of the financial services industry could be usefully deployed. The Coalition Government has said clearly that we need a new social contract between the financial services industry and broader society. Financial services do not exist in a social vacuum, indeed no single commercial sector can operate in isolation from the values of wider society. The financial institutions of the City have an important role to play, not only in rebalancing the economy, but also in rebalancing society in a fairer direction. So, I want to see social investment move from the margins to the mainstream. That requires imagination and hard work on the part of government, local institutions and financiers.  I can assure you today that the Coalition Government is willing to play our part. Thank you."
/government/publications/ofsteds-inspection-workforce-from-september-2015,"From September, Ofsted has made radical changes to the way we inspect schools, early years provision and further education and skills (FES). We have introduced a common inspection framework for these remits and new shorter inspections for good schools and FES providers led by Her Majesty’s Inspectors. Alongside these reforms, we have also made major changes to the inspection workforce."
/government/news/a-year-until-first-working-parents-receive-doubled-free-childcare,"With almost a year to go until some hardworking families can benefit from the government’s 30 hours of free childcare a week, innovative childcare providers are being asked to come forward as the first in the country to deliver the offer. It is being rolled out to parents in September 2016 - a year earlier than planned. As part of the government’s ‘One Nation’ plans to make sure hardworking families benefit from support with childcare as soon as possible, Education Secretary Nicky Morgan is asking childcare providers and councils to come forward with innovative and flexible ideas of how they would deliver the new offer from next year - as well as asking parents up and down the country how the extra hours will help them. The move follows a pledge from the government to increase the average funding rates paid to providers - a review with the sector on how to do this ended just this month. The government now wants childcare providers to come forward with their ideas of how they would deliver the extra hours of childcare next year. It also underlines the government’s commitment to help hardworking people, with £5 billion spent on childcare support - more than any previous administration and an increase of £1 billion since 2010. Also today (26 August 2015), new figures show the vast majority of working parents - more than 80% - would take up the extended offer of free childcare for 3- and 4-year-olds if it were available now. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan, who will be speaking to Rolls-Royce employees today about how the new offer could work for them, said: For too long, rising childcare costs have been a barrier to working parents and particularly mothers. This ‘One Nation’ government is on the side of hardworking people - that is why this time next year we’ll see the first families benefit from the government’s offer of 30 hours of free childcare for working parents. Today, we’re calling on providers to tell us how they can offer innovative, high-quality childcare that helps parents return to work while keeping more of their hard-earned money in their back pocket. The government is also reaching out to parents and employers to hear how plans to double the number of free hours for 3- and 4-year-olds will take pressure off household budgets and enable parents to work, if they want to do so. To do this, the Department for Education has joined forces with Facebook to reach as many parents as possible, and in particular those who wouldn’t normally respond to a government survey. Over 2,000 mums and dads have already joined the conversation, with more than three quarters responding to a Department for Education survey saying they would take up the offer of 30 hours free childcare, if it were available now. Education and Childcare Minister Sam Gyimah will be joining the Education Secretary on the visit to Rolls-Royce, which is just of one a number of events, held in conjunction with the Cabinet Office, at large employers, including Legal & General, Deloitte and Hewlett-Packard. At the firm in Derby, working parents with different skill sets and salaries will discuss what the extra 15 hours will mean for them. At previous events, parents have praised the impact the additional hours will have on their lives, saying they would “improve children’s stability and ability to form close friendships” and would “allow [them] to find more consistent arrangements”. Education and Childcare Minister Sam Gyimah said: We are committed to making sure that every family regardless of their background has access to high-quality, affordable childcare. I’m delighted that more parents than ever before are taking up the offer, with 99% of 4-year-olds and 94% of 3-year-olds now accessing 15 hours a week of free childcare. We want to create a productive economy that helps every family reach their potential, which is why we’re asking parents from all walks of life what difference the extra 15 hours will make to them. There are a number of other ways for parents to get involved in the conversation, including through the online survey , or by using the hashtag #30hourschildcare. This will feed into the work of the government’s childcare taskforce, which is driving forward the plans to benefit working families, and is headed by both the Childcare Minister and the Employment Minister Priti Patel. Priti Patel said: We want every family to be able to make the most of the opportunities created by our growing economy and to give their children the best start in life. That is why we are accelerating plans to double free childcare for working families, making childcare more affordable than ever before. Parents know what’s best for their families and we’ll now be speaking to them direct about their childcare needs. Further information on the government’s support for parents This government spends £5 billion on childcare - more than any previous administration and an increase of £1 billion since 2010. The new 30-hour offer provides the equivalent of 30 hours per week of free childcare, making every 3- and 4-year-old with working parents eligible for 1,140 hours of free childcare per year. This is worth £5,000 per child, per year. The 2-year-old offer gives 15 hours of free childcare per week to the 40% of children from the most disadvantaged backgrounds. It is worth £2,500 per child, per year. We are also supporting parents on lower incomes by providing up to 70% of their childcare costs through working tax credits, which will rise to 85% under Universal Credit from 2016. And, from 2017, the introduction of Tax-free Childcare will give up to 1.8 million families the opportunity to receive up to £2,000 of support per year, per child. We have introduced Shared Parental Leave and Pay which allow working parents to share up to 50 weeks of leave and up to 37 weeks of pay if they choose to. This means that they can decide who will be their child’s primary carer or share the responsibility between them. Since April 2015, employees have had the right to request flexible working, which has doubled the number of employees making a request to over 20 million. These initiatives will ensure that no woman is prevented from working because she has chosen to have children. Further supportive quotes Natalie Sigona, Rolls-Royce, Global Diversity and Inclusion Consultant, said: Rolls-Royce is committed to developing a diverse workforce and an inclusive working environment. In a rapidly changing and competitive economy we recognise how important it is to have an agile and flexible work environment to enable high performance. We support our employees in achieving a balance between work and home life and we are pleased that they have this opportunity to feedback their opinion on the government initiative. Emma Codd, Managing Partner for Talent at Deloitte, said: We know it is challenging to balance a career with family commitments, so welcome any measure designed to support working families. At Deloitte we have put in place a number of programmes to support working parents, including emergency childcare support, an agile working programme and a return to work scheme. From Jane Keith, HR Director, Hewlett-Packard, said: We recognise that working parents can face real challenges in finding and paying for quality childcare, and so were keen to give them the opportunity to help shape the government’s new policy in this area. We were overwhelmed with interest from parents at the first of our sites we consulted, so we’re running further sessions around the country to give the rest of our UK workforce the chance to contribute too. Knowing that their children are well cared for gives parents the capacity to give their best at work. Ted Hart, Head of Public Policy & Affairs, Legal & General, said: L&G is delighted to support this conversation. Making sure that parents can access the right childcare provision for their needs is key to delivering household resilience. Notes to editors See the online survey . The companies taking part in the discussion events include Accenture, BT, Deloitte, Hewlett-Packard, Intel, John Lewis Partnership, Legal & General, O2 and Carillion. All 3- and 4-year-olds already receive 15 hours of free childcare a week regardless of whether their parents work. The new offer provides the equivalent of 30 hours per week of free childcare over 38 weeks (equivalent to the academic year), making 3- and 4-year-olds with working parents eligible for 1,140 hours of free childcare per year. This will be worth around £5,000 per child, per year. The 2-year-old offer gives 15 hours of free childcare per week over 38 weeks of the year. It is available for the 40% of children from the most disadvantaged backgrounds. It is worth £2,500 per child per year. More information on flexible working or Shared Parental Leave is available. Organisations who would like to register their interest can do so by sending an email saying “I’d like to be an early implementer” to early.implementers@education.gsi.gov.uk before midday on Monday 28 September.

/government/news/minister-aims-for-new-culture-of-social-investment-in-childcare,"Supply for the thriving childcare market will be improved by a new culture of social investment being encouraged by the Department for Education. Demand for childcare is at an all-time high after the government’s popular offer of 15 hours of free childcare for all 3- and 4-year-olds, as well as 40% of 2-year-olds from low income families. Childcare Minister Sam Gyimah believes the market can expand even further thanks to the government encouraging a culture of social investment. Businesses looking to expand their presence in the early years market will be boosted by a new £500,000 Department for Education grant to help usher in the new culture through the Childcare Investment Readiness Fund. A wide range of organisations today (26 February 2015) met with Childcare Minister Sam Gyimah for a roundtable discussion on how social investment can further help the early years market. Childcare minister Sam Gyimah said: There is unprecedented demand for childcare - social investment would add to the record amount of money we are giving to the sector to help the market meet the modern families’ needs. Helping to improve a whole generation of children’s lives is something that I feel will be very appealing to many people. The Childcare Investment Readiness Fund will help providers to work with people who can help them to continue to grow. Any resulting social investment would be in addition to government funding. As well as our offer of more free hours to parents than ever before, childcare will soon be even more accessible for parents thanks to our policies of tax-free childcare and universal credit. Today’s roundtable discussed how social investment fund can help organisations expand their existing childcare presence to help families access as much good quality, affordable childcare as possible. The Childcare Investment Readiness Fund, which will be launched next month, is modelled on the Cabinet Office’s Investment and Contract Readiness Fund. It will support childcare providers with a proven track record to become more appealing to investors. Successful bids for the Investment Readiness Fund will receive up to £45,000 per partnership. Applications for the Investment Readiness Fund will be assessed by an ‘investment panel’ made up of experts who will decide which bids would make future social investment most attractive to social investors. Notes to editors Under this Parliament government funding for the childcare market has increased by £1 billion to almost £3 billion per year. Social investment provides capital that enables social organisations to deliver both social and financial returns. There are currently 180,000 social enterprises in the UK . They represent 15% of all small- to medium-sized enterprises and contribute over £55 billion to the economy. The Laing Buisson nursery market report estimates that the UK children’s day care market has risen by 4.1% year on year - and is currently worth £4.9 billion. Demand for childcare has increased thanks to the government offering 15 hours of free childcare to all 3- and 4-year-olds, as well as 40% of 2-year-olds. The upcoming offers of tax-free childcare and universal credit are likely to encourage more parents of young children to take up more hours of childcare. [Contact:997]"
/government/news/views-sought-on-inspecting-special-educational-needs-provision,"Inspectors from Ofsted and the Care Quality Commission (CQC) will assess how effectively local areas are fulfilling their obligations towards children and young people with special educational needs, under new proposals announced today (Monday 12 October). A new form of inspection will begin in May 2016. For the first time inspectors will evaluate how local authorities, nurseries, schools, further education establishments, and health services identify children and young people with special educational needs. They will also evaluate how well they provide services to meet these needs, both in nursery, school or further education college, and through specialist services, such as speech and language therapy, physiotherapy and mental health services. Crucially, inspectors will look at a sample of students’ files and information about their progress. Inspectors will visit early years settings, schools and further education colleges to see how they are helping to meet the local area’s responsibilities. Ofsted and the CQC want these inspections to act as a catalyst for improvement, so that some of the most vulnerable young people in the country benefit consistently from high-quality services to which they are entitled. The inspection reports will also highlight particular strengths and good practice in local areas, to encourage other areas to model similar practices. These evaluations will also include children’s and young people’s progress towards their next stage of education or employment. The overall aim is to see all children and young people with special educational needs do well in education, be more independent, find employment and be an increasing part of their local communities. Ofsted and the CQC are seeking the widest possible range of views from all those with an interest in disability and special educational needs. The consultation asks for responses to the following proposals: inspectors will evaluate how effectively the local area identifies disabled children and young people and those who have special educational needs inspectors will evaluate how effectively the local area meets the needs and improves the outcomes of disabled children and young people and those with special educational needs a wide range of information will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of local area arrangements. This will include the views of children and young people, parents and carers, recent inspection reports and visits to a number of local education and health service providers a wide range of approaches will be used during the inspection to obtain the views of disabled children and young people, and their parents and carers, including meetings, online questionnaires and social media Sean Harford, Ofsted’s National Director for Education, said: Inspection is a catalyst for improvement. We have seen that in schools and in other providers, where quality has risen over time. This has benefited hundreds of thousands of young people, giving them the prospect of a brighter future. We now turn our attention to the ways in which local areas deliver services for children and young people with special educational needs. We will look carefully at how the local area identifies the needs of young people and scrutinise how well it meets these needs. This includes nurseries, schools and colleges as well as the contribution of specialist services, such as speech therapy and other specialist educational and health services. We will want to see evidence that the children and young people are progressing well, to their next stage of education or employment. Effective local area support is crucial for these children and young people who really need them. Ofsted will highlight good practice, so that we can celebrate success. I hope that other areas will be inspired by this good practice, which will lead to improvements elsewhere. I also hope the result will be better support for some of the most vulnerable young people in society, helping to give them the best possible start in life.” Care Quality Commission Chief Inspector of General Practice, Professor Steve Field said: Young people and children with special educational needs or disabilities can face a complex system comprising many different health and educational agencies. It can be a bewildering experience for families having to coordinate different types of support. That’s why it’s important that we examine how well these different partners work together to meet the care needs of this often vulnerable group. It is absolutely right that in the twenty-first century, all children and young people receive the support they need and deserve. We need your views on how to best inspect in this area and urge you to help us define this critical programme.” This consultation will close on 4 January 2016. Notes to editors The consultation ‘The inspection of local areas’ effectiveness in identifying and meeting the needs of children and young people who are disabled and/or have special educational needs’ is online.

/government/speeches/sarah-teather-to-the-family-and-parenting-institute,"Thank you very much - it’s a great pleasure to be here today, especially for the start of Parents’ week. I’m really grateful to the FPI for hosting this meeting today. This is a really important agenda for the Government, and I hope that you recognise that by the support that’s been given at the highest levels of Government for this week. This is an issue which the Deputy Prime Minister, the Prime Minister and I take very seriously. The key point that I want to leave you with, as the Government’s Minister for Children and Families, is that this Government isn’t going to shy away from supporting family life. I do recognise that this is a controversial area - and it’s controversial both on the left and on the right. There are some people who will say it’s all about supporting marriage. Then you’ve got people who say it’s nothing to do with supporting marriage. Marriage is incredibly important in creating a supportive and happy environment, but it is not the only thing that we should consider when we’re thinking about supporting families, because we know that it is the quality of the family and parent-child relationships that really matter. I also think, in reflecting about supporting families and parents at this stage, that there is a tendency too often for families to become the public whipping boy for policy. After the riots, it’s right that we should think and ask questions about how we raise our children. But too often the debate becomes polarised into good parents and bad parents. That’s not helpful for anybody. All parents make mistakes. All parents find it a tough job. Most parents are desperate for more advice, more information and more support. Bringing up children is something that we all have a stake in, and we knock families at our peril. All of us have a stake in this. That’s demonstrated by the work that the FPI have done - in getting businesses involved as much as in the support that is offered to individual families. But I think that there is a very specific role for Government in trying to create the kind of society in which children grow up and develop well and in which family life can flourish. The evidence is clear. As Graham Allen and Frank Field have found in their reports, children’s life chances are heavily predicated on their development in the first five years of life. For children’s health, mothers’ health is critical in the early days and weeks. Two other factors are really important to children’s life chances: high-quality early years education and what we call the home learning environment. “The home learning environment has a greater influence on a child’s intellectual and social development than parental occupation, education or income.” That’s a very stark finding - it means that the way in which parents interact with their children in the very early stages of life can overcome many of the other factors associated with disadvantage. We know that this is very important. Supporting parents to do a good job is critical if the Government is serious about accessing the potential that all children have. That’s the reason that we have extended the free early years entitlement from 12.5 hours to 15 hours for all 3 and 4 year olds. It’s also the reason that we’re extending it to all disadvantaged two-year olds. There’s also significant, on-going work to improve the quality of the early years offer. But we need to do more if we want to support parents. Most new parents would expect to attend an antenatal class. They may decide to pay for that, or they may be able to have it for free. But parenting support once your child arrives has come to be seen as remedial or punitive. Something that is forced on you if something goes badly wrong or if your child is uncontrollable. I don’t think that’s a healthy way forward. I want to see more access and more choice for parents to parenting advice and support. That’s why I announced last month that the Government will shortly begin trialling an offer of parenting classes for mothers and fathers of children child aged 0 - 5 in three or four areas. The trial will give parents access to parenting classes during those first five years of their child’s life, so that they can have help with parenting until their child starts school. I hope that will begin to break that cycle that says that parenting classes are only something that happens when things go wrong, and that people will then feel confident, at a later stage, to access information and support. Today I am delighted to announce that those trials will run in three areas: Middlesbrough, High Peak and the London Borough of Camden. Officials from my Department have already been in touch with partners in those areas. They’ve been chosen specifically to make sure that we’re able to cover a rural area, an urban area, and areas with a very mixed population that have wealth and disadvantage living side by side. If this offer is going to work then it needs to be available to all parents. The classes won’t be compulsory. This isn’t the nanny state. But it is a response to the evidence that says that the home environment is the biggest single determinant of your child’s future success. I don’t think we can afford to ignore that evidence. It would be to squander the nation’s most precious resource - our children’s potential. But parenting classes are just one element in the spectrum of family support that this Government is providing. Sure Start Children’s Centres continue to play a vital part in their local community, alongside schools and NHS services. We believe that these centres should have a clear core purpose, focused on improving outcomes for young children and their families, with a particular focus on the most disadvantaged families - reducing inequalities in child development and school readiness; parenting aspirations, self esteem and parenting skills; and child and family health and life chances. We want areas who are trialling parenting classes to think about the role their local network of children’s centres can play - in terms of: children’s centres supporting families into parenting classes, through parenting classes, and after a parenting class has finished. And we know how important the support of health visitors can be, especially during those early years. This is why the Government is acting to strengthen the Healthy Child Programme through its commitment to an extra 4,200 health visitors by 2015. We’re also investing in relationship support - £30 million over the next four years - because we know that’s critical in supporting parents. Last week, we announced an increase in childcare support for families on low incomes. In addition, the Government has proposed to extend parental leave to both parents, to give families more flexibility and to encourage both parents to play their part. I believe passionately that this is a vital part of our commitment to families. BIS have recently concluded their consultation called the ‘Modern Work Place’ consultation, which addressed this issue. I believe that this is absolutely critical to supporting family life, and I’m very excited about this consultation. In the coming weeks, I’ll be announcing more support to help parents navigate through the wealth of information and advice available to mothers, fathers and carers, particularly on the internet. If you try Googling “parenting” you’ll receive over 200 million suggestions - not all of which will be relevant. We need to start helping parents navigate the enormous amount of parenting information and support available. That is why my Department and the Department of Health are jointly exploring ways of making digital information for parents of children between pregnancy and the age of five more easily accessible. The aim is that parents find specific information and advice when they need it and are signposted to high quality health and parenting content. I expect to be able to say more about this new service very shortly. Parenting isn’t just about supporting families in the early years. We know that things don’t always get easier as children get older. That’s why the commitment that the Prime Minister made very recently to a family ‘test’ is so critical. We want to do everything we can to ensure that policies help families flourish by supporting the financial well-being and work-life balance of families and promoting quality public services for them to use. I’m concerned that this test shouldn’t just pick up the broad sweep of issues or only cater for middle class families. If this test is going to work, it has to cater for families of all backgrounds. Families who may be more vulnerable, for example, because they have a child who has a disability, or because they fit into one of the categories which are less popular with the media. How are we supporting families who are involved in the criminal justice system, or who may be affected by benefit reform? These are the critical tests of how a family ‘test’ should work. But a family “test” operated wholly in Whitehall is unlikely to be the most effective way of achieving our aims. We need to know what real families think, and not just what civil servants think real families think. So that’s why I’ve been so grateful for the help of the FPI in developing our thinking so far. And we want to continue working with partners like you in developing the family “test.” If you want to make an input to the development of the family “test”, if there are obvious policy areas that you know need highlighting, or things that you think should be addressed by this family ‘test’ I’d encourage you to get in contact with the Families’ Strategic Partner, who offer advice to the Government on families’ issues, via our hosts today the Family and Parenting Institute. I just want to finish by saying that I’m incredibly grateful for the support, advice and challenge that everyone in the sector and beyond provides Government on its policy decisions. We are better for it! I know that families are feeling under pressure at the moment with the current fiscal situation. I know it’s tight and I know it’s difficult. But this Government is determined to do as much as it can to support families. I’m grateful for your help in making that happen."
/government/news/the-importance-of-leadership-in-the-education-and-skills-system,"Launching his first Annual Report , Sir Michael Wilshaw said that leadership in schools, in colleges and in local authorities was key to driving up standards and ensuring all young people get the good education they deserve. Today’s (27 November 2012) report is underpinned by the findings of nearly 25,000 inspections carried out during 2011/12 of early years and childcare, schools, colleges and adult learning and skills – providing a unique evidence base for the key conclusions. The main conclusions in this year’s Annual Report are: schools in England are getting better – although there is still a long way to go before the nation catches up with the best in the world there are wide variations in the performance of schools across different local authority areas, leading to serious inequities for children in some parts of the country Ofsted has identified major concerns with the quality of provision in the post-16 Learning and Skills sector, especially in colleges, which are not adequately preparing young people for the world of work Alongside the Annual Report, Ofsted has today launched a new service called Data View , an online tool which allows open access to, and the comparison of, inspection findings about the performance of providers at national, regional, local authority and constituency level over time. This year’s Annual Report comprises a main commentary by HM Chief Inspector, Sir Michael Wilshaw, supported by 3 remit reports giving more details on the early years, schools and learning and skills sectors. The social care annual report will be published in summer 2013 to tie into the inspection cycle in that sector. The key findings underpinning the headline conclusions for schools are: the proportion of schools rated as good or better is going up year on year. Three years ago 66% of all schools were judged to be good or better; that figure is now 70%. This means there are now nearly half a million more pupils in good or better schools there are nearly 1,000 more outstanding schools than there were 3 years ago; there are nearly 1,000 fewer inadequate and satisfactory schools than 3 years ago there are now 2,500 good and outstanding schools serving some of England’s most deprived communities Sir Michael said that the upward trend in the performance of the schools system could be put down to better leadership and a slow improvement in the quality of teaching. He said: Heads are now in the driving seat in a way I could only have dreamed of 20 years ago. They now have more autonomy and more control over their resources than ever before. A growing number of heads are also committed to improving schools beyond their own through cluster and federation arrangements. Academies are also making a difference. Most of the sponsored academies that we have inspected are better than the poor quality schools they replaced. Examples of the inequality of access to good or outstanding schools across different local authorities highlighted in the Annual Report include: a child living in Derby or Doncaster has only half the chance of attending a good or better primary or secondary school compared with a child living in Wigan or Darlington a parent in Coventry has only a 42% chance of sending their child to a good or better maintained primary school in the local authority area compared with a 92% chance for a parent living in the London Borough of Camden Sir Michael said: The inequities for local children are stark. This is completely unacceptable. That’s why I intend, from January, to use Ofsted’s new regional structure to inquire further into areas that are performing badly. We need to find out what is happening, and inspect where necessary. We will also work with local areas to support them and help them link up with best practice. The key findings underpinning the headline conclusions for learning and skills are: while the overall effectiveness of all Learning and Skills providers has improved very slightly over the past 3 years, the proportion of colleges judged inadequate or satisfactory is the highest it has been in that period 35% of colleges are now less than good compared to 30% at the end of 2010 Ofsted this year judged 13 colleges (serving over 82,000 leaners) to be inadequate compared with four colleges last year for the second year running, Ofsted did not judge a single college to be outstanding for teaching and learning Sir Michael said: The further education sector is a real concern for me at a time when the nation needs skilled and qualified people entering the workforce more than ever before. It is vital that the sector responds with high quality provision designed to tackle the urgent issue of youth unemployment. The government now needs to shine as much of a spotlight on this sector as it has done on schools. Schools have seen their increased freedoms balanced by a strong accountability system and action on failure. The same should be true for colleges. The Annual Report also covers the provision of early years education. Ofsted’s National Director for Early Years, Susan Gregory, will be delivering a major lecture next week on these findings and will set out views on improving the sector. The main findings in the early years report include: 74% of provision is good or better compared with 65% three years ago more than a third (34%) of children are not working securely in communication, language and literacy by the end of the Early Years Foundation Stage (below five years old) overall, pre-schools and nurseries are better than child-minders at preparing children for the next stage provision is weakest in areas of highest deprivation, particularly in the case of child-minders the quality of early years provision would benefit from stronger links between strong and weak providers, including good schools and good children’s centres Notes to editors The Annual Report 2011/12 is available online.

The sector report on social care will be published in summer 2013. This is because the inspection year for most social care provision, prescribed by regulations, runs from April to March. At the beginning of this year, Ofsted introduced a number of radical framework changes covering much of social care inspection activity. By publishing at a later date, Ofsted will be able to report on a full year’s inspection outcomes.

/government/news/reading-at-an-early-age-the-key-to-success,"Gove: Synthetic phonics will drive up basic literacy standards All children will be given a phonics-based progress check in year 1 so teachers can identify those not at the expected level in reading and in need of extra support, Education Secretary Michael Gove announced today. Mr Gove said too many primary school children were failing to reach the expected standard and that the short, light-touch test would be designed to assess how well year 1 pupils could read simple, decodable words. He added that the screening check would be based on systematic synthetic phonics as it was internationally proven to drive up basic reading skills from a young age. Mr Gove said it would be administered by pupils’ teachers and would be designed to confirm whether individual pupils had grasped the basics of phonic decoding by the end of year 1 identify those pupils who needed extra help, so the school can provide support. Today the government is launching a public consultation to ask teachers, parents, professionals and the public to submit views on how the check might work. It will be piloted in summer 2011 and will take place nationally from summer 2012. To help schools select an effective synthetic phonics programme, the government has published the core criteria that define the key features of such programmes. Michael Gove said: A solid foundation in reading is crucial to a child’s success as they progress through primary school, into secondary school and then in later life. But, in spite of the hard work of teachers and pupils, too many children are currently not reaching the expected reading levels at age 7 and age 11. We are determined to raise literacy standards in our schools, especially of those not achieving the expected level - a light-touch phonics-based check will provide reassurance that children in year 1 have learned this important skill, will enable us to pinpoint those who are struggling at an early age and will give them the help they need before it is too late. It will be impossible to drill for and will be a true gauge of a child’s reading skills. Parents want to know how their children are reading and this will tell them. On phonics, Schools Minister Nick Gibb, speaking on a visit to Elmhurst Primary School in Newham, London, said: There is more to reading than phonics - but there is also a weight of evidence that systematic synthetic phonics, taught in the first years of a child’s education, gives children key building blocks they need to understand words, underpins children’s attainment of a good standard of reading and can inspire a lifetime love of reading. The government is determined to raise the standard of reading in the first years of primary school so that children can master the basic decoding skills of reading early and then spend the rest of primary school reading to learn. The fact is that alternative methods have left too many young people with poor literacy levels, especially among children of more disadvantaged families, and we are determined that every child can read to their full potential. Provisional figures released earlier this year showed that in 2010: 15% of 7-year-olds failed to reach the expected level (level 2) in reading at key stage 1 19% of 11-year-olds did not achieve the expected level (level 4) in reading at key stage 2. England has also slipped down the international table for reading in primary schools. The Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS) of 10-year-olds saw England fall from third out of 35 countries in 2001 to 15th out of 40 countries in 2006. Shahed Ahmed, the Headteacher of Elmhurst Primary - one of the schools where the check will be pre-trialled, said: At Elmhurst Primary School we firmly believe that the best way to teach how to read in the early stages is through a rigorous, systematic, engaging phonics approach. I believe that all schools would benefit from taking this approach. It’s important that schools know for young children how good their phonics knowledge is. An end-of-year-1 phonics check would encourage all schools to teach early reading properly through phonics, and they would then know then the strengths and weaknesses of their pupils. Ruth Miskin, a leading authority on teaching children to read, said: Despite numerous well-meaning initiatives over recent years, we still have 20% of children who are unable to access a secondary school curriculum. However, there are many determined heads who ensure that every child learns to read by 6- or 7-years-old. There is no reason why this success cannot be replicated across the whole country. This reading check will help all headteachers focus their efforts upon the children who are most likely to slip through the net. If we catch these children early, they will have an equal opportunity to make the most of their education and lives. Ofsted will inspect the teaching of reading and phonics in schools and the impact on pupils’ results, and on 14 November 2010 it published a report showing best practice in the teaching of phonics. The information provided from this test will allow Ofsted and schools to have a better conversation about each school’s teaching of phonics. The government has also revised the core criteria that define the key features of an effective systematic synthetic phonics programme, to help schools in selecting a suitable programme. Publishers of products have been invited to submit new self-assessment forms for their products, assessing them against the new criteria. Jan Tyson, headteacher at Turnfurlong Infants School in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, said: Systematic synthetic phonics is key to teaching children reading and writing. It provides them with strategies to decode words, which is especially important because English is such a difficult language to learn with the many different ways to make the same sounds from different letters or combinations of letters. How phonics works Phonics focuses on sounds rather than, for example, having children try to recognise whole words. In analytic phonics, words are broken down into their beginning and end parts, such as ‘str-‘ and ‘eet’, with an emphasis on ‘seeing’ the words and analogy with other words. In synthetic phonics, children start by sequencing the individual sounds in words - for example, ‘s-t-r-ee-t’, with an emphasis on blending them together. Once they have learned all these, they progress to reading books. The ‘synthetic’ part comes from the word ‘synthesise’, meaning to assemble or blend together. Children who learn using synthetic phonics are able to have a go at new words working from sound alone, whereas those using analytic phonics are more dependent on having prior knowledge of families of words. Notes to editors It is a statutory requirement that all schools and early years settings in England teach ‘phonemic awareness’ and ‘phonic knowledge’. In Clackmannanshire, Scotland, a 7-year study of the teaching of synthetic phonics to 300 children found they were 3 years ahead of their contemporaries in reading by the time they moved on to secondary school. A 2005 Australian report, ‘Teaching Reading’, found: The incontrovertible finding from the extensive body of local and international evidence-based literacy research is that for children during the early years of schooling (and subsequently if needed) to be able to link their knowledge of spoken language to their knowledge of written language, they must first master the alphabetic code - the system of grapheme-phoneme correspondences that link written words to their pronunciations. Because these are both foundational and essential skills for the development of competence in reading, writing and spelling, they must be taught explicitly, systematically, early and well. The US National Reading Panel report of 2006 said:Systematic synthetic phonics instruction had a positive and significant effect on disabled readers’ reading skills. These children improved substantially in their ability to read words and showed significant, albeit small, gains in their ability to process text as a result of systematic synthetic phonics instruction. This type of phonics instruction benefits both students with learning disabilities and low-achieving students who are not disabled. Moreover, systematic synthetic phonics instruction was significantly more effective in improving low socio-economic status (SES) children’s alphabetic knowledge and word reading skills than instructional approaches that were less focused on these initial reading skills… Across all grade levels, systematic phonics instruction improved the ability of good readers to spell.

/government/news/phonics-check-and-key-stage-1-results,"The statistics show that in this year’s phonics check: almost 177,000 6-year-olds were identified as being below the expected level - they will now receive extra help from their teachers so that they catch up with their peers and become strong readers 69% of 6-year-olds (almost 423,000 pupils) reached the expected level (32 out of 40) - last year 58% of children achieved the expected level the government introduced the phonics check for 6-year-olds after figures showed 1 in 11 children left primary school in 2010 with a reading age no better than that of a 7-year-old Children who do not reach the threshold in the light-touch check are given extra reading help by their teachers so they catch up early in their school career, before it is too late. Phonics is internationally proven as the most effective method to teach children how to read, with a range of studies, including from the USA and Australia, supporting its use (see notes to editors). The check has increased schools’ focus on phonics. Over the last 2 years 13,400 schools have taken advantage of government funding to buy high-quality synthetic phonics products or training so they can improve their teaching. Education Minister Elizabeth Truss said: We are committed to improving children’s reading. The phonics check helps teachers identify those pupils who need extra help in learning to read. Many thousands of children will now receive the extra support they need to catch up with their peers and develop a love of reading. Teacher assessment figures for reading, writing, speaking and listening, maths, and science at the end of key stage 1 are also published today. They show that from last year the proportion of 7-year-olds reaching the expected level (level 2) rose 1 percentage point in reading to 89%, 2 points in writing to 85%, 1 point in speaking and listening to 89%, and 1 point in science to 90%.

/government/news/consultation-on-radical-changes-to-inspection,"Launching an eight-week consultation, Sir Michael Wilshaw said the reforms would bring about a radically different inspection regime designed to maintain and accelerate improved educational standards in England. Sir Michael said: Most schools and colleges have been improving over the past couple of years at a faster rate than ever before. This is hugely encouraging and testament to the commitment of leaders and teachers to deliver a higher standard of education for our children and young people. They have responded to Ofsted’s more challenging inspection frameworks, in particular the introduction of the Requires Improvement judgement and our insistence that only good is good enough. This has been central to driving improvement. It is absolutely vital that this progress is sustained and that our system does not falter. Over two thirds of good schools and colleges maintain their performance, and so there is a strong case for more proportionate inspections which focus on a professional dialogue between head teachers and inspectors. But by no means all of them do. In the past academic year alone 860 schools we inspected, attended by 335,000 children, declined in performance. The time has come, therefore, to introduce frequent but shorter inspections for good schools and further education and skills providers. These inspections will be different to what has gone before. They will have a much clearer focus on ensuring that good standards have been maintained. In particular, inspectors will be looking to see that headteachers and leadership teams have identified key areas of concern and have the capability to address them. For good schools and further education and skills providers who have the capacity to show this, the changes being proposed will mean that there is no longer any need for a full inspection. Led by Her Majesty’s Inspectors, these short inspections will encourage professional dialogue and the sharing of good practice from across the country. They also mean that we can spot signs of decline early and take immediate action. If we find significant concerns then we will carry out a full inspection. Where we think the school or provider may have improved to outstanding, we may also decide to carry out a full inspection to confirm this. At the moment, it can be five years or even more between inspections for a good school or provider. This is too long. It’s too long for parents and employers. It’s too long for us to spot signs of decline and it’s too long for improving institutions to show that they are now delivering an outstanding standard of education. Parents and employers also need to know how schools are performing on a more regular basis. Shorter but frequent inspections of good schools and colleges will mean that we can keep them much better informed. Sir Michael confirmed that Ofsted will retain the power to undertake a full inspection at any time where there are significant concerns about standards. Another key proposal due to take effect from next September is the introduction of a new common inspection framework, which will standardise the approach to Ofsted education inspections. This will be adapted to suit nurseries, schools and colleges, including the independent schools that Ofsted inspects, making it easier for parents, employers, pupils and learners to compare different providers and make more informed choices. Sir Michael said: I believe that our new inspections should place emphasis on safeguarding, the breadth of the curriculum in schools, the relevance of courses and training in further education and skills, and the quality of early learning. Only then will we be able to make sure that all children and learners are properly safeguarded and prepared for life in the modern world. The consultation also sets out proposals for four categories of judgements: leadership and management teaching, learning and assessment personal development, behaviour and welfare outcomes for children and learners Sir Michael also said that Ofsted would not be consulting on the question of whether to introduce routine no-notice inspections. I have already broadened the criteria Ofsted uses to judge whether an unannounced inspection is required for particular schools. After careful consideration, I have therefore concluded that we do not need to consult on moving to routine no-notice inspections at the present time. Notes to editors The consultation runs until the 5 December with the reforms taking effect from 1 September 2015. The proposal for shorter inspections for good schools would see inspections carried out by no more than two inspectors on site for one day, and would focus on whether the quality of the provision is being sustained. They are likely to take place every three years. Where no concerns arise about the performance of the school, or its leadership and management, then parents will receive a letter that sets out the main inspection findings. No changes are proposed to the inspection frequency of those providers classified as inadequate or requiring improvement. Alongside the proposed changes to the way Ofsted inspects, from 1 September 2015 the inspection of schools and further education and skills will no longer be outsourced. Instead, inspectors will be contracted directly to Ofsted, with Her Majesty’s Inspectors leading the great majority of inspections. Ofsted will consider the future of the early years inspection contracts when these end in 2016. The consultation also proposes that from 1 September 2015, all non-association independent schools will receive an inspection under the proposed common inspection framework within three years. The way by which outstanding schools are inspected will not change. The Office for Standards in Education, Children’s Services and Skills (Ofsted) regulates and inspects to achieve excellence in the care of children and young people, and in education and skills for learners of all ages. It regulates and inspects childcare and children’s social care, and inspects the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service (Cafcass), academies, colleges, initial teacher training, work-based learning and skills training, adult and community learning, and education and training in prisons and other secure establishments. It inspects services for looked after children, safeguarding and child protection.

/government/news/new-online-tool-to-make-finding-childcare-easier-for-parents,"Plans are underway to give parents information about quality, affordable and accessible childcare through a new online tool - the first of its kind, Childcare Minister Sam Gyimah announced today (6 February 2015). At the moment, although there is often a wealth of information available, parents have to navigate numerous sources to get to grips with the childcare available to them locally. It can be difficult to get simple information like costs and available places, or to work out how to combine different types of childcare like nurseries, nannies and childminders, making it challenging for parents to arrive at the best decision for their family. Ipsos MORI research published today shows that parents are unsure where to find information and often unaware of the full childcare provision in their area. Today, the government is launching a competition for online developers who are being invited to come forward with innovative ideas for a new online tool to bring together in one place everything parents need to know about the childcare available in their local area to help them pick the solution. This will be the very first government-backed technical solution of its kind. Childcare Minister Sam Gyimah said: Choosing childcare is one of the most important decisions any parent makes, but too often it’s hard to find out about all the options available to their family quickly and easily. We want all parents to have access to good-quality and affordable childcare, with all the information about what’s available locally at their fingertips. Instead of wasting time just trying to uncover what’s available, parents will have everything they need to weigh up what’s best for them in one place - such as costs, opening hours and available spaces. We’re looking for ideas from experts in digital technology on how to make this happen to make things easier for parents through a new ‘one stop shop’. The website or mobile phone app should make it easier for parents to find and arrange formal childcare provision and contain information that is up-to-date and useful. It should also enable parents to search in a way that suits them, such as by location or opening hours. Ideas could include: providing information about the entire range of childcare providers, including schools (so that details of wraparound care can be captured), nurseries and childminders designing a platform that makes it easy for providers to reach customers and manage their availability, and which allows parents to book and pay for childcare online enabling parents to rate and review provision to help others make informed choices, and to allow good providers to build strong reputations connecting to social media so that parents can see what provision their friends use and how they rate it making it easy for parents who use the same childcare provider to arrange to share pick-ups and drop-offs The competition is being run with Innovate UK through the Small Business Research Initiative ( SBRI ) - a scheme which enables public sector bodies to connect with innovative ideas and technology businesses. Successful applicants will share funding totalling £200,000 to further develop their proposal and bring it to market. Stephen Browning, Head of SBRI said: This is an excellent start to 2015 with DfE launching their first SBRI competition to drive innovation in this sector and support the needs of parents. The new website or app is intended to complement existing means of finding out about childcare, including the Family Information Service ( FIS ). The Ipsos MORI report concluded that parents should have access to the information they need to make informed choices about childcare - and it is especially important for parents returning to work to understand the financial support and range of options available to them. Its key findings include: the quality, accessibility and impact of information available to parents is variable parents are often unsure where to find information and often unaware of the full range of childcare provision available in their local area availability of childcare information in a range of forms is key to ensuring parents have access to the right information to inform their decisions The report called for an improvement to information that’s available to parents, including proposing a central site to bring together key information in an easily accessible digital format clearly signposting parents to the information they need.

/government/news/more-children-than-ever-starting-school-ready-to-learn,"New figures published today (13 October 2015) reveal more 5-year-olds than ever before are achieving the expected standards in maths and literacy - meaning more children are on the path to success during their first year of school. Statistics show that more than two-thirds of children aged 5 are making good progress against the early years foundation stage profile - a framework for the early years (under 5s) which ensures all children are prepared and ready for school and life. As a result of this government’s commitment to higher standards in every setting, today’s figures show that an extra 38,600 number of 5-year-olds are reaching the expected level of development in maths and literacy, as well as in prime areas of personal, social and emotional development, physical development and communication and language. This means they can count to 20, describe weight and shapes in everyday language, write their own name and read simple sentences, as well as play confidently with their friends - skills which are vital to fulfilling their potential. Education and Childcare Minister, Sam Gyimah, said: We know that the first few years of a child’s life are vital in terms of how well they go on to do at school and beyond. It is great news that more children than ever before are achieving the expected level of development in the early years, because parents should be confident that while their children are out of their care, they’re not only happy and having fun, but at the same time developing important skills - building confidence with numbers and letters - to ensure they fulfil their potential. In 2012, the government introduced a more rigorous early years foundation stage profile which reduced red tape to enable professionals and parents to work together on the key areas of learning that are most essential for children’s readiness for future learning and healthy development The early years foundation stage profile figures also show: 70% of children achieved at least the expected level in all early learning goals in literacy and 75% in maths girls continue to outperform boys in all early learning goals, with 74.3% of girls achieving the expected level of development compared with 58.6% of boys the attainment gap between the lowest attaining children and their classmates continues to decrease to 32.1% This government is committed to raising the bar and improving the care children receive. That is why we have introduced a number of initiatives to ensure that those who care for our children have extra support to help. These include: introducing the early years pupil premium - giving providers additional funding to provide specialist high-quality support for some of the most disadvantaged children ensuring all early years teachers must now meet rigorous new standards and pass the same skills tests as trainee school teachers changing the rules so that all early years educators, who are responsible for leading nurseries and educating and caring for young children will be required to have at least a C in GCSE English and maths which they can work towards whilst in training Notes to editor The actual increase was 46,800, but there were more children in 2015 than in the previous years. The equivalent increase of 38,600 is based on applying the 2014 percent achieving a good level of development to the number of children in 2015. The new early years foundation stage profile was introduced in September 2012 and is completed by teachers for all children in the summer term of their reception year at school. There is no test - assessment is based on teacher observations throughout the year. Teachers make a best-fit assessment of whether children are emerging, expected or exceeded against 17 early learning goals. Children are deemed to have a good level of development in the new profile if they achieve the expected level in the prime areas of personal, social and emotional development, physical development and communication and language, and the specific areas of and literacy and mathematics.

/government/speeches/michael-gove-on-public-sector-pension-reforms,"Introduction Tomorrow, the Chancellor will deliver his Autumn Statement. It will contain a series of measures to get our economy moving in the right direction and help people - especially young people - get working. On Wednesday, TUC leaders will call on their members to bring Britain to a halt. Among those Union leaders are people who fight hard for their members and whom I respect. But there are also hardliners, militants itching for a fight. They want families to be inconvenienced. They want mothers to give up a day’s work, or pay for expensive childcare, because schools will be closed. They want teachers and other public sector workers to lose a day’s pay in the run-up to Christmas. They want scenes of industrial strife on our TV screens; they want to make economic recovery harder; they want to provide a platform for confrontation just when we all need to pull together. I’m speaking out today because I know what it’s like to go on strike because some people at the top of a Union leadership wanted to prove a point. I lost my job. So did more than one hundred others. I was lucky - young, unmarried, without a mortgage. I got another job soon enough. Many others didn’t. They never worked again in the profession they loved. And the deal we were offered before the strike never improved. So today I want to appeal directly to teachers - and other public sector workers: please, even now, think again. The economic backdrop Think firstly of the uniquely difficult economic circumstances this country faces. Since John Hutton first reported on the future of pensions, and since we first began negotiating to get a deal, the global economic situation has deteriorated. Growth has slowed everywhere. Nations that spent billions on an economic stimulus plan - like America - now have growth rates similar to ours and unemployment rates worse than ours. Nations that have failed to reform their labour markets - like Spain - have huge unemployment problems - especially youth unemployment problems. Nations that have failed to reform their public sector pension schemes - like Italy and Greece - lost the confidence of international investors, have had to pay massive sums just to service their debts and now have to contemplate yet more cuts. And even nations hitherto thought safe - such as France and the Netherlands - are under threat from speculators, as questions are asked about the robustness of their national balance sheets. Britain is in a different position to those Eurozone nations. Because we took action early. To lay out a robust plan. Not just to bring our deficit under control by the end of this Parliament. But also to introduce reforms to improve our education system further. And make decent public sector pensions sustainable. If we don’t stick to that path of reform, if we undermine the credibility that George [Osborne] and Danny [Alexander] have won for our country, then the consequences could be grimmer than many have yet envisaged. If investors think we’re not serious about bringing both the deficit and our future liabilities under control, then we could find interest rates rise to levels where economic recovery is threatened, where businesses pay much more for finance, where new job creation is undermined, where mortgage costs rocket, eating up disposable income and reducing consumption, where much more public spending has to be spent servicing debts, so less is available for schools, the early years and the NHS. So pension reform isn’t a marginal issue. Nor is confrontation, or protracted wrangling or a lack of agreement in anyone’s interests. And that’s why the Government, even as the global economic situation has worsened, has been more generous - not less - in its approach to public sector pensions. Because we want agreement. We want a sustainable deal for the future which gives certainty to teachers and others that they will have defined benefits in retirement. And we want to invest as much as possible in the education frontline. Putting schools first That’s why we’ve reduced non-frontline expenditure - we’re cutting the central costs of administration in the DFE - by more than a third. We’ve looked everywhere for economies. We’ve cut unnecessary travel costs: we reduced expenditure on first class rail travel by 90 per cent. While the last Government spent £2.46 million on first class travel in 2009/10, we have spent just £265,000 in 2010/11. We’ve sought to limit spending on everything unnecessary - so we spent only £25,000 in the last 12 months on new furnishings in the DfE. The previous government spent £1.66 million in 2007/08 and £765,000 in 2008/09. In our desire to see economies everywhere, we’ve got rid of the fruit bowls that used to be delivered to every minister and sent back the Government art. And as well as looking at every area - no matter how small - to make savings, we’ve made some tough decisions to reduce expenditure. Quangos - all with separate boards, comms teams and premises - have either been abolished or accepted significant cuts. The QCDA, BECTA and the GTCE have gone. The NCSL, TDA and Office of the Children’s Commissioner have borne big reductions in spending. And, perhaps most painful of all, we had to stop the Building Schools for the Future programme - because it was inefficient, poorly targeted and exceptionally poor value for money. Instead - under Sebastian James - we developed plans to build schools more cheaply, taking advantage of new technology and reforms of planning rules and regulations. And it’s because we took those decisions - to show we were determined to make every penny go further and put the frontline first - that the Treasury have been able to prioritise education. Apart from the protected areas of Health and International Development, Education got the best revenue spending settlement in last year’s comprehensive spending review. And since then our commitment to reform has helped the Treasury go further. So more has been released to help schools. £600 million for new free schools, with areas of poverty and population growth prioritised. And £600 million more to help local authorities create more good school places in areas where the population is rising fastest. And - perhaps most crucially of all this week - the arguments we were able to make about the success of our reform programme on the ground helped the Treasury to release additional funds to improve the pension offer we are able to make to teachers. It’s really important teachers appreciate this point. The success of reform, the growth in Academies, the more efficient use of resources on the frontline, the commitment of the profession to ever higher standards - these have all helped make the case for a better deal for teachers. Supporting teachers And the offer we’re making is a good deal. Since becoming Education Secretary, I’ve been determined to improve the position of the teaching profession. Teachers and heads deserve our support. That’s why I’ve fought for legislative time to get new laws to strengthen teachers’ disciplinary powers. That’s why I’ve reduced the bureaucracy and red tape teachers face - scrapping bumf like the 100 page Self-Evaluation Form, getting rid of the requirement to record every incident when a pupil has to be restrained, making clear there’s no obligation for every teacher to have a written lesson plan for every lesson. That’s why we’ve faced down opposition from vested interests to give teachers anonymity if they face malicious allegations from pupils. That’s also why we’ve reformed inspection to make it more responsive to teachers’ needs - and put a teacher in charge. And why we listened to the profession’s legitimate concerns about tests at the end of primary - and reformed them. It’s also why we’ve pushed ahead with the Academy programme - Academies give teachers greater control over how they teach, and because money is used more efficiently in Academies, teachers in Academies often enjoy better pay than in other schools. The same determination to support teachers has driven my personal approach to pension reform. Because I’m all too aware of the feelings of many of my constituents - and many others in the country - about pensions. … There are now very few private sector defined benefit schemes which are still open and which guarantee a fixed income in retirement. In March, the National Association of Pension Funds annual survey found that a record number of final salary pension schemes - one in five (17 per cent) - have shut their pension to both new and existing members. This was a record jump from seven per cent in the previous survey in 2009, and just three per cent in 2008. Most of these schemes will have already been closed to new joiners. Just 21 per cent of private sector schemes are now open to new joiners, compared with 88 per cent ten years ago. A third (33 per cent) of schemes are planning changes around their existing members, including cutting benefits or migrating staff to a defined contribution pension. Many of those affected among my constituents, and others across the country (including, for example, people let down by Equitable Life), want additional support from the Government. I have to justify to them why we, as a Government, are prioritising a good deal for teachers. I do so because I believe that teaching is a noble profession, the most important vocation in the country. But let no one think there isn’t a political cost to safeguarding public sector pensions in this way. There are many citizens working in the private sector who feel short-changed. I understand their concerns. But I also think it’s important we continue to attract the very best young graduates into teaching and retain experienced teachers. I’d like to do more for teachers - and over time - I hope we will. We will, for example, soon introduce new bursaries and rewards for top graduates in science and maths who train as teachers. But it’s important now for me to defend the position teachers are in. Teachers earn - on average - the same as other graduates. £34,800 compared to the national average for graduates of £35,900. Teachers in Academies earn more. Head teachers and others in leadership positions earn more than other graduates in managerial roles: £55,200 compared to £52,600. At a time when some are seeing their earnings in the private sector declining, I want to defend the principle that teachers salaries should be protected - and in due course enhanced. I will do so at every opportunity. But that depends on all of us together showing that we are not complacent - and we are determined to go further in reform and raising standards. Members of the public - including many of my constituents - argue that teachers enjoy longer holidays and greater employment security than most other workers. But I respond by saying that teaching is physically and emotionally demanding - and given the problems with poor pupil behaviour and the importance of continuity in learning, teachers deserve strong employment protection. And I deploy similar arguments when I’m challenged on the deal we’re now offering teachers on pensions. A good deal - fair, affordable, secure I say it’s because I think those in the private sector have suffered because of thoughtlessness - and a failure to plan ahead - by both Government and some employers, that we have to protect public sector workers - and teachers especially - from a failure to plan properly now. I believe teachers must have the reassurance that comes from knowing that, on retirement, they will get a guaranteed income. The Government remains committed to ensuring pensions continue to be index-linked to protect them from inflation. As I say again: there are scarcely a million private sector workers in open schemes like that, so it’s more important than ever that we defend that security for teachers. And in terms of defending security, we’ve made some other things absolutely inviolable. Anyone within ten years of their retirement age on April 1st next year will have their pensions totally protected; entirely unaffected; secure exactly as before. And all teachers - let me underline that: all teachers - will have the money they’ve put in and the benefits they’ve secured - totally protected. Accrued rights are untouched. If you’ve paid in for a number of years, at a set rate, in the expectation that will deliver a proportion of your final salary on retirement, that will remain secure. And, with inflation at its current levels, let me confirm that pensions will continue to be index-linked - through thick and thin. The Government will bear that risk. But there do need to be changes to ensure those benefits - and other future benefits - can be delivered. Because all of us are living longer - and highly educated graduates are living longest of all - we need to make sure that we can carry on paying pensions to people who will be retired and on retirement incomes for much longer. The number of years teachers will enjoy in retirement is set to rise. The proportion of a teacher’s whole lifetime spent in the classroom will shrink. And the proportion of that same life spent in retirement will grow. So we need to take account of that. And we particularly need to take account of the fact that these very welcome increases in life expectancy are proving even greater than the experts predicted. The average 60-year-old can expect to live ten years longer now than 30 years ago. 40 to 45 per cent of adult lives are now spent in retirement compared with around 30 per cent for pensioners in the 1950s. Life expectancy in the UK has reached its highest level on record for both males and females. The number of centenarians in the UK in 2010 is five times higher than was estimated in 1980. The percentage of the population aged 65-plus increased from 15 per cent in 1985 to 17 per cent in 2010 - that’s an increase of 1.7 million people in this age group. Over the same period, the percentage of the population aged under 16 decreased from 21 per cent to 19 per cent. This trend is projected to continue. By 2035, 23 per cent of the population is projected to be aged 65 and over, compared to 18 per cent aged under 16. Not only is the population ageing, but there has been progressive ageing of the older population. Most striking has been the increase in the number and proportion of the ‘oldest old.’ In 1985, there were around 690,000 people in the UK aged 85 and over, accounting for one per cent of the population. Since then the numbers have more than doubled reaching 1.4 million in 2010 (two per cent of the UK population). In comparison to the UK average, figures for teachers show even greater life expectancy. And between 2004 and 2010 the number of teachers working beyond age 60 increased from 9,909 to 31,572. Regardless of any changes to teachers’ Normal Pension Age or the State Pension Age, teachers will retain options to retire at any age between 55 and 75. In talking about longevity, I have to address one myth that has developed: the idea that I’m asking all teachers to work for longer - indeed insisting that every teacher must be in the classroom until they’re 68. That’s just not true. Let me go into some detail to explain why. Teachers who joined the Teachers’ Pension Scheme prior to 2007 currently have a Normal Pension Age of 60. Those who joined from 2007 have a Normal Pension Age of 65. We’re proposing a phased increase in the Normal Pension Age for all teachers to align with the State Pension Age (which is currently 65 and due to increase to 68 by 2046). Under our proposals, teachers will still be able to take their pension at any age from 55 to 75. But the annual pension income will vary depending on when teachers choose to retire. All of the pension they have built up under the current scheme will remain payable in full at either 60 or 65, depending on whether they joined the scheme before or after 2007. Only the pension teachers build up under the reformed scheme would normally be payable at a later age, but they will still be free to draw that pension at any point from your 55th birthday. And I should add that the ratio between what you pay in every year and what you get out over time - the accrual rate - has been specifically improved following lobbying from the Departments for Education to ensure teachers are protected. As Lord Hutton has acknowledged: “Accrual rates - the vital part of the detail of any pension scheme, which determine the value of pension rights - have also been greatly improved. This will increase the generosity of pension benefits, and bring the proposed new scheme very much into line with the arrangements for new recruits that were agreed between the Unions and the last government.” So what will that mean in practice for teachers? Well… Let me take you through a few examples of hard cases: A teacher aged 27 in 2015 who began teaching at 22 and remained a classroom teacher until they retired on point U3 on the payscale at age 68 could expect a pension of £28,000 per annum, £23,000 if they retired at 65 or £16,000 by retiring at 60. A teacher aged 35 in 2015 who began teaching at 25 and retired aged 68 from a leadership post on point L21 could expect a pension of £37,000 per annum, £31,000 if they retired at 65 or £22,000 by retiring at 60. They would also receive a lump sum of £23,000 at each age. A teacher aged 49 in 2015 who began teaching at 22 and remains a classroom teacher until they retire on point U3 at age 66 could expect a pension of £23,000 per annum, £22,000 if they retired at 65 or £17,000 by retiring at 60. They would receive a lump sum of £37,000 at each age. The Department for Education has developed a pensions calculator - which is on our website - which allows any teacher to punch in their details and see what they would secure. I encourage all teachers to use it to help them make a judgement about their future benefits. We take our responsibility to keep teachers informed about changes seriously, and so we contacted every teacher in the country directly last week to explain about the reforms in detail. I do not know of any - any - pensions provision in the private sector which can match the current offer in scope, certainty and generosity. And while I absolutely respect the right of teachers representatives to negotiate hard, they should, in fairness, join me in making clear that teachers who opt out of the pension scheme - or think they have to retire now in order to retain their pensions rights - are not acting in their own best interests. It would be extremely unlikely to be in a teacher’s interest to opt out of the Teacher Pension Scheme and seek a private alternative. A private pension plan would almost certainly cost much more in terms of contributions - requiring around one third of salary in contributions to achieve the same level of benefit - without any certainty over final income at retirement. And the current employer contribution to teachers’ pensions - 14.1 per cent - is much more generous than they would be likely to get in the private sector. Only one in three workers in the private sector receive an employer contribution, compared with all teachers - and nearly nine in ten in the public sector overall. Some teachers - including head teachers - have contemplated leaving the profession early because they are concerned by one of the central changes needed to keep the scheme sustainable. We plan to link future benefits to the average salary earned over a lifetime, rather than the absolutely final salary on retirement. It makes the teachers’ pension scheme fairer to all teachers - and, as I say, is critical to making it sustainable. But I understand the concerns expressed and we are cushioning this change. The move to paying retirement income based on the average salary over scheme will only apply to service from the date of the change to a new scheme. Teachers will keep all the benefits they have built up in their current pension, and those benefits will still be based on final salary at retirement. So if a teacher retires before the changes, they would actually get a lower pension than they would if they continued to contribute to the scheme. Ready to be flexible - but determined on reform Of course some have taken issue with this reform. That is why we are still in negotiation. So we can ensure that concerns are heeded and our offer, if necessary, adjusted. But let me make clear. If we are more flexible or generous in one part of the scheme, the weight will have to be borne elsewhere in the scheme. There is no magic pot of gold we can plunder to add huge sums to what we have offered. I have already secured more from the Treasury. There is now a need for all of us to move to agreement. Because we have already had an analysis of the sustainability of our commitments from Lord Hutton - an evaluation of our public sector pensions including the teachers pension scheme - and he has made it clear they are sustainable only with reform. As Lord Hutton made crystal clear, the increases in life expectancy and growing numbers of teacher pensioners are putting a growing strain on other taxpayers. The TPS, like most public service pension schemes, is an unfunded scheme. This means that current pension contributions, both from employees and employers, are used to help offset the cost of paying pensions to current pensioners. But the amount teachers and employers pay together isn’t enough to pay pensions to all current pensioners. And without reform it certainly won’t be enough to support future pensioners. The shortfall between contributions received and pensions paid each year is met from taxes paid by all workers. In 2005/6 it cost £5 billion to pay teachers’ pensions. By 2015/16 the cost will have risen to £10 billion. So reform is vital if we’re to be fair to other taxpayers. But in order to ensure that reform is fair to all, we’ve deliberately sought to share the burden in a way that offers the greatest protection to the lowest paid. That’s why we’ve tried to manage the increase in contributions next year in as fair a way as possible. Following an extensive consultation with the Unions and others, we’ve set out a process which reduces the impact on the relatively lower paid. There will be an average contribution increase by 2015 of 3.2 per cent of a teacher’s salary in order to reinstate a fairer balance between members’ and employers’ contributions. But teachers earning between £26,000 and £32,000 will only pay an extra 0.9 per cent in 2012/13. It is higher earners who will pay up to an additional 2.4 per cent according to their salary. Teachers will continue to receive tax relief on pension contributions, which will reduce the impact of this on their take-home pay. The decision to strike Reform must come. We are all living longer. It is unfair and unrealistic to expect other taxpayers to cover more and more of that cost and bear more and more of the risk. The burden must be shared. At a time when all taxpayers face unprecedented pressure, we have to be fair to all, and we have to continue to prioritise investment in the frontline. This week’s strikes will not change any of these facts. They will not make the tough decisions any easier. But they will force tens of thousands of parents to scrabble around for emergency childcare or plead with their bosses for a day off. And they will deprive children of a day’s schooling. I must warn parents that many schools are going to close. The overwhelming majority across the country. North of 90 per cent. But while I am deeply opposed to this action, and the damage it generates, I don’t want any rancour to enter this debate and I don’t want to see the professional respect in which teachers are held undermined. So let me stress that I understand why teachers value good pensions and appreciate that concern about the future goes right across the workforce - that’s why I got extra money from the Treasury. And let me underline that I want talks to carry on the day after the strike in a constructive way - agreement is too important. I also know that there will be many teachers and heads who are deeply conflicted, who - whatever they think about the pension proposals - don’t like the idea of striking and only do so reluctantly because they do not wish to let down other colleagues. I understand. And I particularly understand that many schools will have to close when the headteacher wants to keep them open. The sheer number of those striking - including support staff - means there aren’t enough bodies physically to keep the school open. There are many fantastic heads working incredibly hard to keep their schools open. No head should be criticised if they have to close their school. It’s a professional judgement we should leave to the professionals. But I still hope that teachers will pause and reflect over the next two days. This is a good deal - one that millions in the private sector envy. This is a difficult time - when we all have to reflect on the fact that we’re all in this together. The success of school reform is increasing the respect, and securing the resources, teachers deserve. So before striking, reflect: what further will be achieved? The Government can’t afford to abandon the path of reform. Everyone would pay the price. Strikes will not change that. I do not blame Union leaders for negotiating hard on behalf of their members. That’s absolutely right. But there comes a point where we’ve got to recognise that they’re no longer serving their members’ best interests if they go out on strike - and I believe that’s the case here. So I hope that many people will decide not to strike. But I also hope that on Thursday morning, those who did strike will reflect; think again about our offer; and come to the conclusion that it is indeed a good deal. Because if we don’t reach agreement then change will have to be imposed. The reason I am in this job is because I want to ensure we give the next generation the best possible start in life. It would be wrong to saddle them with increasing public sector debts, unsustainable financial commitments and unaffordable future promises. That is why, on reform - in our schools, in our economy, in our public finances - there can be no turning back."
/government/publications/listening-to-childrens-perspectives-improving-the-quality-of-provision-in-early-years-settings,"Early years professional status ( EYPS ) was part of a range of measures to develop a more professional early years workforce that would raise the status of work with pre-school children. It was also linked to other quality improvement efforts in the sector such as the implementation of the early years foundation stage. The longitudinal study of early years professional status was a 3-year study commissioned by the former Children’s Workforce Development Council ( CWDC ) in 2009. The study consisted of a national questionnaire survey of early years professionals and case studies of 30 early years settings in which early years professionals from different backgrounds and with different levels of experience were employed in a range of leadership roles."

/government/speeches/elizabeth-truss-speaks-at-the-policy-exchange-on-childcare,"Thank you very much Lucy[1]. It is always a pleasure to attend an event at Policy Exchange, and I congratulate you on your typically rigorous and informative report on childcare. You make a number of highly pertinent observations, not least in highlighting how much quality varies across the country and especially between richer and poorer areas. You are also absolutely right to stress that making it easier for parents - and mothers in particular - to be able to combine family with work matters enormously - to them as individuals, to families, and to the wider economy. Many mothers want to stay at home and of course we are fully supportive of that. It is simply that my job is to help make sure that they have a genuine choice. Much of the debate about childcare provision centres on cost. Of course this has a massive impact - many parents feel that childcare is so expensive that they cannot afford to work at all, let alone build a career. I am determined to address this, and will have a lot more to say on the matter soon. But today I want to outline our vision for early years childcare - and specifically to talk about quality, which is every bit as important as cost and which we ignore at our peril. Or, to quote the title of our paper published today, ‘More great childcare’. It is partly our response to Professor Cathy Nutbrown’s Foundations for Quality , which looked in detail at the qualifications regime for the early education and childcare workforce. It also addresses some of the structural issues in the childcare system, because before making fresh demands on resources we need to make sure every penny parents and governments spend is used effectively. This morning I visited the superb nursery at Durand Academy in Lambeth - a brilliant educational establishment that shows that the most effective institutions are every bit as life-changing as the worst ones. By driving up standards and focusing on quality, I want every child in the country to be given the sort of early education I saw this morning - and the best possible start in life. The critical importance of early years The Jesuits famously said “Give me the child for his first seven years, and I’ll give you the man.” As my colleague Andrea Leadsom has observed, science now suggests that the Jesuits may have been significantly overestimating. As people like Baroness Greenfield - Professor of Synaptic Pharmacology at Oxford - have made clear, how the brain develops - or fails to develop - in the first few years of a person’s life is utterly critical. It never makes sense to give up on anyone, but the fact is that much of what a child experiences well before the age of seven has an enduring effect on their life chances. Research for the Foundation Years Action Group[2] by academics from UCL, the Institute of Education and Bristol University has laid this out in stark terms. At the age of 15 or 16, English pupils score 492 on the average PISA maths score, compared to 555 in Hong Kong, 562 in Singapore and 600 in Shanghai. Yet the gulf in attainment is evident way before that age. The gap between England and East Asia does not differ between the ages of nine or ten and 15 or 16. It’s already there by five years old. If we look at international comparisons of how many children could complete early numeracy tasks when they started primary school, we see the same countries at the top of that table as we would expect to see when comparing the abilities of adults - countries like Chinese Taipei, Hong Kong and Singapore[3]. So when parents hand their child over to the care of a childminder or nursery they are not just entrusting them with their child’s physical safety; they are also entrusting their child’s brain. It is vital that staff have an adequate vocabulary and numerical ability. The 21st Century will belong to those countries that win the global race for jobs and economic advantage. In order for every adult to fulfil their potential, they need to be properly equipped with essential skills from the very beginning of their lives. A world-class childcare system All of which leads to an inescapable conclusion: childcare in this country must be world-class. Quality is first and foremost about people. No school is better than its teachers. I am grateful to Professor Cathy Nutbrown for all her work in assessing the overall landscape of qualifications for those working in early education and childcare. She has said very clearly that too many people who work with young children are under-qualified and that the system for qualifications is confusing and inadequate, with over 400 different qualifications available. I agree with her. And given what we know about early years development, it is no longer acceptable that childcare professionals are not required to have a GCSE grade C or above in English and maths. Professor Nutbrown says in her report, If we are going to improve the quality of early childhood education and care, we cannot allow individuals to ‘slip through’ without their level 2 English and maths in place. The international context underlines all this. In France, at least 40 per cent of staff in creches must hold a diploma, which demands a three-year, post-16 course. In the Netherlands, certified childcare workers must train for three years post-18. Childcare professionals in Denmark need three to five years of vocational or tertiary education before they can work with children in their early years. These and other countries recognise that looking after children is an extremely important job - and that attitude is reflected in higher levels of skills and pay. Contrastingly, Professor Nutbrown’s report raises serious concerns about the quality of training and qualifications in this country. In her interim report, Professor Nutbrown wrote: The ‘hair or care’ stereotype still exists for many considering a course in the early years; yet many other sectors have raised their expectations in relation to enrolment. It must be a cause for concern that early years courses are often the easiest to enrol on and the courses that the students with the poorest academic records are sometimes steered towards[4]. The interim report quotes Helen Perkins, Head of Early Years and Childhood Studies at Solihull College, who said: We demand that students need a relevant level 2 qualification before they are able to handle animals independently on our animal care courses at Solihull College. Nobody demands the same level of qualification before you can be left alone with a baby[5]. Plainly this trend is both extremely worrying and insupportable. I want a high-quality, highly qualified workforce here too. I want their work to be underpinned by effective regulation and inspection that targets support where it’s most needed - but I also want them to be trusted to use their professional judgement and experience. We won’t get where we want to be overnight, but we are moving in the right direction on quality and qualifications. But we cannot overlook the fact that the commitment to make further improvements means giving providers the headroom to pay higher salaries. I also want to be clearer to nurseries and parents about what these qualifications are and what they mean. So we will introduce graduate-level Early Years Teachers specifically trained to teach young children. The Effective Provision of Pre-School Education Project - known as the EPPE report - showed that children make much better progress in pre-school centres where trained teachers are present[6]. We will also seek more crossover between primary school teachers into early years and early years teachers into primary. There have been strong and persuasive calls to bring back the Nursery Nurse Diploma, and we will create early years educators, backed by improved level 3 qualifications. This will offer strong practical experience and require candidates to have at least a C grade in English and maths GCSE. In order to improve this we have to attract people into the profession. Too many make it through sheer dedication, finding it to be a terrific slog. I am convinced that this will be tough given existing wage levels. Staff in this country earn about £6.60 an hour on average, only a little above the minimum wage. This speaks volumes for how much those working in the early years have hitherto been valued. But there is further to go, and we have learned from other countries that deliver better value and better quality childcare. We have looked across Europe and beyond. The aim is not to replicate another country’s approach but to learn from and apply best practice. I have been struck by the high status and trust afforded to childcare professionals in continental Europe. In particular, I am impressed by much of what happens in France. The well-established system of ecoles maternelles is being expanded to offer spaces for more 2-year-olds, while a mixture of creche and childminder provision is in high demand for younger children. Many French families put down their child’s name for a French creche as soon as they discover they are pregnant. Nursery workers are paid around £16,000, compared to about £13,000 here. In return, candidates are expected to have higher qualifications. We are at the bottom of the league table of our near neighbours. Inspired by examples like Durand Academy, I want far more schools to offer childcare and early years education. We will facilitate this by abolishing the requirement on schools to register separately with Ofsted if they want to provide for children under the age of three. And we will reform the burdensome statutory processes schools must follow if they want to take younger children. I hope that some schools will want to run childminder agencies, which would allow well-qualified childminders to offer both group-based and home-based care and to employ their teaching expertise. This will have the added benefit of allowing children to engage with school early. Being able to take children to the same place will make life more convenient for many families too. Greater flexibility for professionals It is telling that I am often asked whether I would be able to look after a certain number of children. I think this line of thinking betrays an attitude that “anyone can do the job”. I don’t start from the premise that anyone can be an early educator. It is an extremely demanding job that requires great and specific expertise. I am not trained to do the job. I am equally sure I would not be able to walk into a class of 30 fourteen-year-olds and teach them German. My ministerial colleagues at the Department of Health don’t get asked if they would be willing to perform keyhole surgery. Those at the MoD aren’t asked if they would fancy hopping on a helicopter and going into battle. Although I suspect that Andrew Robathan and Mark Francois would be up for that. Working in early education isn’t for everyone. Those who do it well are special - and they deserve our thanks. It is a professional career. Other European countries have taken a different approach on ratios. They think that the quality of staff is the most important thing. Whereas in England nursery staff may look after no more than four two-year-olds, in France they can be responsible for eight - and there are no limits in Denmark, Germany or Sweden. That is why we are encouraging nurseries to use their professional judgement and enjoy greater flexibility. Where there is an Early Years Educator leading a group of children, we plan to allow ratios for two-year-olds to rise from four children per adult to six children per adult. And for ones-and-under to rise from three children per adult to four children per adult. We are not changing the ratios for three and four-year-olds but we would like to see more nurseries in the private and voluntary sector using the full allowance of 1:13 with a teacher to have traditional-style nursery classes. Many of our leading providers are successfully delivering this model, including Durand Academy. We think teacher-led groups with structured activities are a good thing. Ofsted has made it clear to me that they do too and want to see evidence of well qualified staff engaging directly with children. Of course parents may demand other learning styles but I think it is important that parents have the choice of this model that works well. We also want to see parents have the choice of more structured group care for their two year olds like the French creche system. These groups would be led by qualified Early Years Educators. We know two is a crucial age where children are learning the structure of language and vocabulary. We are hardwired to be inquisitive, to want to learn and to take pleasure from learning. Think about the joy on a toddler’s face when they take their first steps, or how proud a four-year-old is when they earnestly tell you what the French word for “yes” is. I totally reject the idea that children in a nursery can either have an educational day or an enjoyable one. Ros Marshall of Kids Unlimited has proved that this is bunk. She does outstanding work, for example in encouraging children to learn how to count when they are playing musical instruments. Far from killing any pleasure that a child might get out of learning, structure and clear guidelines provide reassurance and safety. Rather than crushing spontaneity and discovery, they offer an essential framework for precisely those things. This is fully compatible with the EYFS . My insistence that children are well-educated from the very beginning of their lives isn’t just about getting ahead in the global race - crucial though that is. It is a recognition that children’s lives should be complete and fulfilled. This is not just about the economy - it is also about personal happiness. We also want to see more options for home-based care. We have seen a decrease in the number of childminders over recent years - this is, in part, because childminders have to be business owners as well as child carers. When setting up, this means registering with Ofsted, the local authority, finding training, marketing the service to parents and collecting fees. As well as the role of caring for and educating young children, there is a lot of paperwork, administration, chasing up parents for payments and jumping through hoops set by local authorities involved. Some people want a simpler way to enter the profession. So we are setting up “one stop shops” called childminder agencies to do the practicalities. This will mean someone interested in becoming a childminder can go to a local agency, have their premises checked out, receive training and be approved all by a single organisation which itself will be regulated by Ofsted. This agency will deal with the government funding, market services, place children and collect fees from parents. Similar organisations in France and the Netherlands have created a good entry route for childminders, meaning that there are many more childminders relative to population size than there are in England. These measures coupled with the removal of hoops to jump through from local authorities to receive Government funding should see a revival in this important form of care. This will be particularly important for parents in rural areas who have a lack of facilities nearby, for those who are working shifts or irregular hours (like MPs!) who are looking for flexible, home-based childcare. And what’s more, agencies will be able to offer cover if a childminder is on holiday or ill. And we have all been in those situations where childcare arrangements have fallen through at the last minute. Mine normally involves a phone call to my parents in Leeds. We also want to give childminders more flexibility. At present the ratio of one child under the age of one per childminder means that twins are a no-no without special permission. The limit for under-fives is three children - which is fewer than many families have to cope with. This gives rise to the situation I saw where two qualified childminders are looking after six children between them, where if they need a pint of milk one of them has to drag three children to the shop to comply with the rules. In France a childminder can look after up to four children under five. In Denmark they can look after five. There are no ratios in Sweden. We will bring our rules in line with France so that childminders can look after up to four under-fives of which no more than two are under one. This is of course a maximum not a requirement and we would expect childminders to do what they or their agency are comfortable with. We will also give flexibility on changeovers. This will help parents too. If one person is late picking up their child, another parent will not have to wait because the childminder isn’t allowed to look after two children even for a few minutes. Rigorous and fair inspections It is vital that the inspection and regulatory regime is rigorous, comprehensive, clearly understood and fair. It must focus solely on what matters and not distract providers from looking after children. We are working with Ofsted to implement further improvements to the current regime including increasing the number of HMIs covering the early years and to concentrate inspection on those weaker providers that need the most attention. Ofsted alone will be the arbiter of quality. At the moment, local authorities also check the quality of provision, which is both a waste of resources and creates extra barriers for new providers trying to set up. Although we fund three and four-year-old places at £2,200 per head which is enough to cover the costs to nurseries, not enough of this money is reaching the frontline. Local authorities retain £160 million annually of the funding intended to deliver early education to three and four-year-olds, some of which is spent on duplicating work Ofsted is already doing. Ending this situation will mean that as much money as possible goes to the front line. Our commitment to a fair regime is such that we have heeded calls from those who asked for a new route allowing paid-for re-inspection. If a nursery that received a satisfactory rating has taken steps to reach good or outstanding, I want this to be recognised and updated swiftly. Lifelong learning applies to the very young as well as the very old Professionals should also be given the chance to think creatively about how they help children to learn. Better qualified staff will be better able to do that. For some years now politicians have stressed the importance of “lifelong learning”. But the term tends to be used to remind us that a person’s education shouldn’t end when they leave school or university. I believe that learning should be genuinely lifelong - which means that it should start from the moment a child enters the world. We know that the first few years of our life shape the development of our brains. The evidence is clear that qualified teachers are best placed to offer strong developmental learning. Therefore we need to increase the number of teachers involved with the early years. This is all part of our efforts to increase the quality of teaching across the piece for all ages. Conclusion We will shortly publish the report by our commission on childcare, looking at ways to tackle the high costs for parents and to get better value for money. The status-quo is neither fair to providers nor allows enough money to reach the front line. I appreciate your patience in waiting to hear more about this. Getting the funding right is a necessary condition of providing world-class childcare but it is not sufficient. It is not good enough to carry on with an unreformed system. A greater focus on quality and value for money matters enormously as well. Some children enjoy more advantages than others, but all children are vulnerable. Of course parents want their child to have the very best start in life possible. I want every child to spend their early years learning, exploring, enjoying and growing - and for them to arrive at primary school well-prepared and confident. By driving up standards right across early education, we can give parents the sense of security they crave and every child the care and attention they need.

/government/speeches/education-secretary-michael-goves-speech-to-brighton-college,"A coalition for good - how we can all work together to make opportunity more equal What makes a good school? Thank you for that kind introduction. And thank you Richard [Cairns] for inviting me here today. It is one of the many pleasures of being Education Secretary that I get to visit outstanding schools ever week - and am constantly impressed by the amazing work of so many inspirational teachers. We have thousands of superb state schools - some of the very best in the world. And we have hundreds of superlative independent schools - collectively the best independent schools sector in the world. And given the quality of the competition, it is a wonderful accolade for Brighton College to be named UK Independent School of the year. Wonderful, but not surprising. Because those of us who know Richard (Cairns) recognise that he is one of the most visionary leaders in education today… Brighton College’s improvement in the last few years has been breathtaking. Moving from 147th in the Sunday Times league tables in 2006, to 18th this year; the highest-ranking coeducational school in the country, described by the judges as “one of the powerhouses of the independent sector.” And Richard has done what every school leader determined to secure excellence should do. He’s been a curriculum innovator. He’s introduced Mandarin Chinese as a compulsory subject until Year 9. And he’s made narrative history, locational geography and the great canon of English literature compelling for a new generation of students with a wonderfully inspiring introduction into the glories of our island story. He recognises that nothing matters more than improving the quality of teaching. Over the last six years, Brighton College has aggressively recruited, and generously remunerated, talented individuals from a range of backgrounds, in order to boast, in Richard’s words, “the best teachers in the land”. He’s been ambitious to spread excellence beyond his own school. Richard has expanded Brighton College’s reach by taking over other schools, enabling hundreds more children to benefit from Brighton’s unique and award-winning recipe for success. And, above all, Richard has combined an unflinching focus on academic standards with a deeply held social mission. As well as expanding scholarship access to this school Richard is leading a consortium of independent schools which are sponsoring a new free school in Newham - the London Academy of Excellence - which will help the poorest students make it to our best universities. Curriculum innovation, investment in great teaching, spreading excellence beyond just one school, demanding higher academic standards, pursuing a social mission to help the most disadvantaged. These virtues - which Brighton College embodies - are the virtues which mark out the best in our education system - and they demonstrate that there is enormous public benefit in a healthy and progressively-led independent school sector. The glittering prizes in gilded hands But, fan as I am of the virtues nurtured here, I can’t help reflecting on some other facts about our society which the excellence of the education offered in our independent schools underlines. It is remarkable how many of the positions of wealth, influence, celebrity and power in our society are held by individuals who were privately educated. Around the Cabinet table - a majority - including myself - were privately educated. Around the Shadow Cabinet table the Deputy Leader, the Shadow Chancellor, the Shadow Business Secretary, the Shadow Olympics Secretary, the Shadow Welsh Secretary and the Shadow Secretary of State for International Development were all educated at independent schools. On the bench of our supreme court, in the precincts of the bar, in our medical schools and university science faculties, at the helm of FTSE 100 companies and in the boardrooms of our banks, independent schools are - how can I best put this - handsomely represented. You might hear some argue that these peaks have been scaled by older alumni of our great independent schools - and things have changed for younger generations. But I fear that is not so. Take sport - where by definition the biggest names are in their teens, twenties and thirties. As Ed Smith, the Tonbridge-educated former England player, and current Times journalist, points out in his wonderful new book “Luck”: Twenty-five years ago, of the 13 players who represented England on a tour of Pakistan, only one had been to a private school. In contrast, over two thirds of the current team are privately educated. You’re 20 times more likely to go on and play for England if you go to private school rather than state school. The composition of the England rugby union team and the British Olympic team reveal the same trend. Of those members of England’s first 15 born in England, more than half were privately educated. And again, half the UK’s gold medallists at the last Olympics were privately educated, compared with seven per cent of the population. It’s not just in sport that the new young stars all have old school ties. It’s in Hollywood, Broadway and on our TV screens. Hugh Laurie, Dominic West, Damian Lewis, Tom Hiddleston and Eddie Redmayne - all old Etonians. One almost feels sorry for Benedict Cumberbatch - a lowly Harrovian - and Dan Stevens - heir to Downton Abbey and old boy of Tonbridge - is practically a street urchin in comparison. If acting is increasingly a stage for public school talent one might have thought that at least comedy or music would be an alternative platform for outsiders. But then - Armando Iannucci, David Baddiel, Michael McIntyre, Jack Whitehall, Miles Jupp, Armstrong from Armstrong and Miller and Mitchell from Mitchell and Webb were all privately educated. 2010’s Mercury Music Prize was a battle between privately educated Laura Marling and privately-educated Marcus Mumford. And from Chris Martin of Coldplay to Tom Chaplin of Keane - popular music is populated by public school boys. Indeed when Keane were playing last Sunday on the Andrew Marr show everyone in that studio - the band, the presenter and the other guests - Lib Dem peer Matthew Oakeshott, Radio 3 Presenter Clemency Burton-Hill and Sarah Sands, editor of the London Evening Standard - were all privately educated. Indeed it’s in the media that the public school stranglehold is strongest. The Chairman of the BBC and its Director-General are public school boys. And it’s not just the Evening Standard which has a privately-educated editor. My old paper The Times is edited by an old boy of St Pauls and its sister paper the Sunday Times by an old Bedfordian. The new editor of the Mail on Sunday is an old Etonian, the editor of the Financial Times is an old Alleynian and the editor of the Guardian is an Old Cranleighan. Indeed the Guardian has been edited by privately educated men for the last 60 years… But then many of our most prominent contemporary radical and activist writers are also privately educated. George Monbiot of the Guardian was at Stowe, Seumas Milne of the Guardian was at Winchester and perhaps the most radical new voice of all –Laurie Penny of the Independent - was educated here at Brighton College. Now I record these achievements not because I wish to either decry the individuals concerned or criticise the schools they attended. Far from it. It is undeniable that the individuals I have named are hugely talented and the schools they attended are premier league institutions. But the sheer scale, the breadth and the depth, of private school dominance of our society points to a deep problem in our country - one we all acknowledge but have still failed to tackle with anything like the radicalism required. The scars of inequality run deep We live in a profoundly unequal society. More than almost any developed nation ours is a country in which your parentage dictates your progress. Those who are born poor are more likely to stay poor and those who inherit privilege are more likely to pass on privilege in England than in any comparable county. For those of us who believe in social justice this stratification and segregation are morally indefensible. And for those of us who want to see greater economic efficiency it is a pointless squandering of our greatest asset - our children - to have so many from poorer backgrounds manifestly not achieving their potential. When more Etonians make it to Oxbridge than boys and girls on benefit then we know we are not making the most of all our nation’s talents. When hundreds of primary schools allow children to leave not able to read, write or add up properly we know we are indulging in a form of national self-harm so profound as to be disabling. Even when disadvantaged children attend schools which perform well overall, they continue to lag behind their wealthier, luckier peers. At Key Stage one - age 7 - the gap between pupils eligible for free school meals and their peers is already 11 percentage points in maths. At Key Stage two 58 per cent of pupils known to be eligible for free school meals achieved the expected level in both English and mathematics compared with 78 per cent of all other pupils. Then at GCSE - while results go up every year there remains a stubborn and unchanging gap in achievement between the number of disadvantaged pupils who achieved five A* to C GCSEs (including maths and English), and the rest of the population. Look at the number securing GCSEs in the subjects which the best universities and employers value and the picture is even bleaker. 17 per cent of pupils achieved the English Baccalaureate - good GCSES in English, Maths, the sciences, a language and a humanities subject - in 2010, but only 8 per cent of pupils eligible for free school meals even took the exams - and only 4 per cent of children eligible for free school meals actually achieved it. Pupils from deprived backgrounds are less than half as likely to go on to study at university as their peers. A recent study by the Sutton Trust indicated that the majority of state secondary school teachers would not encourage gifted students to apply to Oxford and Cambridge. One in five of teachers polled said they would “never” encourage their brightest pupils to apply to Oxbridge - something which I doubt very strongly any teacher in the independent sector would say. All around us, other countries are narrowing and even eradicating the attainment gap. Deprived pupils in Hong Kong and Shanghai, who struggle with challenges far greater and more debilitating than any we know here, achieve as highly as their English peers from the most comfortable homes. Only 24 per cent of disadvantaged students in the UK perform better than expected compared with 76 per cent in Shanghai, 72 per cent in Hong Kong and 46 per cent in Finland. The OECD average is 31 per cent - putting the UK well behind countries like Poland, Greece, Slovenia, Mexico and Chile when it comes to making opportunity more equal. But the tide is being turned Despite the evidence that other nations are closing the gap between rich and poor through great state schooling, some in this country still argue that pupil achievement is overwhelmingly dictated by socio-economic factors. They say that deprivation means destiny - that schools are essentially impotent in the face of overwhelming force of circumstance. And that we can’t expect children to succeed if they have been born into poverty, disability or disadvantage. I simply don’t accept that. Not just because other countries show us what can be done. But because I believe such fatalism in the face of circumstance is a profoundly reactionary doctrine - it denies the possibility of progress through human action, it says to all those driven by idealism to enter the classroom that they are simply spectators in a pageant of futility. And I am encouraged in my conviction by the knowledge that I am not alone - there are a growing number of schools proving that deprivation need not be destiny - that with the right teaching and the right values they can outperform everyone’s expectations. As Dr Kevan Collins, Chief Executive of the Education Endowment Foundation, wrote recently in the Times Educational Supplement: “the real myth is the idea that a school where pupils eligible for free school meals do well must be a one-off, or have only a handful of disadvantaged students.” On the contrary there are more than 440 secondary schools across the country - one in nine - where the average GCSE points score is higher for disadvantaged pupils than it is for all pupils. These schools are scattered all over the country, and all over the spectrum of disadvantage. Some have a higher than average proportion of children with special needs, some have a higher than average number eligible for free school meals, some have a higher than average number who don’t have English as a first language - and yet they all outperform schools with much more favoured intakes in much wealthier areas. What they share is an unwavering, unapologetic focus on standards. Led by inspirational heads and teachers, every day, these schools are proving the pessimists and fatalists wrong. They show us all that there need be no difference in performance - none whatsoever - between pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds and those from wealthier homes. They show us that a difficult start in life can be overcome, with hard work and good teaching. And that it is entirely possible for children to break free of the bonds of poverty and disadvantage, transforming a deprived start into a bright future. If we want more children to enjoy these advantages and opportunities, we have to look at what characterises these successful schools. And the most important lessons will not come as a surprise to you here - the schools which close the attainment gap - like Pimlico Academy, Lampton Academy, the Harris Academy Merton, Wembley High Technology College, Haberdasher’s Askes Hatcham College, Paddington Academy, Burlington Danes Academy, Mossbourne Community Academy, St Marylebone Church of England School and Brighton College’s own partner school Kingsford Community School - do what Brighton College does. They demand high academic standards from every student - with Kingsford introducing all its students to Mandarin, and Burlington Danes ranking students in order by every subject every term to encourage a culture of excellence. They are curriculum innovators with Mossbourne delivering intensive support for students who arrive with poor literacy and Pimlico developing a new core knowledge curriculum modelled on America’s best. They recruit the best teachers - with schools like the Harris Academies training their own. They operate outside their own four walls with Lampton Academy leading the Challenge partnership - a school improvement chain working across the country. And they are all characterised by a sense of burning social mission - with free school meal pupils performing better than their peers in Wembley High and Pimlico. Our reform programme is intended to ensure the virtues which characterise those schools are embedded across the school system. And we start with a relentless focus on overcoming disadvantage. Intervention in the earliest years We are acting across every stage of a child’s life to erode disadvantages of birth and background. With 15 hours of free education for the poorest two-year-olds, A progress check on all children between two and three, 15 hours of free education for all three- and four-year-olds, Better qualified staff in nurseries and other Early Years settings, A more rigorous Foundation Stage curriculum with more emphasis on literacy and numeracy. Opening the joy of reading for every child And - one of the most important interventions of all - starting next month - a check on every six-year-old to make sure they’re on track to read effortlessly. Given that one in six eleven-year-olds is still struggling with reading when they leave primary school we are determined to drive up standards in the crucial skill of early reading. If children can’t learn to read, they can’t read to learn. We are determined to help all children to become fluent and enthusiastic readers, with the life-changing skill of turning words on the page into images, information and ideas. In a few weeks’ time, six-year-olds across the country will be checked to see how well they’ve mastered phonics - the method of teaching reading which has been proven to be most successful with all children, and particularly those from disadvantaged homes. We have been clear that the results for the reading check will not be published in league tables, although schools will be required to tell parents their own child’s results - as parents have welcomed. But last summer’s pilot saw only 32 per cent of children reaching the level which their teachers decided was appropriate - fewer than a third. By monitoring pupil progress at an early stage, the check will help teachers to identify those who need extra help and ensure that they don’t fall behind - indeed, almost half of schools in the pilot said the check identified pupils with reading difficulties of which they were not previously aware. We’ve offered match-funding to help schools buy high-quality systematic synthetic phonics resources and training from a new, approved catalogue. Phonics and reading are becoming a key part of the new Ofsted inspection framework, with Ofsted inspectors listening to weaker readers as part of every primary school inspection. From September, a thorough understanding of the teaching of systematic synthetic phonics will be prioritised in teacher training and required for all teachers of early reading. And we’re introducing a reading competition to encourage all children to read widely and well, instilling the habit of regular reading for pleasure at an early age. Shockingly, a survey by the National Literacy Trust last year showed that a third of children do not own a single book, while two in five pupils in England never read for enjoyment. The pace never slackens We will ensure progress is maintained. We have introduced a tough new primary school floor standard - meaning that a school will fall below the floor when fewer than 60 per cent of pupils achieve the ‘basics’ standard in both English and mathematics and fewer pupils than average make the expected levels of progress between Key Stage 1 and Key Stage 2. At the moment, there are 1310 primaries below this floor - mostly those in poorer areas. 200 of the worst performing primary schools will convert to academy status with a strong sponsor, reopening in 2012. And we’re aiming for academy status for hundreds more primary schools that have been below the floor for the last three years, ensuring all children get the high quality education they have a right to expect. And for those schools which are stuck in mediocrity a tough new inspections framework will ensure they are held accountable for a failure to get children making progress. There’s been some criticism recently of the new inspections framework and the new chief inspector. I’ve listened to that criticism - I’ve considered carefully the arguments made - and I have to say on reflection - it’s misdirected at best, mischievous at worst. Sir Michael Wilshaw is a visionary school leader who has spent his career in the state sector and has achieved amazing results for children from the poorest homes - when his critics achieve results like him, then I’ll believe their arguments carry the same weight as his experience. He is determined to improve inspection, drive up standards, encourage great teaching and celebrate good leadership - he deserves the backing of everyone who wants children to succeed - and I shall do everything to ensure that whatever he wants - he gets. Higher expectations for all Because the whole point of education is to engage in a restless reach for self-improvement - and all too often, children have been let down by a failure to ensure they are stretched to the utmost. That’s why we are increasing the number of specialist maths teachers, including prioritising places on primary ITT courses in 2012/13 that offer specialisms in mathematics. And why we have accepted Lord Bew’s recommendation to assess spelling, punctuation, grammar and vocabulary as part of the writing test at Key Stage 2. And at secondary: We’ve introduced the English Baccalaureate to encourage more pupils to study the essential, core academic subjects prized by universities and employers. In 2011, there were over 150 maintained mainstream schools where not a single pupil - not one - was entered for all the EBacc subjects. I would hazard a guess that it would be hard to find more than a few private schools which would say the same. In a world where disadvantaged children are all too often barred from elite universities because they don’t know or aren’t told which qualifications they will need, the EBacc’s unequivocal statement of priority is the single greatest aid we have in widening access to elite universities. And I’m delighted to say that we’re already seeing numbers climbing. From 23 per cent of pupils entering the EBacc combination of subjects in 2011, the proportion has climbed to 47 per cent in 2013 - and hopefully will continue on this upward trajectory, higher and steeper still. Time spent on teaching history, geography and modern languages has risen by 10 per cent. In 2011 there were around 3400 more teachers teaching in these subjects and an increase of 23,000 teaching hours on the previous year. In languages, for example, the number of pupils set to sit language GCSEs next year has increased by 22 per cent to 52 per cent. Highly able pupils attending the most disadvantaged schools are also 10 times more likely to take a vocational qualification than those in wealthier areas. Building on the Wolf Review, we’re making sure that vocational qualifications up to 16 are rigorous and well-respected - and ensuring that vocational qualifications after 16 offer students a high-quality route into employment or further study. Qualifications must be externally assessed and must enable progression to a wide range of study and employment opportunities. Vocational qualifications are hugely important, and will continue to be so - so we are working hard to ensure that they are just as ambitious and useful as academic courses. At A Level, Ofqual admits that more than a decade of “persistent grade inflation” which was “impossible to justify” has undermined A levels and GCSEs, we’ve invited top academics and university lecturers to get involved in raising standards and making examinations more rigorous. And we’ve allowed further education lecturers into schools to share their expertise and experience with as wide a pool of students as possible. And to ensure the money is there to help accelerate progress in closing that gap, we’ve introduced the Pupil Premium to support disadvantaged pupils, allowing schools to decide how funding is used to answer their pupils’ needs. Independent schools succeed because leaders give a clear and consistent message about the values of their institution - and every message the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister send to the school system is about one thing - making opportunity more equal. But independent schools also succeed because as well as setting high expectations - and sending a clear message about values - they encourage professionals to take responsibility for what happens in their classrooms - to innovate in pursuit of excellence. Freedom to concentrate on what matters And that’s why we’ve given all schools greater freedoms to meet the standards we expect. Greater freedoms over the school day, week and year; freedom from excessive, centrally-generated bureaucracy and overwhelming government guidance; freedom to decide who to hire, to get involved in ITT and to devise their own CPD; and greater autonomy in tackling poor pupil behaviour, taking a sensible approach to exclusions and keeping order in the classroom. And, of course, we’ve invited schools to gain greater independence within the state sector by becoming academies. Already, over half of all secondary schools are open or in the process of opening as academies, teaching over one and a half million children. During March more than 140 schools applied for academy status (the highest rate since May last year) and every month, now, more primaries than secondaries are applying to convert. In some parts of the country, more than half of all secondary schools are now academies. In some local areas, it’s almost every secondary school. And these freedoms are already making a difference. Evidence shows that sponsored academies are improving at twice the rate of other schools, and have been doing so for a decade. Across the whole Academies programme, rigorous research from the National Audit Office has shown that the attainment rate for FSM pupils in academies improved by 8.3 percentage points between 2009 and 2010 - almost double the national improvement rate for FSM pupils, 4.6 percentage points. In other words, the best academies are driving up standards for those children who have the worst start in life almost twice as quickly as other schools. And they’re doing it by giving great heads in the state system the freedom you have in the independent sector - to concentrate on education not bureaucracy. To take one minor but telling example: one head recently told my Department that since becoming an academy his senior staff have saved 43 days a year previously spent in “irrelevant” local authority meetings. As well as converting and sponsored academies, Free Schools are being established and driving social mobility, particularly in areas where deprivation is high and parents are crying out for new schools - brilliant centres of innovation like King’s Science Academy Bradford, The London Academy of Excellence, West London Free School and Norwich Free School. Evidence from America has shown that new schools can bring dramatic improvements in school standards, especially schools for poorer children in poor areas. And true to form, over a third of the 2011 Free School openers are located in the 20 per cent most deprived areas of the country - half in the 30 per cent most deprived areas. Although it is too early to confirm, the majority of the groups seeking to open a Free School in 2012 or later have proposed sites which are in the 50 per cent most deprived areas of the country. Beyond all these structural changes, we’re concentrating on the staff who bring schools to life. The importance of teaching Richard’s single-minded focus on high-quality teaching at Brighton was rightly singled out by Sunday Times judges as one of the factors in this school’s meteoric success. And the recent report on social mobility from the all-party-parliamentary group found that teacher quality is not only the number one factor in educational outcomes, it’s the number one factor in narrowing the gap between rich and poor. One study from the US found that effective teaching can make a difference of a whole additional year of progress to poor pupils. Yet schools where more than 20 per cent of pupils are eligible for free school meals are more likely to be rated worse in their teaching, and their teachers are less likely to have come from an outstanding teacher training institution. Through the new network of 200 Teaching Schools and over 600 National Leaders of Education, we’re giving the teaching profession far greater autonomy over school improvement, recruitment, ITT and CPD, nurturing talent in the next generation of teachers and sharing best practice between schools. We’ve already designated 1000 Specialist Leaders of Education, testament to the prodigious teaching and leadership talent already working in schools today, and we’re providing incentives for the brightest and best graduates to enter the classroom. We’re targeting these incentives particularly at the crucial subjects of Maths and Sciences - all the more important when more than half of newly qualified maths teachers don’t have a degree in maths. Nothing, but nothing, is more important than the quality of teaching. Conclusion As you will appreciate, this Government is neither idle nor complacent in the face of the inequality which scars our society. And that is because we know that progress - for individuals or society - is not a matter of laissez-faire but leadership. And because we recognise that Governments must take sides in debates - we must be for aspiration, ambition, hard work and excellence - for success based on merit and a celebration of those who do succeed. How will we know if we’ve succeeded - well success may be decided by events far beyond this parliament - will we, for example, ever see a comprehensive boy or girl ever edit the Guardian? Perhaps not in my lifetime… But - seriously - we know we are making progress when we hear the opposition from vested interests - from those in trade unions who put adults interests before children’s, from those in local Government who put protecting their power before fulfilling children’s potential, from those who have acquiesced in a culture of low expectations who resist any form of accountability for failure. That opposition is out there - entrenched, organised, vocal and determined - and it is hoping we in the Coalition Government fail - but if we fail then so do thousands more of our poorest children - and we cannot let that happen."

/government/news/100-million-to-expand-early-education-and-childcare,"The money will be used to support new nurseries and childminders in getting established, as well as helping existing providers to create and provide additional places. The Government will extend free childcare to 130,000 of the most disadvantaged two-year-olds from September 2013, rising to around 260,000 (40 per cent of all two-year-olds) in September 2014. Children from disadvantaged backgrounds are known to be more at risk of poor development, with evidence showing that differences by social background emerge early on in life. High quality early education can make a difference to a child’s progress and the additional Government money will help to make sure children from poorer families do not lose out. Nick Clegg, Deputy Prime Minister, said: Every child should have a fair chance from the word go. High quality early education can make a huge difference to children at the start of their lives. By getting things right from the off, they are much more likely to be ready to learn when they start school and to get the most out of their lives. “It’s important we put the support in place to ensure nurseries and other childcare providers can supply thousands of additional free places, so that children can reap the benefits.” The £100m will be allocated to local authorities across England. The free childcare entitlement for two-year-olds has already rolled out early in 10 pilot areas this September. Currently, more than 850,000 three and four year olds nationally access up to 15 hours of free early education every week. Notes to editors A breakdown of the number of children that it is estimated will be eligible for free places in each local authority is on the Department for Education website .  The 10 pilot areas trialling the free two-year-old entitlement are: Blackpool, Cornwall, Greenwich, Kent, Lambeth, Lancashire, Newcastle, Northamptonshire, Peterborough and Rotherham."

/government/speeches/edward-timpson-addresses-cdc-annual-conference,"A little more than a year on from the special educational needs and disability ( SEND ) reforms coming into force, today’s conference is an opportune moment to pause for reflection, take stock, check we’re on track, and look ahead to make sure we’re confident of securing the transformation and culture change set out in that initial vision. And in doing so we should remind ourselves what we’re trying to fix and why. Why are these reforms necessary? Well, let me give you 3 good reasons: First, for too long, too many families have had to fight too hard to get the support their children need. They feel the system doesn’t work for them. Second, it remains the case that children and young people with SEND don’t do as well in early years and school as they should, and don’t have as many opportunities for further education, training and employment as they deserve. Third, the law, and the systems that existed - at national and local level - didn’t encourage education, health and social care agencies to work together for the benefit of the children and families in need of their support. The incentives weren’t there, let alone the clear legal duties to make it happen. Things had to get better. So we’ve made fundamental changes to the law. But in doing so, we must also make changes to systems so the tide they create flows with families and not against them. And, for some, the reforms also mean changes to attitudes and mindsets. After all, any system is only as good as the people working within it. Only if we do all of these things, in tandem with one another, will we make real and lasting improvements. That’s why, from my perspective, it has been so emboldening to meet so many people who work hard, and show real commitment, to improving the lives of all children and young people with special educational needs and disabilities. And I’m in no doubt that it’s because of that commitment that there’s widespread support for the reforms that are quintessentially about realising the ambitions and aspirations for disabled children and young people and those with special educational needs. But in setting out to achieve just that, we also need to recognise that despite our collective impatience to ‘get on with it’, these reforms will take a while to embed. Yet with continued support - and challenge - and with the voices of parents, children and young people at the heart of service delivery, I’m confident we will continue to see changes which empower, support and enable children and young people reach their full potential. So it’s only right that I use this opportunity to register how grateful I am for all of the enormous effort so many people have put in to make the changes work. It’s been impressive to see and hear about the progress being made in many areas - the leadership that local authorities have shown, the genuine co-production with parent-carer forums that exists, and how young people are being engaged. I’m also hugely appreciative of organisations, like CDC , Contact a Family, IPSEA , Nasen, the LGA and many others, for the way they’ve provided constructive challenge along the way. And for the support, advice and leadership they continue to give. I think it’s fair to say that some aspects of the reforms are a natural progression - in essence, getting better at what we already do. And some require us to operate differently. For example, designing support around the needs of families was always how it was supposed to work (and sometimes did, but not nearly enough). Agencies working together, sharing information, joining up - that’s not new. The duty to make sure families have access to impartial information, advice and support has been with us for years. But the reforms also introduced EHC plans, local offers and new arrangements for 16- to 25-year-olds because it’s critical that families are properly and genuinely involved in designing how these things are developed and implemented locally. And although not all those barriers, system joins, communication vacuums and duplications of effort have disappeared, I urge you to keep at it because the rewards will be worth it. When systems work well - and perhaps more importantly, people across the systems drive a collective improvement in the quality of assessment, planning and delivery - they make a real difference to children and young people. Some of you may know Corey, who is here with us today and taking part in a workshop later on. Corey’s a member of EPIC , a young people’s group we’ve been working with for a few years now and who’s been immensely valuable in helping shape these reforms by telling us how it is, no holds barred. I think Corey puts it well when he said: The SEND reforms aim to create a more fluid and inclusive system of support for me and people like me, but it will take time, patience and resources. And in an event about vision, it’s only fitting that I offer you mine. It’s one I hope you share. In simplistic terms, it is this. Our vision for children with SEN and disabilities is the same as that for all children and young people - that they achieve well in their early years, at school and in college, that they find employment; lead happy and fulfilled lives; and experience choice and control. A vision is one thing, but it’s imperative that we keep measuring ourselves against it to really understand whether it’s taking hold. So, how are we doing? The headline facts, I think, are these: all areas are well on with implementing the reforms they all have transition plans in place and are making progress they all have a local offer, although there is still work to do to improve their quality and local co-production arrangements. Where real thought, creativity and co-operation has flourished, it’s had great results. Take the good example of a strong local offer in the Isle of Wight, for instance. They set up a Young Inspector programme to increase the involvement children and young people with disabilities and additional needs, and these young inspectors have gone on to make a significant contribution to the Isle of Wight’s local offer. Parent-carer forums and ‘independent supporters’ are up and running in every area. And it’s great to see so many forums actively shaping implementation in their local area. In June, a survey of parent-carer forums said that 67% were very, or extremely, well engaged. 67% is good. 100% would be of course much better, but it’s encouraging all the same. And 90% of parents and young people who had help from an independent supporter said it was very useful, a clear justification for their introduction to help the reforms bite and enable families to be - and feel - much better supported through the assessment and planning stages in particular. We’re also seeing some examples of good, new, high-quality practice. Take Ryan, a 14-year-old passionate Coventry City FC fan. He received help from an independent supporter to develop his EHC plan. One of Ryan’s aspirations was to have a personal assistant. He interviewed people for the position and scored them on their answers. The PA - who, I gather, supports the wrong football team but managed to get the job anyway - has made a big difference to Ryan, especially helping to develop his independence. Good for Ryan - but we want to get this right, for every child and young person, so they have the support and education they deserve. For instance, we want to ensure local areas manage the transition from statements and LDAs to EHC plans. We recently changed the deadline for transfers to EHC plans to 20 weeks, to bring them into line with new EHC plans. And I’ll continue to keep an eye on this. We also want to continue to drive up accountability. And as you’ve just heard from Mary Rayner, the forthcoming joint Ofsted and Care Quality Commission local area inspections will help to ensure joined-up working at a local level is a reality, not just a statement in an Act of Parliament. And importantly we’re continuing to work with the Department of Health which has led to them setting up their own virtual forum for CCGs and other health professionals in order to support system reform. We’re also working through parent-carer forums and local authorities to ensure the GP register of learning disability is up to date. All of these are necessary steps, in particular because the refrain I’ve heard more often than any other over the past 3 years is that when it comes to SEND , whether that’s identification, assessment, planning or support, health are the hardest nut to crack. It’s why closer monitoring of health’s role in joint-commissioning, co-production and other areas is going to be so vital as the reforms continue to evolve. We’re also making children and young people’s mental health a priority. Schools play a key role in promoting good mental health and we’ve supported them by funding the PSHE Association to provide guidance on how to teach about mental health. We’ve worked with organisations such as Place2Be to produce guidance on what makes for effective school counselling. And in the Code of Practice we created a new SEN category of social, emotional and mental health, to emphasise the need to look beyond behaviour to underlying mental health issues. To help bring that about, this month sees the start of our joint pilot with NHS England to train single points of contact across 27 CAMHS areas and in more than 250 schools. And we’re investing in children and young people’s mental health services - an additional £1.4 billion over the lifetime of this Parliament - that I’m working closely with my Department of Health colleagues on to ensure that children and young people with special educational needs and disabilities derive real and lasting benefits from. But how do we know whether this is all helping to improve SEND provision, families experience and outcomes for children and young people? Well, we’ve put in a range of measures to find out what’s happening locally and help us to target the national support on offer. We’re conducting termly surveys of local authorities. And in parallel, Contact a Family are conducting surveys of parent-carer forums. We also gather data through, for example, the annual SEN2 data survey of councils to enrich the picture we have to judge progress against We’ve a team of experienced SEN advisers in place, offering local areas support and challenge as well as seeking to resolve issues before they cement themselves as the norm. And through visits, events like this, correspondence and enquiries we pick up a lot about how things are going. I personally garner invaluable knowledge from talking with parents and young people face to face and intend to carry on doing so in the coming months. Because for me it’s their experience that counts most. And in that context, I’ve already mentioned the new Ofsted/ CQC area inspections. As you’ve heard, Ofsted is currently consulting on the framework, and inspections will be introduced next year. So I would strongly encourage you to participate in the consultation because it’s vital that we get the inspection framework right. We’re also looking at disagreement resolution arrangements, trying to make them simpler and clearer. The SEND Tribunal can only look at appeals about special educational provision at the moment but we’re running pilots to test whether we can go further – to allow the Tribunal to make recommendations about health and social care provision. We want to make things as clear and as easy as possible for families to understand, but rather than just assume that’s what’s happening, we’ll be conducting a comprehensive ‘User Experience’ Survey, with results expected next autumn. And over the next few months, we’re laying on workshops across the country to look at Preparing for Adulthood, and EHC plans. And today, I understand, we also have the latest LA and surveys being launched. One of this afternoon’s workshops is considering funding arrangements and how in the future we can make funding fairer by ensuring it’s better matched to need. And the reason for taking all these steps is because, as I said, just over a year ago the new law came into force. Legislating is, in some ways, the easy bit (although it didn’t feel like it at the time) - but implementation is so much harder. And we’re having to do it all at a time when money is tight and expectations have never been higher. It’s why I’m not prepared to put my feet up and say ‘I’ve done my bit, it’s over to you’, because, although we have a fantastic framework on which to build a new 0 to 25 child and family-centred SEND system, it requires determination, humility and a willingness from us all to view everything we do through the eyes of those who should rightly be the beneficiaries of our collective effort - children and young people with special education needs and disabilities. So I’m prepared to keep listening, make adjustments where necessary, but above all, continue to put the case for why the vision set out almost 5 years ago has to be made a reality."

/government/news/phonics-funding-thousands-of-schools-sign-up,"Gibb: Phonics funding for schools to raise reading standards So far 3,211 schools have taken advantage of the Government’s match-funding scheme to buy the products. The products include a range of teaching resources, including books, software and games. Additionally, 987 schools have booked phonics training for their staff (at a total spend of £1.3 million) to improve their teaching of phonics, the method internationally proven to improve reading, especially among younger children. The scheme went ‘live’ in September last year with the publication of the phonics catalogue of approved products and services. Under the scheme, any state-funded school with Key Stage 1 pupils - including Academies and Free Schools - can claim up to £3,000 to buy products and training until March 2013. Schools have signed up to spend £1.66 million on products in the past month alone. The number of schools that have booked phonics training has almost doubled in the same period. But the figures present a mixed picture. Some local authorities - Thurrock, Rochdale, Walsall, Lincolnshire, Windsor and Maidenhead, Plymouth, and Sutton - are leading the way. More than one in three of their schools have already signed up for products. In others, a high number of schools have booked training so their staff can teach phonics as effectively as possible. Two local authorities with reading rates well below the national average at Key Stage 2 - Derby and Coventry - are also among those that have a high proportion of their schools taking advantage of the scheme. But in other areas, including where there is a higher than average proportion of 11-year-olds failing to reach the expected level in reading, there has so far been a low level of take-up of products. These include Central Bedfordshire, Bedford, Hull, Medway, Portsmouth, Luton and Sheffield. And in 20 local authorities, not a single school has booked training for their staff yet. Schools Minister Nick Gibb said: This is a chance for schools to gain extra funding to improve reading standards so I am naturally concerned at the number of areas where few schools have not yet taken the opportunity to do so. The money is available until March next year so there is still time to claim it. But every week that goes by is another week that children are missing out on the best possible teaching of reading. This is an open invitation to all schools to improve the way they teach systematic synthetic phonics - the tried and tested method of improving the reading of all our children, especially the weakest.

One in three six-year-olds reached the expected level in the pilot of the phonics check in the summer of 2011. England is rated 25th in the world for reading, according to the 2009 PISA reading study - down from seventh nine years ago. Our 15-year-olds are judged by PISA to be 18 months behind those in Shanghai and at least six months behind those in Canada, Australia and New Zealand. England was third in the PIRLS international reading tables in 2001. In the most recent 2006 survey, England was 16th. How phonics works Phonics teaches children how to: Recognise the sounds that each individual letter makes; Identify the sounds that different combinations of letters make - such as “sh” or “oo”; and blend these sounds together to make a word. Children can then use this knowledge to ‘de-code’ new words that they see. This is the first important step in learning to read. Research shows that when phonics is taught in a structured way - starting with the easiest sounds, progressing through to the most complex - that it is the most effective way of teaching young children to read. It is particularly helpful for children aged five to seven. Almost all children who have good teaching of phonics will learn the skills they need to tackle new words. They go on to read any kind of text. Most importantly, they will read for enjoyment. They also tend to read more accurately than those taught using other methods, such as ‘look and say’. This includes children who find learning to read difficult, for example those who have dyslexia. Research evidence In Clackmannanshire, Scotland, a seven-year study of the teaching of synthetic phonics to 300 children found they made more progress in reading and spelling than other children their age. In Australia, the committee for the National Inquiry into the Teaching of Literacy produced the report ‘Teaching Reading’ (2005). The committee concluded: ‘The evidence is clear, whether from research, good practice observed in schools, advice from submissions to the Inquiry, consultations […] that direct systematic instruction in phonics during the early years of schooling is an essential foundation for teaching children to read. …systematic phonics instruction is critical if children are to be taught to read well, whether or not they experience reading difficulties. […] Moreover, where there is unsystematic or no phonics instruction, children’s literacy progress is significantly impeded, inhibiting their initial and subsequent growth in reading accuracy, fluency, writing, spelling and comprehension.’ The US National Reading Panel was set up in 2006 to assess the effectiveness of the different approaches used to teach children to read. It was the most comprehensive and detailed survey of this topic ever produced. It said: ‘Systematic synthetic phonics instruction had a positive and significant effect on disabled readers’ reading skills. These children improved substantially in their ability to read words and showed significant, albeit small, gains in their ability to process text as a result of systematic synthetic phonics instruction. This type of phonics instruction benefits both students with learning disabilities and low-achieving students who are not disabled. Moreover, systematic synthetic phonics instruction was significantly more effective in improving low socio-economic status (SES) children’s alphabetic knowledge and word reading skills than instructional approaches that were less focused on these initial reading skills… Across all grade levels, systematic phonics instruction improved the ability of good readers to spell.’ It is important to note that research emphasises the importance of phonics teaching being embedded in a language rich curriculum. Notes to Editors All materials that schools can buy have to meet the Department’s criteria, which can be found on the Department for Educations’s website . The approved list of products and training is in a catalogue to make it easier for schools to select products and training that best meet their requirements and the learning needs of their pupils. It provides schools with a range of products and training that they can choose with the confidence that they all meet the criteria considered essential for good phonics teaching. They can buy whole systematic synthetic phonics programmes or resources to supplement their existing programmes, teachers’ resources, materials for pupils, and training for individual teachers or all the staff. They can also buy materials which will help children who need additional support in reading to catch up. The catalogue is available on the Pro5 website . The US National Reading Panel report published in 2006 is available online . The Schools White Paper, ‘The Importance of Teaching’ , published in November 2010, made a commitment to ensure there is support available to every school for the teaching of systematic synthetic phonics, as the best method for teaching reading, and to provide funding for high-quality training and classroom teaching resources for all schools with Key Stage 1 pupils.

/government/news/parents-overwhelmingly-satisfied-with-free-early-education,"Almost 90% of parents are satisfied with free early education, according to reports published today. The statistics also show that 96% of 3- and 4-year-olds across England are benefiting from free early education. The government has today published ‘Provision for children under five years of age in England: January 2012’ and ‘Childcare and early years survey of parents 2010’. They give a comprehensive view of early education among young children across England, showing the number of funded places for children aged 5 years and under, as well as overall numbers of children who benefit from free early education. The reports show: More than 1,264,000 children benefited from their free entitlement to early education in 2012; Around 40,000 more three- and four-year-olds are benefiting from free early education in 2012, compared with the previous year; Those children who are taking up free entitlement are taking more hours; There are 462 more private and voluntary free early education providers in 2012 compared with the previous year. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said: The right start in life leads to brighter futures. Parents have been crying out for more childcare, and now more than a million 3- and 4-year-olds are benefiting. Today’s figures show that free places are being snapped up - which means huge benefits for families. We’re picking up the pace, rolling out free early education to disadvantaged 2-year-olds in 10 areas from this September, before we do so across the whole country next year. We are revolutionising the early years for the good of future generations. Sarah Teather, Minister for Children and Families, said: Parents value free early education. By the academic year 2014 to 2015 this government will be investing £760 million in free early education for 2-year-olds. Parents know that it gives their child the best possible start in life, and allows them to learn through play and stories. It provides the perfect preparation for school life, and I am delighted that even more young children are gaining through early education. The findings come as the government prepares to roll out free early education to hundreds of 2-year-olds on a trial basis in 10 areas in September. At present all 3- and 4-year-olds are entitled to 15 hours of free early education each week. This will develop further so that 40% of 2-year-olds - more than a quarter-of-a-million - will receive free early education from September 2014. The government is currently undertaking a review of childcare costs. This is looking at the effectiveness of current support, wraparound care, best practice from home and abroad, and the impact of bureaucracy. It is also considering the findings of Professor Cathy Nutbrown’s report, ‘Foundations for quality - the independent review of early education and childcare qualifications’, which looks to enhance quality in the sector. The government will report back on both issues later this year. Note to editors The two statistical publications - ‘Provision for children under five years of age in England: January 2012’ and ‘Childcare and early years survey of parents 2010’ - are available in the research and statistics section.
