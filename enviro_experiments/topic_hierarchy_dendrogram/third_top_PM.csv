/government/news/apha-at-rhs-chelsea-flower-show-2015,"Novel garden at RHS Chelsea 2015 highlights how sentinel trees are being used to detect global plant pest and disease threats. APHA garden at RHS Chelsea Flower Show highlights global pest threats  Animal and Plant Health Agency The garden is called Beyond Our Borders and has been commissioned by the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA). It shows how the UK government is working with overseas botanic gardens to protect our environment against alien pest and diseases. Plant sentinels Iconic British tree species are being used as ‘early warning’ sentinels (soldier or guard) in regions throughout the world to monitor and identify potential new plant pest and diseases that could threaten our natural environment. British trees have been planted in other countries where pests and diseases are present, and are monitored to see what affects the pests and diseases might have on them. Because our native trees do not have natural resistance built up to these threats, they are more likely to be severely affected. The project is designed to establish which pests and diseases post the biggest threat to British species, and this information is used to inform plans for prevention, eradication and control. Garden design In the Fresh Garden section, the eye-catching and innovative display features three different climatic zones (Australasia, Tropical and Arid) divided by water features representing oceans. Each zone contains a single iconic UK native tree sentinel standing among plants native to each climate. Set within the plants of each zone are coloured springs representing plant pest and diseases. These appear to emerge and disappear and some are stretched to create a wave motion over the top of each ocean. This represents the movement of plant pests and diseases within and between each zone, reflecting the threat to plant health. See [InlineAttachment:1] Garden designer Sarah Eberle commented: “The inspiration for the garden came from a new international project, led by the UK, aimed at creating a network of tree sentinels in botanical parks and gardens around the world. “I wanted to illustrate the danger of the transfer of plant pests and diseases across international borders and have done this by using springs to represent the plant pests and diseases, which are elusive and mobile.” Pests and diseases In the last few years, a number of new pests and diseases have emerged as significant risks to trees and plants in the UK including: Chalara fraxinea (Ash dieback) Phytophthora spp. Oak Processionary Moth Asian longhorn beetle Pests and diseases like these may not be significant in their native countries because: host plants may be more resistant, having grown up alongside them over thousands of years natural predators may be present environmental conditions can be different However, plants and trees in the UK may have little or no natural resistance, natural controls may not be present and the surrounding environment is different. Head of Plant Health Public Engagement at the APHA, Paul Beales, said: “The issue of the increase in the arrival, establishment and spread of plant pests is a global one, largely due to international trade and travel, and needs to be tackled as such. “The garden represents the need to work together and share information and knowledge on an international scale.” Government action Safeguarding plants and trees from pests and diseases is one of Defra’s four top priorities. Decisive action is being taken to help protect against the introduction and spread of plant pests and diseases. APHA is working with Botanic Gardens Conservation International (BGCI), as part of the International Plant Sentinel Network project. The network monitors tree sentinels in international botanic gardens and arboreta for damage by pests and diseases native to that country. It will help to: identify potential threats to native UK plants and trees before they are introduced improve the chances of eradication or control programmes stop their introduction in the first place How you can help Sentinel A sentinel is: a soldier or guard whose job is to stand and keep watch an indicator of the presence of disease Everyone can help conserve the UK environment be keeping an eye out for any serious pests and diseases that could threaten our plants and trees. You can do this by taking part in the OPAL (Open Air Laboratories network) Tree Health Survey . To help prevent the spread of plant pests and disease within and Beyond Our Borders you should: buy UK-produced seeds and plants where possible avoid bringing seeds, plants or cuttings home from trips abroad preferably plant small and enjoy watching your garden grow become familiar with new pest and disease threats, their hosts and symptoms Defra Chief Plant Health Officer, Nicola Spence, said: “It’s great that this year’s garden highlights the important work going on to identify, prevent and tackle pests and diseases that can harm our native plants and trees. “There are simple steps everyone can help with, such as keeping a look out for signs and reporting sightings of tree pests and diseases, and not bringing back plants from abroad, which will help to protect our countryside and wildlife.” Sponsors of the garden include Defra, the Shanghai Botanical Garden, Horticultural Trades Association and the Scottish Government."
/government/news/gold-at-rhs-chelsea-flower-show-for-the-apha-garden,"APHA garden awarded gold at this year’s RHS Chelsea Flower Show.  APHA garden at Chelsea Flower Show wins gold  Animal and Plant Health Agency Commissioned by the Animal and Plant Health Agency ( APHA ), the Beyond Our Borders garden highlights one way that global plant pest and disease threats are being monitored by the UK government. The garden was designed by multiple Chelsea gold winner Sarah Eberle. It brings to life the network of ‘plant sentinels’ (including UK native plants) which live outside their natural ranges in botanic gardens around the world. These plants are being monitored for pests and diseases that could potentially attack our native species. The garden is an eye-catching and innovative display featuring three climatic zones (Australasia, Arid and Tropical) divided by water features representing oceans. Each zone contains a British tree ‘sentinel’ standing among plants native to each area. Coiled springs and pulsing lights represent pests and diseases and their movement both within countries and across borders due to the increased trade in plants and plant material, global travel and natural spread. Garden designer Sarah Eberle commented: “It’s fantastic to have achieved a gold medal with this fresh garden. The Chelsea Flower Show offers an innovative and creative way to inform the public about how, by working together, we can protect our environment. “The coiled springs and pulsing lights in the garden have provided a novel talking point. I used these to illustrate the how plant pests and diseases, which are elusive and mobile, can be transferred across international borders” Sponsors of the Beyond Our Borders garden include: Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) Botanic Gardens Conservation International Scottish Government Horticultural Trades Association For more information on the garden visit: www.plantsentinel.org/apha_rhschelsea/ See also the following news stories: APHA garden at Chelsea Flower Show highlights global pest threats British horticulture praised by Environment Secretary"

Keep a copy of your permit to show APHA if they ask for it. Check if you need a declaration Some countries demand that the APHA adds a declaration to your phytosanitary certificate that confirms your shipment is free from pests and diseases which trade inspectors don’t check for. They demand this declaration in addition to the declaration that’s part of every phytosanitary certificate. Contact APHA to find out which countries demand this additional declaration. Hungary If you’re exporting grain to Hungary, you must get a declaration from APHA that states your consignment is free from acarus siro L. Vietnam If you’re exporting to Vietnam, you must get a declaration from APHA that states your consignment is free from tilletia indica (karnal bunt). Arrange an inspection When you’ve sent your application form to APHA and, if necessary, sent samples for testing, contact the port you’re exporting from to ask for a trade inspector to inspect your grain. The trade inspector you use must be authorised to inspect grain as part of phytosanitary certification - they must have completed APHA ’s training course. How inspection works Trade inspectors will sample and examine your grain when it arrives at the docks - they’ll do this when you’re loading, either from: your lorry to a store, silo or the ship from a silo or store to the ship Talk to the trade inspector before your consignment arrives to find out where they’ll sample and examine your grain. The inspector will check that your consignment: is free from quarantine pests, and practically free from other injurious pests meets plant health certification standards in the country you’re sending it to They’ll make a report and send it to APHA . After inspection and sending samples After you’ve had your consignment inspected by a trade inspector, or if necessary, got samples tested at an official laboratory, you must complete a second copy of form HH93 - this time complete section IV and part B. APHA will only give you a phytosanitary certificate if your authorised trade inspector’s report (and laboratory report, where necessary) states that your grain is free from pests and diseases. APHA can refuse your application for a plant health certificate if they believe: your export poses a risk to plant health you or your trade inspector have given them false or inaccurate information you haven’t met the conditions for treating or moving material intended for export, eg your grain is infested with insect pests and you haven’t had it fumigated by a qualified contractor If inspectors find pests or diseases If inspectors find pests or diseases in your consignment, you must have your grain treated by a professional company. The company you hire must remove pests and diseases from your grain by: fumigation - this can only be done in a ship’s hold, unless you contact APHA and agree otherwise residual treatment with aluminium phosphide or magnesium phosphide It’ll take between 10 and 20 days for your grain to be disinfested, depending on temperature. It can be done in a silo on the the dock or as the grain is being moved onto the boat. The boat can sometimes set sail while the fumigant is taking effect. After they’ve disinfested your grain, you need to complete form HH94 and send it to APHA . Country-specific tests Cuba If you’re exporting grain to Cuba, your consignment must be free from the following diseases - and you should tell the trade inspector to test for them: Trogoderma granarium everts Trogoderma ssp Tenebrio molitor L Tenebrio obscurus F Tribolium madens charp Triborium destructor uuytten Tribolium audax Halst Ptinus fur L Pitinus velliger F Niptus hololecus falderm Porthetria dispar L Ephestia kuehniella Zell Pyralis farinalis L Vietnam If you’re exporting grain to Cuba, your consignment must be free from Caulophilus latinasus or C.oryzae gyllen. Fees For phytosanitary certificates You must pay £59.53 to get phytosanitary certificates for consignments of grain. Services for consignments of grain You must pay £59.53 for a trade inspector to inspect your grain.

You can issue plant passports yourself, but you must be authorised by the Animal and Plant Health Agency ( APHA ). Find out: how to export plants to non-EU countries how to import plants from non-EU countries how to export grain to non-EU countries When you need a plant passport Check the following lists to find out if a consignment you’re trading in the EU (including within the UK) needs plant passports: [InlineAttachment:1] [InlineAttachment:2] [InlineAttachment:3] [InlineAttachment:4] If you’re not sure whether your consignment needs plant passports, contact APHA . Trading with Switzerland Check the following lists to find out if a consignment you’re trading with Switzerland needs plant passports: [InlineAttachment:5] [InlineAttachment:6] [InlineAttachment:7] [InlineAttachment:8] If you’re not sure whether your consignment needs plant passports, contact APHA . When you need a supplier document Check the following lists to find out if your consignment needs to travel with a supplier document: [InlineAttachment:9] [InlineAttachment:10] Your consignment must also travel with a supplier document if you’re moving ornamental plant propagating material, including seeds. Apply to be authorised To apply for authorisation to issue plant passports and supplier documents, complete an application form and send it to APHA . APHA will inspect your premises and your plants to decide whether to authorise you - they’ll give you a decision in a few days. Inspection fees You’ll have to pay £46.10 for every quarter of an hour or part of that time that an inspection takes, including the time it takes inspectors to travel to your site. The minimum fee for any inspection is £92.19. You won’t have to pay if APHA authorises you to issue supplier documents only. After you’re authorised If you’re authorised to issue plant passports, you’ll get a unique registration number - you can then issue as many passports and supplier documents as you need. You’ll only need a separate authorisation to issue supplier documents if you’re not already authorised to issue plant passports, eg if you’re trading fruits and vegetables that aren’t covered by the plant passport regime. Making a plant passport You must include the following details on plant passports: the phrase ‘EU Plant Passport’ ‘UK’ to show that the plants were grown in the UK or imported into the UK ‘EW’ (this is the code for APHA ) your unique APHA registration number and an individual serial, week, batch or invoice number the botanical name of the plant or plants the quantity in the consignment the letters ‘ZP’ and a protected zone code if you’re moving consignments in [InlineAttachment:11] the letters ‘RP’ if it’s a replacement plant passport the country of origin of the consignment, if it’s originally come from a non-EU country If you’re transporting a mix of items that need a plant passport and items that need a supplier document, you can use a plant passport to cover all of them, once you include the following information: the phrase ‘EU quality’ the variety name for rootstocks or a designation if there’s no variety name If your plant passport is for fruit, you must confirm that the fruit either meets conformitas agraria communitatis ( CAC ) standards - for the purposes of this guidance, this means stating the fruit is free of pests and diseases has a Plant Health Propagation Scheme ( PHPS ) grade - state the grade on the passport Plant passports and protected zones Some plants and plant products must have a passport to enter parts of EU countries called ‘protected zones’. If you’re making a plant passport to move restricted plants into a protected zone, you must include the code ‘ZP’ on the passport followed by the code for that protected zone. Check a list of [InlineAttachment:4] to find the code you need to include. Contact APHA if you need more information on protected zones. Replacement plant passports You must issue a replacement passport if you split a consignment of passported plants and you’re sending them to someone else. The replacement passport must include the following, along with the standard plant passport details: the letters ‘RP’ - for replacement passport the registration number of the original supplier your registration number and your serial, week, batch or invoice number For example, if your batch number is WK1, your registration number is 34567 and the original producer’s is 12345, you must label the plant passport UK/EW 34567 WK1/RP 12345. If you don’t want your customer to be able to identify your supplier, you can use your own code instead of their registration number - keep a log of your codes that allows APHA to identify suppliers. You can’t add protected zone codes to a replacement plant passport if they weren’t on the original, or omit them from a replacement passport if they were on the original. Choosing a plant passport format You can issue a plant passport for an individual plant or for a consignment - the passport can be a label, a sticker, a paper form or another document. You can either: include all the information on a delivery note or on another document travelling with the consignment include all the information on labels attached to the plants or plant products and their packaging - if you do this you must use at least one label for each plant of the same variety, grown in the same place by the same producer, and destined for the same customer If you’re moving passported plants with plants that don’t have passports, you can use one delivery note or document to give details of all the plants. Making a supplier document For fruit and vegetable plants Your supplier document for fruit and vegetable plants must include: the phrase ‘EU Quality’ ‘UK’ (to show that the plants were grown in, or imported into, the UK) ‘EW’ (the code for APHA ) your unique APHA registration number your company name your individual serial, week, batch or invoice number the date on which you made the document the botanical name of the plants or common name for vegetables the variety name for rootstocks or a designation if there’s no variety name the quantity in the consignment For ornamental plants Your supplier document for ornamental plants must include: the phrase ‘EU Quality’ ‘UK’ (to show that the plants were grown in, or imported into, the UK) ‘EW’ (the code for APHA ) your unique APHA registration number your company name your individual serial, week, batch or invoice number the date on which you made the document the botanical name of the plants the variety name for rootstocks or a designation if there’s no variety name the denomination of the group of plants the quantity in the consignment the country of production of the consignment, if the plants and plant products have been imported from a non-EU country Trading potatoes Seed potatoes Seed potatoes must be accompanied by plant passports at every stage of the trade chain in the EU, whether you’re sending them to another UK site or to another EU member state. If you grow seed potatoes you must be authorised by the APHA to make plant passports. Find out how to get authorised as part of the Seed Potato Classification Scheme ( SPCS ) . Potato cyst nematode ( PCN ) If you’re producing plants for planting or bulbs that are grown in soil or growing material that contains soil, using the following species, you may need to get them tested for potato cyst nematode before you can trade them: leeks strawberry sugar beet young brassica plants for planting young asparagus plants for planting pepper tomato aubergines bulbs, tubers and rhizomes You must contact APHA to arrange a PCN test unless: you’re planting the plants at the same place where they were raised you’ll put the plants through a PCN disinfestations process before you move them you’ll have the plants brushed or washed until free of soil the field where you’ll grow the plants has been free of PCN for 12 years, and you have test results to prove this you can confirm no potatoes, peppers, aubergines or tomatoes were grown in the field where you’ll grow the plants, in the last 12 years Renewing authorisation You must contact APHA to renew your authorisation each year. Inspections After you apply for renewal, APHA will inspect your site. They’ll do this between 2 and 4 times per year, depending on your business’s risk to plant health. Inspectors will: interview you or the person responsible for plant passports at your site audit your records inspect host plants and sample them to make sure they’re free from pests or diseases that could make trading in the EU a plant health risk give you or the person responsible an update on the latest plant quarantine pest and disease risks They’ll then discuss test results and any issues they find at your site. If they’re satisfied your site doesn’t pose a risk to plant health, they’ll renew your authorisation. Fees The fee for renewal inspections is the same as for first inspections - £46.10 for every quarter of an hour or part of that time that an inspection takes, including the time it takes inspectors to travel to your site. The minimum fee for any inspection is £92.19. Keeping records You must keep the following for 1 year: all plant passports that you issue or receive a record of any plant propagating material you buy or sell a record of any mixing you did during packaging, storage, transport or delivery Your records must allow APHA to investigate any pest or disease outbreaks. If a supplier sends you a plant passport in the form of a label, you must keep the label. If this is impossible, eg because the label is glued to a tray, write the details into a manual or save them in a file on your computer. You don’t have to keep supplier documents, unless part of them forms the plant passport. Paying APHA to issue plant passports If you’re not authorised or you don’t want to get authorised, you can contact APHA and pay them to issue plant passports for you. To do this, you must get your site inspected by APHA - you need to give the inspectors 7 days notice. You’ll have to pay £46.10 for every quarter of an hour or part of that time that an inspection takes, including the time it takes inspectors to travel to your site. The minimum fee for any APHA inspection is £92.19.

/guidance/handling-and-disposing-of-international-catering-waste,"How to check if your waste is international catering waste (ICW) and how to store, transport and dispose of it.   Handling and disposing of international catering waste Waste Animal and Plant Health Agency Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs International catering waste ( ICW ) is food waste from international transport vehicles including: cruise ships airlines private or commercial yachts and boats armed forces ships and submarines ferries Food and drink is not considered ICW until it is no longer fit for human consumption or has been mixed with food waste. ICW is a high-risk category 1 animal by-product ( ABP ), unless it’s from planes, vehicles, or ships travelling in EU territory only. Find out about the 3 different categories of ABP . There are controls on how you handle and dispose of ICW to prevent outbreaks of notifiable diseases like foot and mouth disease . When your waste is considered ICW Your waste is considered ICW if your vessel or aircraft travels outside the EU, even if you stocked up for the entire journey in the EU. Countries which are not part of the EU, but are part of Europe geographically, like Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, are normally treated as member states. How to store ICW You must have your ICW stored in a dedicated container that is: covered leak-proof clearly labelled ‘Category 1 - for disposal only’ You can use a compactor to reduce the waste volume, as long as you: keep it in a covered area control any liquid run-off clean and disinfect areas contaminated with liquid run-off Many ports and airports will have these containers on site. How to transport ICW You must send ICW for disposal as quickly as possible after the vessel or aircraft has docked or landed. You must clean and disinfect any containers that held ICW after each use, with a Defra-approved disinfectant. Find out how to transport ABPs , and how to label any ABPs you move . How to dispose of ICW You can only dispose of ICW by processing used cooking oil into biodiesel in an approved plant combusting it for use as fuel, at an approved plant, with or without prior processing incinerating or co-incinerating it without prior processing and following processing (methods 1-5) and permanent marking by use of glyceryl tri-heptanoate (GTH) disposal by pressure sterilisation and deep burial in an authorised landfill disposal by deep burial in an authorised landfill (no pre-treatment is required) You must not use ICW in biogas or composting plants . You must keep records and copies of commercial documents for the Animal and Plant Health Agency ( APHA ) to inspect. Find out more about incinerating ABPs . Who is responsible for disposal? The responsibility for identifying and disposing of ICW lies with either: the private owner of the vessel or aircraft the company that owns the vessel or aircraft the armed force that operates the vessel or aircraft If you hire a company to move ICW off your boat or aircraft, you’re still responsible for making sure it’s identified and disposed of legally. Waste disposal: shipmasters’ responsibilities Before your merchant boat, ship or fishing vessel leaves a harbour or terminal, you must send waste to a waste reception facility, unless your vessel has enough waste storage capacity for the next leg of the journey. You must tell the harbour authority if you’re not unloading waste due to having enough storage capacity. Recycling ICW and other materials You must separate items for recycling before they are placed in a waste bin or plastic bag. You cannot recycle items that have been mixed with pots of honey, milk or milk products, unless you can guarantee that the product has been treated in a treatment plant in the EU, eg, a milk processing plant. Plastic cups used for hot drinks that contain milk from treatment plants outside the EU must be disposed of as ICW . You can recycle other items as long as they have not been mixed with catering waste. This includes: confectionery crisps and nuts drinks not containing milk Declaring waste as domestic catering waste Any food waste you produce after your vessel or aircraft has re-entered the EU will be considered domestic waste if: you clean and disinfect all areas on your vessel that come into contact with food (galley, store rooms) any restocking is done after you returned to EU territory Vessels must complete a written declaration to show that all these actions have been taken. Commercial planes don’t need a declaration. On a ship, this must be completed by the ship’s master, and handed to the port, harbour, marina, boatyard or naval yard operator for audit by APHA . For military air bases the declaration should be kept by the base for audit by APHA . Private plane operators should leave the declaration with the airport operator for APHA to collect, or send it to the APHA office responsible for that airport. Catering waste from submarines and fishing vessels that do not land in countries outside of the EU or re-stocked with food outside of EU waters is not considered International catering waste."

/guidance/bse,"How to spot BSE, what to do if you suspect it, measures you must take to prevent it and when you must have cattle tested.     BSE: how to spot and report the disease  Animal and Plant Health Agency Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Bovine spongiform encephalopathy ( BSE ), known as mad cow disease, is a fatal brain disease that affects cattle. BSE is a notifiable disease. That means if you suspect it you must tell the Animal and Plant Health Agency ( APHA ) immediately. Failure to do so is an offence. This applies to pet and small holder animals as well as commercial cattle. How to spot BSE Affected cattle do not usually show signs of BSE until they’re at least 4 or 5 years old. Cattle with BSE may slowly develop some of the following signs over a period of weeks or months: change in behaviour apprehension or nervousness (flighty) repeated, exaggerated reactions to touch or sound weakness or high stepping of the legs, particularly the hind legs reluctance to cross concrete or drains, turn corners or enter yards or go through doorways aggression towards humans or towards other cattle manic kicking during milking or reluctance to allow milking head held low difficulty in rising, progressing to recumbency tremors under the skin loss of body condition, weight or milk yield excessive nose licking Feeding animals There is a ban on feeding any animal protein to ruminants (cattle, sheep, goats) and on feeding processed animal protein to all farmed animals, although there are exceptions. See the guidance on TSE regulations and feed controls . See guidance on how to feed milk or milk products to animals on your farm, and guidance on how to use leftover milk or milk products as farm animal feed . Disposing of Specific Risk Material Specific Risk Materials (SRM) are body parts of cattle or sheep that may contain significant amounts of prion in infected animals. Prion is the protein that can causes BSE when eaten by cattle. Different animal parts are considered SRM, depending on whether they’re from a sheep or a cow and the age of the animal. All body parts of cattle born in the UK before 1 August 1996 are SRM and are banned from entering the food chain. See the guidance on disposing of ABPs and animal by-product categories . Movement restrictions You must apply for a movement licence to move any cattle born or reared in the UK before 1 August 1996. This is to prevent any meat or other body parts from these animals entering the food chain. Milk from these animals can be sold for human consumption. Testing cattle for BSE Cattle slaughtered for human consumption You must have cattle that were slaughtered for human consumption tested for BSE if they meet both of the following conditions: they were born in Romania, Bulgaria, Croatia or any non-EU country they were older than 30 months and disease-free at the time of slaughter Cattle sent for emergency slaughter or fallen stock You must have cattle tested for BSE if they meet any of the following conditions: they’ve been sent for emergency slaughter they were found to be sick in an inspection after death they’re fallen stock, ie their death was not due to being slaughtered for human consumption This rule applies to cattle that are either: older than 48 months, if born in EU member states except Romania, Bulgaria and Croatia older than 24 months if born in Romania, Bulgaria, Croatia, or any non-EU country You must send fallen cattle that require BSE testing to an approved BSE sampling site . What happens if you suspect BSE If one of your animals is showing signs of BSE you must report this to your local APHA office . An APHA vet will visit your farm and carry out a veterinary assessment on the animal as soon as possible. If the APHA vet suspects your animal has BSE , they’ll issue a notice restricting the movement of the animal (movement restriction). They’ll either cull the animal on your premises or transport it to an APHA laboratory for slaughter depending on the animal’s condition. They’ll put a herd restriction in place prohibiting the movement of cattle on and off your farm (whole herd restriction) and test your animal to find out if it has BSE . Once cohort and offspring animals are identified, they’ll issue notices restricting the movements of these animals and the whole herd restrictions are lifted. If BSE is suspected in a female cow, the APHA will trace any of its offspring that were born up to 2 years before or after the mother showed signs of the disease. They’ll put movement restrictions in place and they’ll slaughter the offspring if BSE is confirmed in the mother. Testing cohorts Cohorts are cattle which were either: born in the same herd as the BSE case, up to a year before or after its birth; or reared with a BSE case at any time before both were up to a year old APHA uses data from BCMS records to identify cohorts of cattle that have tested postive for BSE . Cohorts of infected cattle must be culled and tested for disease because of the likelihood that they have received the same feed as the BSE case. If your cattle are identified as cohorts and APHA intends to cull them, you can appeal if you have evidence that the animals were not exposed to the same feed as the animal confirmed to have BSE . You will need to provide feed control records for the period when the BSE case and the cohorts were reared together to show that the cohorts did not at any time receive the same feed as the BSE case. This includes the purchase of raw materials for feed from the same source and common feed sources such as salt blocks. You can also appeal to delay the cull of bulls continuously kept at a semen collection centre. In this case, the bull would not be culled until the end of its productive life. If you want to appeal, you must write to the local APHA office dealing with the case within 21 days of receiving the notification of the decision to cull the cattle. Compensation You’ll be paid compensation for any BSE suspect, offspring or cohort that has been culled to control BSE . See the guidance on compensation ."

/guidance/how-to-deal-with-non-bovine-tb-in-your-animals,"How to manage tuberculosis (TB) in your non-bovine animals - when you can move them and how to get compensation if you slaughter them.  How to deal with TB in non-bovine animals Bovine TB Animal and Plant Health Agency Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Overview Tuberculosis ( TB ) is an infectious respiratory disease found in mammals. This guide applies to TB infection in domestic non-bovine animals (e.g. deer, pigs, sheep, goats, camelids), including those kept as pets. There is separate guidance for TB in domestic pets How to spot TB Signs of TB in animals are: coughing or breathing problems loss of condition loss of appetite debilitating disease reduced milk yield (for dairy animals) seeing no improvement from a respiratory infection after antibiotic treatment You should get advice from your vet if you think any of your animals have TB . How TB spreads Animals to animals TB can spread to your domestic animals from: infected cattle infected wild animals, eg wild deer, badgers infected non-bovine animals introduced to your herd It can spread directly from animal to animal, or indirectly through contaminated: manure urine bedding feed water slurry equipment Animals to people TB can spread from infected animals to humans if people: breathe in animal breath touch animal waste (urine or faeces) have cut skin and touch animals or carcasses eat dairy products made from unpasteurised milk from infected dairy animals If you suspect TB You must immediately contact APHA if you or your vet suspect a live animal or carcase is infected with TB . After contacting APHA , you should keep the animal or carcase on your premises isolated as far as is practical from other livestock until APHA carry out an investigation. APHA will visit as soon as possible and examine the animals or carcases, and test and take samples as required. APHA usually put movement restrictions on premises until they determine that TB is not present. The vet’s tests You must allow an APHA vet to test your animals for TB . For non-bovine animals the vet uses the tuberculin skin test. The vet injects tuberculin into the animal’s skin and measures how the skin has reacted after about 3 days. In species where skin testing is difficult such as pigs and park deer, the results of abattoir post-mortem examinations may be taken into consideration when APHA decide on lifting restrictions. APHA has powers in England to require the TB testing of all non-bovine animals. If you don’t allow the APHA vet to test your animals, movement restrictions will not be lifted. After the tests are completed (this may involve repeat rounds of testing) the vet will confirm whether the animals have TB and whether the restrictions can be lifted. If TB is found APHA has statutory powers in England to slaughter and remove livestock of any species that test positive for TB . Movement restrictions You’ll need to restrict the movement of your animals until APHA is satisfied that TB is no longer on your farm. Vaccination and treatment Don’t use antimicrobial drugs, e.g. antibiotics or antiviral drugs. There are no vaccines approved in the UK for the vaccination of animals (except badgers) against TB . Milk You must not supply milk from infected animals for human consumption, and you should not consume it yourself. Compensation for slaughtered animals (in England) You will receive statutory compensation payments for all animals removed. For pigs, sheep and goats, there are no specific amounts of statutory compensation set out in legislation. Instead Defra is obliged to provide you with a valuation of the animals to be compulsorily slaughtered. For deer, you’ll get 50% of their market value up to a maximum of £600 per animal. For camelids, you’ll get £750 per animal. There are no specific statutory compensation amounts for goats, pigs and sheep. For these species compensation will be based on a valuation of the compulsorily slaughtered animals. Arbitration arrangements are in place for cases where that valuation is disputed. For all species, if you get approval from APHA you can choose to slaughter your animals at your own expense and keep any salvage value. Day-to-day disease control Ask your vet for advice to reduce the risk of introducing TB to your animals. See the disease prevention for livestock and poultry keepers guidance . Moving your animals You should keep a record of animals moving on and off your premises including animals that go to events, e.g. livestock shows or if they’re moved for mating. Precautionary tests You should consider seeking APHA approval to privately test animals for TB before you bring them on to your premises. APHA can ask to test your animals for TB if: during routine abattoir meat inspection of your animals suspect lesions have tested positive for TB the bacterium that causes TB (M. bovis) has been found in laboratory samples of your animals TB has been found in other groups of animals kept on your farm e.g. cattle or in animals kept on neighbouring premises animals have moved to your premises from a place where TB has been confirmed (tracings) You don’t pay for these tests - the government covers the costs."

Importing trees and plants to England and Wales from the EU  Animal and Plant Health Agency You must follow this guide if you’re bringing certain types of trees, including potted plants and seeds, into England and Wales from the EU and Switzerland. Some plants must have a plant passport for trading in the EU as part of the plant health controls . The notification requirements in this guide are in addition to the plant passport scheme. You must tell the Animal and Plant Health Agency ( APHA ) if you’re bringing the following trees, plants and seeds into England and Wales: Oak Pine Elm Sweet Chestnut Plane Ash (currently prohibited) Prunus (e.g cherry, peach, plum, laurel) Following a consultation with stakeholders, the genus prunus has been added to the EU Plant and Tree Notification Scheme. This comes into effect on 24 February 2016.

Your goods may be returned to the country where they came from or destroyed. You also risk infecting plants and trees with pests and diseases which are present in parts of the EU. EU Plant and Tree Notification System You can use the online edomero system to tell APHA the planned destination in England and Wales you’re importing plants and trees. You should do this before or within 5 days of the arrival of your consignment. You only need to notify APHA about the first import of each consignment of plant or tree material into England and Wales, and not material which has moved further through the supply chain. If you’re sourcing and receiving deliveries from the EU directly to a planting site, you should notify APHA and tell them the address of the site. Follow the instructions on [InlineAttachment:1]. Contact your local Plant Health & Seeds Inspectorate Office if you have any questions about using the system. Inspections If your consignment is inspected, this doesn’t mean that there is a pest or disease issue. Inspections are for routine pest and disease surveillance. You won’t be charged if your consignment is inspected. You may be asked for a second location if you’re moving your consignment from its original destination within a few days after they’re imported. Your PHO will arrange an inspection at the consignment’s final destination or planting site. The inspector will record the planting site because follow-up inspections may be needed the following year. Follow-up inspections check for disease that can be hidden or is difficult to identify on dormant tree and plant material. Imports from outside the EU Read the guidance on importing plants, fruit, vegetables or plant material to the UK if you’re importing trees, plants and seeds from outside the EU.

Importing plants, fruit, vegetables or plant material to the UK Crops and horticulture  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Animal and Plant Health Agency Categories of material Plants, fruit, vegetables and plant material (like soil) from outside the EU fall into 3 categories: ‘unrestricted’ material you can bring to the UK without any conditions ‘controlled’ material that you can only bring into the UK with a ‘phytosanitary certificate’ to show it meets the requirements for entry to the EU ‘prohibited’ material you can’t bring into the UK unless you get a scientific research licence or an exception (‘derogation’) to the rules - contact the Animal and Plant Health Agency ( APHA ) if you want to apply for a derogation The rest of this guide explains how to import controlled material that requires a phytosanitary certificate. Find out how to send or receive plants within the EU and how to export plants to non-EU countries . Material that’s controlled Controlled plants, fruit, vegetables and plant material include: all plants for planting common fruits (except for bananas and grapes) cut flowers some seeds and leafy vegetables potatoes from some countries If you’re not sure whether the item you want to bring to the UK is controlled, check the list of plant species by import category or contact APHA . Personal allowance You can import a total of 5 controlled plants without a phytosanitary certificate, if you’re returning from an EU country or Switzerland, Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Syria, Tunisia and Turkey and the plants are: in your personal baggage for your personal use not diseased or infected with pests Otherwise you must follow the procedures in this guide. Register as an importer You must follow the Procedure for Electronic Application for Certificates from the Horticultural marketing inspectorate ( PEACH ). Register for PEACH before you start importing plants. Once you’re registered you can follow the progress of your consignments through inspections and other checks on the PEACH website . Phytosanitary certificates You must get a phytosanitary certificate for each consignment of controlled plants, fruit, vegetables or plant material that you import, from the plant health authority in the country where your supplier is. The certificate is a statement from the plant health authority that the consignment: has been officially inspected complies with legal requirements for entry into the EU is free from serious pests and diseases The inspection referred to in the certificate must take place no more than 14 days before the consignment is dispatched from the inspecting country. The certificate must be signed by someone in the inspecting plant health authority within the same 14 day period. If your consignment includes plants from more than one country, you’ll need to get a separate phytosanitary certificate from the plant health authority in each country. Quantity Phytosanitary certificates include a ‘quantity declared’ section. Tell the plant health authority that’s completing the form to fill in quantities as follows. For cut flowers quantity must be stated as the number of stems. Quantities must be stated in kilograms (kg) for fruit, vegetables, soil and branches with foliage, potatoes, grain and the following plants for planting: bulbs corms and rhizomes plants in tissue culture seeds For any other plants for planting, the quantity must be recorded as the number of items in the consignment. It’s up to you to make sure quantities are stated in this way. The plant health authority may use quantity measures for consignments bound for other countries, so you will need to tell them about the measures required for UK-bound consignments. Pre-arrival notification You must use the PEACH website to give advance notice each time you bring a consignment to the UK. You must give: at least 4 hours notice on a working day (ie a weekday that isn’t a UK bank holiday for consignments coming by air freight at least 3 workings days notice for consignments coming by any other means, eg by ship You must also scan the following documents and upload them to the PEACH website before your consignment arrives: the phytosanitary certificate for the consignment the travel ticket if you’re travelling with the plants yourself bill of lading, cargo movement request or delivery company invoice if you’re not travelling with the plants the form you must complete to record details of your imported plant material - this applies to plant material for planting Inspections When it arrives in the UK, your consignment must be presented for inspection to check it: includes all required documents contains the plants you have said it does is free from pests and diseases If your consignment doesn’t pass an inspection it may be destroyed, treated, or sent back to where you sent it from at your expense. Inspection fees For each consignment you have to pay 3 separate fees. Document check fee You’ll have to pay a fee of £5.71 for each consignment, to cover the cost of checking the consignment’s paperwork. Identity check fee You must pay a further fee to cover the cost of inspectors checking your consignment. This checking fee will be £5.71 if your consignment is size of a truck or a railway wagon, or smaller, and £11.42 if it’s bigger than that. Physical inspection fee You’ll also have to pay a physical inspection fee, which depends on the type of plant material you’re importing. Check specific fees in schedule 1 of the Plant Health (Fees) (England) Regulations 2014 . Reduced inspection fees Certain plant material requires a reduced level of physical inspection, if it’s imported from particular countries. Inspection fees are lower in these cases. Check the Plant Health (Fees) (England) Regulations 2015 to find out if your consignment qualifies for lower inspection fees. Points of entry You can use these designated points of entry to bring your consignment into the UK. You’ll be able to select the point of entry you want to use from a drop down list on the PEACH website. Heathrow Consignments can be inspected at Heathrow from 6am until midnight everyday. APHA will inspect your consignment within 4 hours of it arriving as long as: you’ve given the required 4 working hours notice it arrives and is presented for inspection at the time you indicated on your PEACH application Arrivals outside working hours If your consignment is going to arrive at Heathrow outside working hours (8.30am to 5pm), APHA will still try to inspect your consignment within 4 hours if you pay a ‘non-daytime working hours fee’. The non-daytime working hours fee replaces the standard physical inspection fee. It’s different for different plant species. Non-daytime working hours fees for regular consignments are listed in Schedule 1 of the Plant Health (Fees) (England) Regulations 2014 . Non-daytime working hours fees for consignments that qualify for reduced inspections are listed in Schedule 2 of the Plant Health (Fees) (England) Regulations 2014 . You must indicate that you’re willing to pay the non-daytime working hours fee on your PEACH form if you want to use this service.

/guidance/enzootic-bovine-leukosis,"How to spot enzootic bovine leukosis, what to do if you suspect it and measures to prevent its spread. Enzootic bovine leukosis: how to spot and report the disease  Animal and Plant Health Agency Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Enzootic bovine leukosis affects cattle. It doesn’t affect humans. It was last present in Great Britain in 1996. Enzootic bovine leukosis disease is a notifiable disease. That means if you suspect it you must tell the Animal and Plant Health Agency ( APHA ) immediately. Failure to do so is an offence. How to spot enzootic bovine leukosis Most infected cattle will show no sign of the disease, but clinical signs can include: tumours in many parts of the body, which can appear as bumps in the skin problems digesting food and loss of appetite and weight weakness, fever and abnormal breathing fall in milk production bulging eyes diarrhoea or constipation partial paralysis of the hind legs Internal tumours may only become apparent once cattle have been killed and butchered, so abattoir workers should look out for them. If tumours are spotted on a carcass, the abattoir must keep the carcass on site and report it to the APHA so it can be examined. How enzootic bovine leukosis is spread The disease can be spread: from cows to baby calves during pregnancy or when suckling between animals in close contact through infected blood on surgical equipment and gloves Preventing and controlling enzootic bovine leukosis You can help prevent the disease by practising strict biosecurity on your premises If you report suspicion of enzootic bovine leukosis APHA vets will investigate. If the disease is confirmed the outbreak will be controlled in line with the contingency plan for exotic notifiable diseases . Further information on prevention and control Controls to prevent disease What happens when a notifiable disease is suspected or confirmed Legislation relating to enzootic bovine leukosis The Enzootic Bovine Leukosis (England) Order 2000 is the main law on the disease.

/government/collections/tse-disease-surveillance-statistics,"Statistics and reports on the disease surveillance of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) in Great Britain. TSE disease surveillance statistics  Animal and Plant Health Agency Surveillance for TSEs is carried out in the United Kingdom in animal susceptible to the disease. This includes cattle, sheep and goats. EU Member States carry out TSE surveillance in line with EU law. The main aim is to monitor trends in disease incidence and prevalence to evaluate the effectiveness of TSE disease controls. Surveillance is not in itself protection against disease, but supports other control measures that either exclude affected animals or remove potentially high risk tissues from the food chain. The surveillance data also determines the TSE status of each country. There are two categories of surveillance: Passive surveillance This is when an animal with clinical signs suspicious of BSE or scrapie is reported to an APHA Office to be investigated. Such cases are slaughtered and the examination of the brain determines whether the animal was affected by BSE or scrapie. APHA has been recording and analysing data from reported cases in cattle since the start of the BSE epidemic in 1986, and for scrapie in sheep and goats since this disease became notifiable in 1993. Active surveillance The EU requires all Member States to carry out active surveillance for TSEs : cattle have been tested since July 2001 sheep and goats have been tested since January 2002 a survey in farmed and wild deer started in 2007 APHA also provides summary statistics on the number of submissions tested and cases confirmed through the Compulsory Scrapie Flocks Scheme. Active surveillance  Species  AHVLA provides summary statistics on the number of cases found through active and passive surveillance in Great Britain by species. Scrapie reports "

You won’t be able to get seeds certified or market seeds if your business doesn’t have a licence. See a list of licensed seed companies in England and Wales . Inspections after you’re licensed After you’ve got a licence to market seeds, APHA officials will visit your site at least once a year to check your records, inspect your premises and crops, and sample your seeds. APHA will usually contact you to arrange an inspection. If you’re licensed solely to market seed, APHA will contact you every 3 years to check your business details. Check if your varieties of seed are listed A variety is a sub-category of any species of seed. You can’t get seeds certified unless they’re a variety which is on the UK national list or the EU common catalogue . You can apply to have a new variety added to the national list . Certification categories You may be able to apply to enter your seed in the following categories, depending on the stage your seed is at in the multiplication process: pre-basic (PB) basic (B) certified seed (CS) certified seed of the first generation (C1) certified seed of the second generation (C2) certified seed of the third generation (C3) (only flax or linseed can be certified in this category) commercial seed (only annual meadowgrass, Hungarian vetch, sainfoin and black mustard can be certified in this category) standard seed (you can only market vegetable seeds in this category) Standard vegetable seeds must meet analytical and varietal purity and germination standards before you can market them. Enter your crops You must tell NIAB that you’re growing crops to produce seeds, this is known as ‘entering your crops’. Online If you’re already registered on the Government Gateway, you can enter your crops online . Register on the Government Gateway See the [InlineAttachment:3] on how to use the online system.

To do this, combine the following details: the last 2 digits of the harvest year (eg 14 if the year was 2014) your licence number the sheet number of the form (eg if you’re sending 3 forms, the first sheet number would be 1, the second would be 2, etc) For example, if the harvest year was 2014, your licence number was 123 and the sheet number was 05, you should use the crop identity number 14/123/05. Deadlines for crop entry Cereal seeds You must enter crops of cereal seeds by the following dates: winter sown cereals - 31 January spring sown cereals - 15 April Fodder plant seeds You must enter fodder plant seeds by the following dates: winter sown field peas and field beans - 31 January spring sown field peas and field beans - 15 April Grasses and herbage legumes You must enter grasses and herbage legumes by the following dates: lots for sowing in spring of that year, including clover and minor grass species sown for harvesting the next year - 31 January lots of ryegrass species for sowing in autumn of the same year - 31 January spring lupins and spring sown vetches - 15 April seeds of all traditionally managed clover crops and local varieties - 30 May seeds of all traditionally managed grass crops and local varieties - 30 May biennial seed crops (swede and fodder kale) - 15 October annual seed crops (fodder radish) - 15 April Oil and fibre plant seeds You must enter oil and fibre plant crops by the following dates: annual seed crops sown in spring, ie white mustard, brown mustard, flax, linseed, oilseed rape, sunflower and turnip rape - 15 April biennial seed crops sown in autumn, ie oilseed rape, fodder rape and turnip rape - 15 October winter hardy linseed - 31 January soya bean - 15 May Beet seeds You must enter beet seeds, ie sugar beet, fodder beet and mangels by the following dates: biennial seed crops - 15 October transplanted seed crops - 15 April Vegetable seeds You must enter vegetable seeds by the following dates: autumn sown biennial seed crops - 15 October spring sown biennial seed crops - 15 April spring sown annual seed crops - 15 April Crop inspection You must have your crops inspected - you’ll have to use an official inspector or a licensed inspector depending on what you’re applying to produce. See the instructions on crop inspections . When you need an official inspection NIAB will arrange an official inspection of crops entered to produce the following: pre-basic seed basic seed The inspector will complete a crop inspection report. Fees for official inspections You’ll have to pay the following fees for official inspections: cereal, pulses, linseed and heritage - £62 per hectare if you apply by post, £60 per hectare if you apply online beet , oilseed rape, mustard, fodder rape, beet and kale - £97 per hectare if you apply by post, £95 per hectare if you apply online hybrid rape - £132 per hectare if you apply by post, £130 if you apply online When you need a licensed inspection You must contact a licensed crop inspector to arrange the inspection of any crops you enter to produce CS, C1, C2, or C3 flax seed that’s a listed variety. Contact APHA to get a list of licensed crop inspectors and their contact details. You must give the inspector a copy of the CERT 3 crop inspection report to complete - find the form you need . The crop inspector will inspect the crop and send you the completed CERT 3 to tell you if your crop meets certification standards. Fees for licensed inspections For licensed crop inspections of crops at grade CS, C1, C2, and C3, except for early multiplication and late entered crops, you must pay either: £5.50 per hectare if you apply by post £4.50 per hectare if you apply online Arranging a second official inspection If you don’t agree with the results of an official inspection, you can contact NIAB and ask them to arrange a second inspection. You’ll have to pay £35 per hectare and NIAB will invoice you. Arranging a second licensed inspection If you don’t agree with the results of a licensed inspection, you can contact the licensed inspector and ask them to arrange a second inspection. Control plot reports When you enter your crops, NIAB will take a sample of the seed from the seed lot you grew them in and grow it in an official control plot. They do this so that they can check the grown material meets the standards of the variety you want it certified in. If your crop fails to meet standards, they’ll send you a control plot report - they can do this at any time during the growing season. Crop inspectors will compare the results of their inspection to control plot reports before making a final decision. For officially inspected crops If the NIAB sends you a control plot report before inspection, the official inspector will use it as a guide. If your crop fails a control plot report after passing inspection, contact NIAB to discuss the results. They may decide to do a second inspection to do this if the report found that your crop is contaminated, the wrong variety, or the first inspector couldn’t check the impurities at the time. They can overturn the results of any previous inspection based on their discussion with you or the second inspection. For crops inspected by licensed inspectors If your crop was inspected by a licensed inspector and fails a control plot report, inspectors may visit your site and inspect it again, and discuss the results with NIAB. If NIAB confirms the control plot result, NIAB may declare post-control of the seed lot is unsatisfactory. This result would then apply to all crops sown with seed from that lot, regardless of whether they’ve been officially inspected. After crop inspection Your licensed or official crop inspector will sign the crop inspection report and state whether the crop meets: the standards for which you entered it the level for which you entered it, if it’s barley, oats, wheat or some fodder where a higher voluntary standard applies the standards or level of any lower generations for which it’s eligible the minimum standards for you to be allowed to produce seeds from it You can produce seeds from a crop provided it: passes at the category or level you entered it for and all lower categories levels for which it’s eligible passes at a lower category or level and is eligible for seed production at that category or level Sending crop inspection reports Sending official crop inspection reports If your crops were inspected by officials, the inspector will send the inspection report to NIAB. Sending licensed crop inspection reports If your crops were inspected by licensed inspectors, you need to send the completed crop inspection card to NIAB . Deadlines for sending crop inspection reports You must lodge crop inspection reports by 15 August, apart from for the following which you must lodge by 15 July: lots of ryegrass that you’re sowing in autumn of the same year biennial seed crops sown in autumn, ie oilseed rape, fodder rape and turnip rape Enter your seed lot To enter your seed lot, you must complete form CERT 5 and send it to a licensed seed sampler for testing. You’ll be sent back a test report form CERT 10 that gives you your results. Check if your seed meets the standards, if they do then you can get it certified for marketing. Fees You’ll have to pay the following fee to enter your seed lots: final generation (including retests) - 2H, 2L, CH, CL, C2 and C3 - £42 per seed lot if you apply by post, £34 if you apply online multiplication seed lots PB, B, 1H, 1L, C1, C2 (including retests) - £165 per seed lot if you apply by post, £155 if you apply online You can apply online , or to apply by post complete form CERT 7 and send it to NIAB. Create a seed lot reference number (SLRN) You must make a seed lot reference number (SLRN) for your seed lot - NIAB use this to identify your seed before and after marketing. You must use this number on all your applications and in any dealings that relate to that seed lot. For all seed lots except blends and mixtures Combine the following numbers: Combine the following numbers: the last two numbers of the harvest year (eg 14 if the year was 2014) the category code (eg 2H) - find a list of category codes in the [InlineAttachment:1] your licence number (you can use the breeder or maintainer’s license number if you’re entering seeds to be certified as pre-basic or basic) the sequential number of the lot produced by the person whose licence number you’ve used - this must be a unique number and you can make it up For example, if the harvest year was 2014, the category code was 2H, your licence number was 123 and the lot number you chose was 02, your seed lot reference number would be 14/2H/123/02. For cereal blends If the blend contains seeds from different harvest years, use the last 2 numbers of the most recent year - otherwise make the SLRN as you would for all other seed lots. For herbage, fodder, oil beet and vegetable blends Use the year when you blended the seed, not the year when you harvested it. For mixtures You can choose any reference number you want but it must contain the packer’s licence number at the end, eg packer number 9999 would add ‘/9999’ after the number you created. Taking a sample You must have your samples taken by a licensed of official seed sampler for seed which is being multiplied. Submitting samples of seed of multiplication categories in England If you’re submitting samples of seed from categories PB, B, CS, C1 or C2 the licensed seed testing station (LSTS) or official seed testing station (OSTS) will send the sample and seed test report to NIAB. Linseed and flaxseed The licensed seed testing station sends a 15g sample of the seed to the official seed testing station and to NIAB, with form CERT 5 attached. Breeder’s seed You must have breeder’s seed (also known as uncertified seed) sampled by a licensed seed sampler. Complete form CERT 5 and send it to NIAB, along with the sample. You don’t have to send a seed test report for breeder’s seed. The sample must be taken from a consignment of seed that has a seed lot reference number. It should have a supplier’s label that states: the name and address or registered number of the person labelling the seed the seed lot reference number the species and variety the words ‘breeder’s seed’ the declared net or gross weight or declared number of seeds Deadlines for seed lot entry Cereal seeds You must enter cereal seed lots by the following dates: winter sown cereals - 7 November spring sown cereals - 15 March Fodder plant seeds You must enter fodder plant seed lots by the following dates: winter sown field peas and field beans - 7 November spring sown field peas and field beans - 15 March Grasses and herbage legumes You must enter grasses and herbage legume seed lots by the following dates: lots for sowing in spring of that year, including clover and minor grass species sown for harvesting the next year - 15 March lots of ryegrass species for sowing in autumn of the same year - 15 September spring lupins and spring sown vetches - 15 March seeds of all traditionally managed clover crops and local varieties - 15 March seeds of all traditionally managed grass crops and local varieties - either 15 March or 15 September biennial seed crops (swede and fodder kale) - 31 August annual seed crops (fodder radish) - 15 March If you haven’t yet submitted a sample for lots of all grass species (except ryegrasses) and perennial herbage legumes - you must enter them by 15 August. Oil and fibre plant seeds You must enter oil and fibre plant seed lots by the following dates: annual seed crops sown in spring, ie white mustard, brown mustard, flax, linseed, oilseed rape, sunflower and turnip rape - 15 March biennial seed crops sown in autumn, ie oilseed rape, fodder rape and turnip rape - 31 August winter hardy linseed - 15 September soya bean - 21 April Beet seeds You must enter beet seed lots, ie sugar beet, fodder beet and mangels by the following dates: biennial seed crops - 31 August transplanted seed crops - 15 October Vegetable seeds You must enter vegetable seed lots for certification by the following dates: autumn sown biennial seed crops - 31 August spring sown biennial seed crops - 15 March spring sown annual seed crops - 15 March Late entries APHA can choose to accept late entries - they’ll decide whether to do this on a case by case basis, depending on: the crop species how late your entry is whether they can still grow a control plot Seed sampling and testing You must have your seed sampled and tested after it’s been processed, divided into seed lots, and sealed and labelled, to check it meets the standards for certification. You must have samples taken by a licensed seed sampler and tested by either a licensed seed testing station or an official seed testing station. Contact APHA if you can’t find a licensed seed sampler. See a list of official seed testing stations . See the instructions for seed samplers . Applying for sampling and testing of a qualifying seed lot Complete a CERT 5 application form for sampling and testing of a seed lot and give it to a licensed seed sampler. You can only apply for sampling and testing of your seed if it’s met crop standards and has a crop inspection report which is lodged with NIAB. You must complete a separate CERT 5 for each seed lot you entered. Testing The LSTS or OSTS will test your seed for analytical purity, other seed content and germination. For beet and cereal seed samples, they’ll also test moisture content. Your seed test report When tests are complete, the LSTS or OSTS send a seed test report to you and to NIAB. The report will state whether your seed meets the standards of the category or level of certification for which you’ve applied. If your seeds meet a lower category level than the one you applied for, your test report will tell you this. Sending seed test reports You must send your seed test reports to NIAB. Complete the form you need from the following list and send it to NIAB: CERT 7 (SUMM) for seed lots that aren’t blends CERT 7 for blended seed lots The LSTS sends copies of all final seed test reports to NIAB. Packing, sealing and labelling You must pack your seeds under supervision of a licensed seed sampler, whether they’re seeds that have to be certified for marketing or not. You can’t market your seeds unless you do this. For certified seed you must use official labels available from the APHA label contractor. For standard vegetable seed or small packets, you must use a supplier’s label which you can produce yourself. You must: use the correct label colour for the type and grade of seed make sure the printed information on the label is permanent and cannot be removed or fade Find out more about packing and labelling seeds in the [InlineAttachment:1] and annex G of the instructions for seed samplers .

/guidance/dus-protocols-for-testing-plant-varieties,"Protocols and procedures for testing the distinctiveness, uniformity and stability (DUS) of certain agricultural and vegetable plants. DUS protocols for testing plant varieties Crops and horticulture  Animal and Plant Health Agency EU Directive The EU Commission Directive 2015/1168/EU was administratively implemented in the United Kingdom on 5 May 2016. This specifies the minimum characteristics to be measured and the minimum conditions for examining certain varieties of agricultural and vegetable species for distinctiveness, uniformity and stability (DUS). See the [InlineAttachment:34]. DUS tests As part of the application process to add a plant variety to the National List or for approval of plant breeders’ rights, the plant variety must be tested to ensure it is distinct, sufficiently uniform and stable (DUS). DUS tests are carried out at approved centres over a 2-year period. They are done in line with protocols and procedures approved by the Plant Variety and Seeds Committee, which represents the national authorities on seeds issues. The Community Plant Variety Rights Office develops the technical protocols which set the characteristics to be used in the DUS tests. DUS criteria Distinct A distinct plant variety has one or more important characteristics that are different from other varieties included in the National List, a list of another EU state, or the EU Common Catalogue. Uniform A uniform plant variety has individual plants which have similar or genetically identical important characteristics, with very few aberrations. Stable A stable plant variety has important characteristics which remain true to their original description after successive propagations or multiplications.

/guidance/farm-saved-seed,"Farm Saved Seed rules, eligible species for payment and how to declare and make payments online. Farm Saved Seed Crops and horticulture  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Animal and Plant Health Agency Introduction If you are a grower or farmer, you may use seed that you have saved for your own use to grow and harvest a crop - this is known as Farm Saved Seed ( FSS ). Under section 9 of the Plant Varieties Act 1997, farmers must declare all their use of FSS and pay for their use of eligible varieties. These payments support continued investment in improved varieties, bred for UK conditions. This guide explains which FSS species are eligible for payment, and how growers and farmers can ensure they have complied with the FSS rules. It also explains how to declare and make payments for FSS online. Plant breeders’ rights Plant breeding has vastly improved the yield, quality and performance of agricultural crops in the UK. It remains a vital industry to keep Great Britain internationally competitive. Plant breeders’ rights give the breeder legal rights over the plant varieties they have developed and allow them to charge royalties for using these ‘protected’ varieties. If you are a breeder, this can provide funding for your work. In the UK, PBR are administered by the Plant Variety Rights Team in Cambridge which is part of the Animal and Plant Health Agency ( APHA ). FSS is seed planted on a farmer’s own land using seed harvested from their own holding. Your ‘own holding’ may have more than one farm, as long as all holdings are managed as the same business. By law, you cannot market, purchase, transfer or give seed from one business to another for subsequent re-planting. See the guide on plant breeders’ rights ( PBR ) . How to comply with the FSS rules You must declare all your use of FSS to the British Society of Plant Breeders ( BSPB ) and pay remuneration on eligible varieties. The legal requirement to declare applies whether the seed has been processed or taken straight from the barn. If you receive an FSS declaration request from the BSPB , you are legally obliged to make a declaration to provide them with the specified information set out in Regulation 3 of the Plant Breeders’ Rights (Farm Saved Seed) (Specified Information) Regulations 1998. You may do this using the BSPB declaration form or by other appropriate means. Cereals Under the Plant Varieties Act 1997, farmers must declare and pay for all eligible varieties of FSS they use to the BSPB . The BSPB collects royalties on FSS from growers for the following cereals: oats barley triticale wheat However, the BSPB and the UK farming unions have agreed that you do not need to pay for the genuine use of certain older varieties as FSS . These formerly zero-rated varieties now qualify for a 100 per cent instant refund: chariot (19/12/2015) soissons (1/5/2015) This refund is subject to verification of the variety’s identity. See the BSPB website for information on payment rates and eligible varieties for combinable crops. Certification, marketing, packaging and labelling of cereal seed If you produce and/or market cereal seed, your seed must be certified by APHA before it can be marketed. If you attempt to market seed that has not been certified, you could face legal action. To be certified, the seed must be a variety on the UK National List or in the European Community Common Catalogue. Your crop must also be inspected and a sample from your seed lot must be tested. NIAB deals with all the applications for seed certification. You must lodge a crop inspection report with NIAB within one month of receiving it. You must be registered with APHA before you can market seed covered by the cereal seed regulations. Packages of seed must be properly sealed and labelled, usually by a licensed seed sampler. See the guide on National Listing of agricultural and vegetable crops . Fodder plants Under the Plant Varieties Act 1997, farmers must declare and pay for all eligible varieties of FSS they use to the BSPB . The BSPB collects royalties on FSS from growers for these fodder plants: yellow lupin field pea field bean Fodder plant seeds marketing Your seed must be officially certified by the APHA seed team, if you produce and/or market these fodder seeds in England: fine grasses including annual meadowgrass, brown top, creeping bent grass, festulolium, red fescuse, red top, wood meadowgrass and similar fodder grasses including Alaska brome-grass, cocksfoot, hybrid ryegrass, meadow fescue, tall oatgrass, Timothy and similar small seeded legumes including Alsike clover, birdsfoot trefoil, lucerne, red clover, sainfoin and similar large seeded legumes including blue lupin, field bean, field pea, hairy vetch, yellow lupin and similar crucifers including fodder kale, fodder radish and swede Your seed will be certified if it meets these conditions: listing - the seed must be a variety or a hybrid on the UK National List or European Community Common Catalogue crop inspection - your crop must be inspected and must meet prescribed crop conditions seed testing - a sample from your seed lot must be tested and must meet prescribed seed conditions It is permitted to market certain combinations of fodder plant seeds and other species, but you need to be registered to market certified seed. All certified seed, including mixtures, must be packaged, sealed and officially labelled in line with the regulations. APHA maintains a record of all registered seed mixtures and preservation mixtures. You could face legal action if you do not comply with the regulations. Oil and fibre plants Under the Plant Varieties Act 1997, farmers must declare and pay for all eligible varieties of FSS they use to the BSPB . The BSPB collects royalties on FSS from growers for the following oil and fibre plants: swede rape linseed, excluding flax Certification, marketing and packaging of oil and fibre plant seed If you produce and/or market oil and fibre plant seeds, your seed must be certified by Fera before it can be marketed. To become certified, the seed must be a variety or hybrid on the UK National List or in the European Community Common Catalogue. See the guide on National Listing of agricultural and vegetable crops . Your crop must also be inspected and a sample from your seed lot tested. You could face legal action if you do not comply with the regulations. NIAB deals with all applications for seed certification. This includes arranging crop inspections to ensure the crop meets specified standards. You must lodge a crop inspection report with NIAB within one month of receiving it. If certification is withdrawn from a seed lot, you must notify anyone you have marketed the seed to within seven days of receiving the notice. If you are marketing imported seed, you must supply APHA with the following details within a month of marketing the seed: species variety category quantity country of production official inspection authority country of dispatch importer Packages of seed must be properly sealed and labelled, usually by a licensed seed sampler. Potatoes Under the Plant Varieties Act 1997, farmers must declare and pay for all eligible varieties of FSS they use to the BSPB . The BSPB collects royalties on FSS from growers of eligible potato varieties. FSS potato rates for each eligible potato variety are set by the variety owners. See the BSPB website for information on eligible varieties for potatoes. Under plant health regulations, potatoes can only be sown as FSS for one generation after certified seed. Growers who have purchased certified seed of potato varieties eligible for FSS payments will automatically receive an FSS declaration form to complete and return to BSPB the following year. Beet seeds If you produce and/or market beet seed, your seed must be certified by APHA before it can be marketed. To be certified, the seed must be a variety on the UK National List or in the European Community Common Catalogue. For more information, see the guide on agricultural and vegetable crops: the National Lists . Your crop must also be inspected and a sample from your seed lot must be tested. NIAB deals with all applications for seed certification. You must lodge a crop inspection report with NIAB within one month of receiving it. If certification is withdrawn from a seed lot, you must notify anyone you have marketed the seed to within seven days of receiving the notice. You must be registered with APHA before you can market seed covered by the beet seed regulations. Packages of seed must be properly sealed and labelled, usually by a licensed seed sampler. You may face legal action if you do not comply with the regulations. Declaring and paying for FSS There are several key FSS rules that farmers must follow. As a farmer, you: must declare all the FSS you use, whether it is eligible for payment or zero-rated. You must pay for eligible varieties. However, small farmers - as defined under EU law - are exempt and do not have to pay for their use of FSS can only use FSS that has been produced and saved within your own business - ie land farmed as the same business cannot market, sell, barter or transfer FSS outside your own holding These FSS rules always apply, whether the seed has been processed or taken straight from the barn. Reporting FSS use You can report your FSS use to the BSPB using any of these four methods: send back the declaration form in the envelope provided email the BSPB at fss@bspb.co.uk make an online declaration for combinable crops and/or potatoes on the BSPB website call the  BSPB Farm Saved Seed Helpline on Tel 01353 653 209 Who sets the payment rates on FSS ? FSS payment rates for each combinable crop species are published annually by the BSPB . These are based on the terms of an agreement between BSPB and the farming unions. The exception is potatoes where breeders set the rate individually by variety. Who collects FSS payments and where does the money go? BSPB collects FSS payments on behalf of plant breeders. Administration costs for the UK system amount to just seven pence per £1 collected, significantly less than equivalent systems in other EU member states. The remaining income is disbursed to individual plant breeders. How can farmers pay BSPB to collect FSS payments? There are two ways to pay BSPB for using eligible seed varieties: via your National Association of Agricultural Contractors or BSPB -registered seed processor as a component of the processing invoice at a tonnage rate - most farmers pay this way direct to the BSPB at a hectarage rate - for farmers who have not paid through their seed processor, or who have sown straight from the barn BSPB publishes tonnage and hectarage rates annually. See information on FSS declarations and payments on the Fair Play website . See information about FSS payments on the BSPB website . Contact BSPB BSPB is responsible for collecting FSS payments. You can contact the BSPB at the following address: British Society of Plant Breeders Ltd ( BSPB ) BSPB House 114 Lancaster Way Business Park Ely Cambs CB6 3NX You can also call the  BSPB Farm Saved Seed Helpline on 01353 653 209 or email them at fss@bspb.co.uk ."
/guidance/exporting-plants-to-non-eu-countries,"The documents and inspections you need to export plants and how much you'll have to pay. Exporting plants to non-EU countries Crops and horticulture  Animal and Plant Health Agency Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs You must follow this guidance if you want to export the following to non-EU countries from England and Wales: plants plant products, eg bulbs fruit and vegetables potatoes (including seed potatoes) seeds soil agricultural machinery - the machinery may have prohibited soil, plant debris or seeds on it You must follow other guidance if you’re exporting grain . Documents you need Plant health certificates You need to get a plant health certificate from the Animal and Plant Health Agency ( APHA ) to export plants and plant materials to most non-EU countries. You must send this with your consignment. Contact APHA for detailed information about the documents you need to export your consignment. Plant health certificates are also known as phytosanitary certificates. Import permits Some countries require that your consignment travels with an import permit as well as a plant health certificate. You should ask the recipient whether you need an import permit, and have them send it to you. Contact APHA for help in meeting the conditions it sets out. Exporting previously imported material You need a re-forwarding plant health certificate if you’re exporting material which came into England or Wales from a non-EU country with a plant health certificate and was then stored, repacked, or split up. Contact APHA to get a re-forwarding certificate - send them a copy of the original plant health certificate and they can tell you if the material must be inspected or tested. When you need an inspection You must have the following materials inspected by APHA at your site, to get a plant health certificate: plants and plant products bulbs fruit and vegetables (including seed and ware potatoes) grain farm machinery seeds for sowing In most cases, the inspectors will check for: pests and diseases prohibited weed seeds parasitic plants Inspections on seed for sowing (other than seed potatoes) APHA inspectors will usually take samples from the batch of seeds you plan to export and test them for pests and diseases in an APHA laboratory. You’ll get a plant health certificate for the full batch of seeds if the tests show they’re free from pests and diseases. Certificates are valid for 2 years from the date of the test - you can only use them to export seeds from the batch that was certified. A small number of countries also require your seed consignments and surrounding storage areas to be free from storage pests in order for them to be imported. APHA will tell you if this is necessary and they may visit your site to inspect the storage and consignment areas. Growing season inspections You may need to have your plants inspected by APHA in growing season, to make sure they’re free from pests and diseases which wouldn’t show up in tests at the time you’re exporting. You’ll usually have to do this if you’re exporting plants in the dormant state or flower bulbs. When you can take samples yourself You can send processed plant products to the APHA lab for inspection instead of having inspectors visit your premises, for example: peas tea or tea leaves tobacco cardboard dried cereal flakes APHA will test the material to make sure it meets the plant health regulations in the importing country. You’ll get a plant health certificate in 7 days if it does. Contact APHA if you’re unsure whether you can take samples of plant products yourself or not. Testing soil and washing roots Some countries require your plant health certificate to show that the soil or growing medium your plants are in is free from certain pests and diseases. This usually applies to plants with roots grown in soil - contact APHA to find out which countries demand this test. Some countries, eg USA, Australia and New Zealand also require you to wash soil and growing medium from the roots of all plants - contact APHA to check if you need to do this. To arrange for APHA to take soil samples, complete and return form PH13 - allow 2 weeks before the date you plan to export. Apply for inspection and certification Download and complete the relevant form to apply for inspection or certification. bulbs plants potatoes seeds used farm machinery growing season inspection soil sampling for potato cyst nematode plant material for re-forwarding Send the completed form to your local APHA office unless it tells you to send it to a specific APHA laboratory. Site inspections in different districts If you need inspectors to check materials at sites that are in different districts, you must complete separate application forms for each site. For the purposes of this guidance, a district in England is a civil parish or a district ward if there’s no civil parish - a district in Wales or Scotland is a community. How long certification takes You’ll usually get certification within 7 days of the APHA receiving your application form. It’ll take longer if there are mistakes on your form. Use existing test results to get certified If you’re taking part in the Plant Health Propagation Scheme ( PHPS ) or the Seed Potato Classification Scheme ( SPCS ) , you may be able to use the results you have from these to get a plant health certificate for exporting materials. Contact APHA to arrange to do this. Fees The fee you must pay depends on the services you need and how long they take. You have to pay for the time it takes an inspector to get to your site as well as the time spent on inspection and testing results. Inspectors can give you an estimate of fees before they start the work. Inspection and tests It costs £65.24 for each 15 minutes that the inspection on your site and testing of materials takes. The minimum cost of any inspection followed by tests is £130.48. Laboratory tests It costs £36.35 to send materials to an APHA laboratory for testing. Certificate with no inspection or laboratory test It costs £13.87 to get a plant health certificate if you don’t need an inspection or laboratory examination. Growing season inspection and soil sampling It costs £49.68 for every 15 minutes of a growing season inspection, or a potato cyst nematodes test on soil samples. The minimum fee is £99.36. You’ll also have to pay for any sampling or scientific tests that you need the APHA to do for your plants to meet the importing country’s health requirements. Reduced fees for small exporters You only have to pay half the usual fee for the first £250 of APHA services in a financial year, if you meet either of the following conditions: you’re not registered for VAT your certified exports or sales for certified export were worth less than £5,000 in the previous financial year Complete the application for export services at concessionary rates and send it to APHA to apply for a reduced fee. If you register for VAT at any point in the financial year, you must contact APHA to tell them you’ll no longer be eligible for the concession. If you’re eligible for the discount because the value of your exports was less than £5,000 in the previous financial year, you must tell the APHA if you expect your exports to amount to more than this by the end of the current financial year. Your discount will then last until 1 April, the first day of the new financial year. How to pay The APHA will send you an invoice within 30 days of inspection - it’ll tell you how much you have to pay.

Restrictions on trade to the Russian Federation In August 2014 the Russian Federation introduced a ban on the import of some agricultural commodities from the whole of the EU including the UK. This includes fruit and vegetables. The Russian Federation has extended this ban until August 2016 . If you are exporting products to the Russian Federation from the UK, which were originally from outside the EU, you are advised to request a phytosanitary certificate from the original country’s plant health authority before exporting the consignment to the EU - even if your product does not need a certificate to enter the EU. The certificate can then accompany your consignment, with any other documents, to prove the origin of the products."

Plant Health Propagation Scheme Crops and horticulture  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Animal and Plant Health Agency The Plant Health Propagation Scheme ( PHPS ) encourages the production and use of healthy planting stock. It’s a voluntary scheme run by the Animal and Plant Health Agency ( APHA ) certifying plants that meet all the scheme conditions. You can apply to join the PHPS to grow provenly healthy stock if you’re a commercial grower (‘propagator’) of: soft fruit - strawberries, berry fruit, currants top fruit - apples, pears, cherries, plums hops rootstocks and ornamental varieties associated with top fruit micropropagated material (of any crop) Apply for PHPS certification Any grower in England and Wales can apply to have their crops PHPS -certified. Your crops must be of known lineage unless you’re entering it at the lowest grade . All material must be grown under specific conditions relating to their site and isolation from other crops as explained in these guides: [InlineAttachment:2] [InlineAttachment:3] [InlineAttachment:4] [InlineAttachment:5] [InlineAttachment:6] [InlineAttachment:7] [InlineAttachment:1] Use the Nuclear Stock Association’s application forms to enter stocks into PHPS . If you’re entering planting material only for the CAC grade you must register with APHA to issue plant passports . Inspections Crops are inspected at least once a year by APHA Plant Health and Seeds Inspector to check they meet the standards set out in the guides . Assessments are normally made on the basis of visual examinations, but samples may be taken for laboratory analysis to get a definitive diagnosis. If a stock fails an inspection, APHA may tell the the propagator they can take remedial action (eg by removing plants that don’t meet the scheme standards) and request an additional inspection. Certification If the crop meets all the conditions set out in the guides , they’ll get PHPS certification. Certification details are published in the PHPS Annual Register . Grading system You enter your crop to meet one of these grades: Foundation Super Elite Elite A The Approved-Health (A-H) grade is available for crops which are inspected for health and vigour only. Crops which can’t meet the entry requirements for any PHPS grades are designated CAC Grade which means that they meet basic plant passport standards. Fees APHA will set up a contract if you grow PHPS -certified stock and will charge you for any certification visits. Any samples submitted to support inspections will be handled by the FERA (Food and Environment Research Agency) Plant Clinic who will invoice you. Fruit plant certification scheme There will be a statutory certification scheme for fruit plants from 1 January 2017.

Most cases have been reported in the United Kingdom, where the epidemic has been consistent with that of the BSE epidemic. Some other countries (e.g. Norway, Liechtenstein and France) have also reported cases. Most cases have been reported in domestic cats but there have also been cases in captive exotic cats (e.g. cheetah, lion, asian, leopard cat, ocelot, puma and tiger). TSE in exotic ruminants TSEs have been detected in exotic ruminants in zoos in the United Kingdom since 1986. These include antelopes, Ankole cattle and bison. The 1986 case in a Nyala antelope was diagnosed before the first case of BSE was identified. The statistics show that the number of cases have declined since the late 1990s. This is due to the controls on animal feed and the disposal of specified risk material and animal by-products."

Import and export licences International freight industry and businesses making customs declarations Closed organisation: Department for Business, Innovation & Skills Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Home Office HM Revenue & Customs Health and Safety Executive Animal and Plant Health Agency Goods which may require import and export licences If your business is considering exporting or importing goods, you will need to check if you need a licence. There are controls on exports of military or paramilitary goods, technology, artworks, plants and animals, medicines and chemicals. Licence requirements may depend on the potential use of the item - eg if it has a military application (usually referred to as dual-use goods) and where you are exporting to. There are also controls on imports including firearms, plants and animals, foods, medicines, textiles and chemicals. Whether you need a licence can also depend on where the goods are coming from. Exporting or importing controlled goods without the right licence is a criminal offence, so it’s important to check first. You may need a licence even if you are only exporting or importing goods temporarily - eg taking a sample to an exhibition. Licences for dual-use technology, security, firearms or defence goods Restrictions on the export of technology and defence goods do not just apply to weapons or military hardware. They also apply to goods that are designed for civil use but can be used for military purposes, usually referred to as dual-use goods - items such as machine tools, computers and marine equipment. There are also some restrictions on moving military goods between third countries, ie not involving the UK. If you’re planning to export anything with a potential military use you should always seek advice on whether a licence is required. For further information, read Export controls: an introductory guide or email the Department for Business, Innovation & Skills ( BIS ) Export Control Organisation at eco.help@bis.gsi.gov.uk  to check whether restrictions are likely to apply. As well as applying to specific types of products, restrictions also apply to certain destinations - in particular those to which trade sanctions and arms embargoes apply. To keep updated about current arms embargoes and changes to strategic export control legislation, you can subscribe to receive the ECO ’s Notices to Exporters . Watch a video about your export control responsibilities and how you can ensure you have the correct licences . The following licences are available for strategic controlled goods: Open General Licence ( OGL ) An OGL allows the export of specific goods by any exporter to a range of destinations. Open licences may be available for less restricted controlled items. You must register for these licences and adhere to all terms and conditions. If you cannot fulfil all the terms and conditions you will need to apply for a Standard Individual Export Licence, as detailed below. Standard Individual Export Licence An SIEL allows the export of a quantity of specified goods to a specified importer as set out in the licence. Open Individual Export Licence This is specific to an individual exporter and allows multiple shipments of specified goods to specified destinations. It is a concessionary form of licence available to exporters with a track record in export licence applications only. SPIRE is the Export Control Organisation’s online database for processing licence applications. You must use it to apply for any of the licences processed by the Export Control Organisation within BIS . Imports Importers must be registered firearms dealers and have the appropriate licence from BIS to accompany firearms and ammunition. Find more information on the Import Licensing Branch in our guide to import controls . Do you need an export or import licence for animals and animal products? The exportation of live animals and animal products such as meat, dairy goods, pet food and wool is the responsibility of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs ( Defra ). Defra is often required by the importing country’s veterinary authorities to provide certain animal health, public health and animal welfare assurances. It does this by producing export documents - typically a veterinary health certificate. These certificates usually require a consignment to be inspected by a Defra -approved veterinarian shortly before export to confirm that the necessary assurances can be met. The regulations that apply to a particular export vary widely. Factors such as the destination country, the species, the nature of the animal products and the intended use of the consignment all influence the conditions that must be met. Because of the array of live animals and meat that can be exported, different regulations apply to different species. In most instances however, there are standards in place for the care, treatment and processing of animals. You can call the Defra Helpline on Telephone: 08459 33 55 77. Businesses wishing to export live animals are responsible for: conforming to the appropriate import conditions for their consignment with the authorities in the importing country - consignments that do not meet a country’s import rules could be refused entry, returned or destroyed allowing enough time for the certification process to be completed before the export takes place - it usually takes about ten days for a certificate to be produced and some require certain conditions to have been met for a month, or sometimes considerably longer, before departure ensuring that their consignment meets any relevant UK rules, as well as those of the importing country Application forms for export health certificates can be obtained from your local Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency ( AHVLA ) office. You can locate your nearest AHVLA  office by calling the Defra Helpline on Telephone: 08459 33 55 77. Read information on the trade of animals and animal products within the European Union (EU) on the Defra website . Find more information on live animal and meat exports in general on the Defra website . Imports of animals and captive birds Imports of animals and captive birds (excluding pet birds, poultry and birds destined for approved institutes and zoos) are controlled by the issuing of animal health certificates and post-import veterinary inspections. Captive birds arriving into England are also required to be taken to an approved quarantine centre for assessment and testing. Additional controls apply to endangered birds and animals. Read about importing pet birds from the European Union on the Defra website . Imports of food are also controlled and must comply with regulations such as food safety, packaging, labelling and additives. Imports of organic food may also need authorisation before they can be marketed as organic. Read about imports of organic food on the Defra website . Export and import licences for objects of cultural interest - including antiques and works of art The Arts Council has responsibility for issuing export licences for objects of cultural interest which includes antiques and works of art. You will need an export licence to export certain objects of cultural interest that are more than 50 years old and above certain financial thresholds. For example, you’ll need to apply for a licence if you want to export a book that’s more than 100 years old and worth more than £65,000 to another European Union country. For further information,  read about export licensing for antiques and works of art on the Arts Council website . Export or import licences for prescription drugs and medicines and materials used to manufacture them Anyone wanting to export prescription drugs or medicines should contact the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency ( MHRA ), an agency of the Department of Health. The MHRA issues four types of export certificate: certificate of a pharmaceutical product - which includes detailed information about the product certificate of manufacturing status - which certifies that a manufacturing licence is held certificate of licensing status - which can be issued for licensed and unlicensed products, contains less information than a certificate of a pharmaceutical product and can list up to ten products per certificate certificate for the importation of a pharmaceutical constituent - which certifies if a chemical can be used as an ingredient of a pharmaceutical product in the UK Read about the export of medicines and access export application forms on the MHRA website or MHRA Export Section Enquiry Line on Telephone: 020 3080 6593. Anyone wishing to export controlled drugs will generally require licensing from the Home Office Drugs and Firearms Licensing Unit. Find out about export licenses for controlled drugs on the Home Office website . Imports of medicinal products Imports of medicinal products are subject to licensing. See the guidance for wholesale dealers on the MHRA website . Read about importing unlicensed medicines on the MHRA website . Anyone wishing to import controlled drugs will generally require licensing from the Home Office Drugs and Firearms Licensing Unit. Read about import licences on the Home Office website . Do you need an export or import licence for flowers, wildlife, plants and seeds? To prevent the spread of pests and diseases, the Food and Environment Research Agency ( Fera ) is responsible for making sure that the export of flowers, wildlife, plants and seeds meets the requirements of importing countries. If you’re exporting such items to a country outside the European Union (EU), find your nearest plant health and seed inspector contact details on the Fera website . An inspector will be able to help ensure that you meet the requirements of the country to which you’re exporting. However, if you’re exporting to countries within the EU, you may require a ‘plant passport’. This depends on the type of items you want to export and the nature of your business. Find plant health information and advice on the movement of plants on the Fera website . Find a list of the various import and export forms you can download on the Fera website . Imports of plants Imports of plants are controlled by the issuing of phytosanitary certificates. Further controls apply to some endangered plants. Download a guide to plant passports from the Fera website (PDF, 1.6MB) . Imports of wood and wood packaging material are controlled. Read about imports of wood and wood packaging on the Forestry Commission website . Do you need an export or import licence for chemicals and pesticides? Exports of chemicals and pesticides If you’re planning to export certain pesticides or hazardous chemicals outside of the European Union (EU) you may need to go through a notification procedure and, in some cases, obtain prior informed consent ( PIC ) from the importing country before the export can take place. This procedure is overseen by the Health & Safety Executive ( HSE ), which makes sure that: chemicals are exported at least six months before their expiry date exports of chemicals that have a severely restricted use within the EU have complied with a mandatory notification procedure no chemicals are exported that are banned within the EU exports to countries outside the EU are packaged and labelled in line with the United Nations’ Open General Licence Globally Harmonised System ( GHS ) - read about GHS on the HSE website Find further information about the PIC procedure on the HSE website . Find a list of chemicals subject to  PIC procedure on the EDEXIM (European Database of Export and Import of certain dangerous chemicals) database on the European Chemicals Bureau website . An export licence is required to export so-called dual-use goods which are controlled for ‘strategic’ reasons. The list of dual-use goods includes chemicals. These are controlled because of the UK’s commitments under the Chemical Weapons Convention and European Union dual-use legislation. Imports of pesticides and chemicals Importers of dangerous chemicals must identify the hazards, provide information about them under the Classification, Labelling and Packaging of chemical substances and mixtures ( CLP ) regulations and ensure they package the product safely.  Find out about CLP obligations on the European Chemicals Agency ( ECHA ) website . Under Registration, Evaluation, and Authorisation of Chemicals ( REACH ) legislation, importers or manufacturers of more than one tonne of chemicals a year must also register with the European Chemicals Agency. Read about REACH legislation on the  HSE website . Read about the Notification of New Substances Regulations on the HSE website . Imports of some dangerous products such as asbestos are prohibited or require special authorisation. Defra also controls trade in ozone-depleting substances ( ODS ). To import ODS , you must have a licence from the European Commission under Regulation (EC) No 1005/2009. You can request a licence from the European Commission using their online ODS -database on the Europa website . Do you need an export or import licence for vehicles? If you are exporting an ordinary vehicle that is less than 50 years old, you do not generally need an export licence. However, you must notify the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency ( DVLA ). Normally you use your Registration Document (V5) or Registration Certificate (V5C) to let  DVLA know when you intend to export the vehicle. For more information, see the guide ‘Taking a vehicle out of the UK’ . You do not need to notify the DVLA if you are taking your vehicle out of the country for less than a year, but you must take your registration document or certificate with you. Imports of vehicles You do not generally need a licence to import an ordinary vehicle. However, the vehicle must be registered and have a valid vehicle licence (tax disc) before being used or kept on public roads. For more information, see the guide ‘Importing vehicles into the UK’ . Other import licences and controls The Department for Business, Innovation & Skills ( BIS ) also issue import licences for a small number of goods.  Find out which goods require a BIS import licence on the BIS website . Other controls may apply to the goods you are importing. For example, imports of food are controlled and food products must also comply with regulations such as food safety, labelling and additives. Imports of organic food may also need authorisation before they can be marketed as organic.  Read about imports of organic food on the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs ( Defra ) website .

/guidance/compensation-for-animals-culled-to-control-animal-diseases,"Find out about compensation arrangements for animals culled by the government as part of certain disease control strategies. Compensation for animals culled to control animal diseases Reporting disease and disease outbreaks Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Animal and Plant Health Agency The government has powers to cull (kill) animals to control the spread of some animal diseases. You will generally receive compensation for any healthy animals culled, and you may also receive compensation for animals affected by the disease in question. You generally won’t receive any compensation for animals that: die before they are culled you voluntarily kill independently of an official cull You won’t be compensated for consequential losses (income that the animal would have generated in the future, for example through laying eggs or producing offspring). How compensation is calculated for bovine TB and certain other cattle diseases The Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs ( Defra ) uses market prices to calculate compensation for cattle culled to control the spread of bovine tuberculosis (TB) and the following diseases: bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) brucellosis enzootic bovine leukosis Every month Defra publishes a table of compensation values (average market price for same category cattle) for 51 different categories of cattle. The categories are based on an animal’s: age and sex pedigree status type (eg beef or dairy) Sales data for around 1.5 million cattle are collected each year to make sure the table values adequately reflect market prices. For non-pedigree animals 1 month of price data is used to calculate compensation. For pedigree animals 6 months of price data is used. You can look at cattle compensation values for the current month and past months. Almost all cases of TB compensation is determined using table valuations. If there isn’t enough sales data for a particular category of cattle in any month, compensation will be determined by using: the most recently available table value for that category, or a valuation provided by a valuer appointed by the government For BSE, brucellosis and enzootic bovine leukosis compensation is paid for any animals culled, including animals affected by the diseases. For bovine TB compensation may be reduced for reactor cattle from herds with overdue TB tests. All animals in an approved finishing unit ( AFU ), licensed finishing unit ( LFU ) or a (pre-movement testing) exempt finishing unit ( EFU ) are destined for slaughter only and have no breeding potential. Therefore, for the purposes of valuation, any cattle in an AFU , LFU or EFU are classed as commercial and compensation is paid according to the relevant valuation table for non-pedigree animals. How compensation is calculated for certain diseases of poultry (kept birds) Defra uses poultry valuation tables to calculate compensation for poultry culled to control the spread of the following diseases: Salmonella (in breeding chicken and turkey flocks) avian influenza Newcastle disease For avian influenza and Newcastle disease you will only receive compensation for healthy birds that are culled. You won’t be compensated for birds affected by disease. For Salmonella you will be compensated for all birds culled, except for those birds classed as rejects when the flock is killed at a slaughter house. Any money you receive from the slaughter house, or from an insurance policy that covers loss as a result of disease, will be subtracted from your compensation. The valuation tables take into account several factors including: the species, age and sex of the bird what it was farmed for (eg meat or eggs) the cost of rearing the birds any income derived from the birds (eg from production of hatching eggs) Tables for 36 different types of birds are updated quarterly, along with a [InlineAttachment:2]. The current tables are: [InlineAttachment:3] [InlineAttachment:4] [InlineAttachment:5] [InlineAttachment:6] [InlineAttachment:7] [InlineAttachment:8] [InlineAttachment:9] [InlineAttachment:10] [InlineAttachment:11] [InlineAttachment:12] [InlineAttachment:13] [InlineAttachment:14] [InlineAttachment:15] [InlineAttachment:16] [InlineAttachment:17] [InlineAttachment:18] [InlineAttachment:19] [InlineAttachment:20] [InlineAttachment:21] [InlineAttachment:22] [InlineAttachment:23] [InlineAttachment:24] [InlineAttachment:25] [InlineAttachment:26] [InlineAttachment:27] [InlineAttachment:28] [InlineAttachment:29] [InlineAttachment:30] [InlineAttachment:31] [InlineAttachment:32] [InlineAttachment:33] [InlineAttachment:34] [InlineAttachment:35] [InlineAttachment:36] [InlineAttachment:37] [InlineAttachment:38] [InlineAttachment:39] [InlineAttachment:40] [InlineAttachment:41] Some types of bird, such as pedigree birds and grandparent breeding flocks, aren’t included in the tables. In such cases the government will appoint a valuer to set compensation. Compensation arrangements for other diseases You may be entitled to compensation if your animals are culled as part of a strategy to control another notifiable disease . Compensation may be reduced, or not apply, to animals affected with the disease. During an outbreak of an exotic notifiable disease (a notifiable disease that isn’t currently present in Great Britain) information on compensation arrangements would be published on this website."
/guidance/protecting-plant-health-topical-issues,"EU emergency measures against Xylella fastidiosa and current issues related to protecting plant health and trade of plants, fruit, vegetables or plant material. Protecting plant health: topical issues Crops and horticulture  Animal and Plant Health Agency New EU emergency measures against Xylella fastidiosa, a bacterial disease of plants To help protect EU Member States against the introduction of Xylella fastidiosa, EU emergency legislation has been introduced, which includes requirements to protect against introductions from non-EU countries, as well as from those parts of the EU where it is has been detected. New requirements for imports of non-EU plants have been introduced and movements of ‘specified plants’ (which includes the confirmed hosts of Xylella fastidiosa in the EU and further afield) are only possible from areas in the EU where the pathogen is present if stringent conditions are met. The plant health authorities in the UK and elsewhere are also carrying out surveillance for the pathogen. The EU Plant Health Standing Committee has recently updated the emergency measures against this pathogen, to reflect the evolving situation in Italy and France, and to improve preparedness within the EU more generally. EU Decision 2015/789 from May 2015 regarding measures to prevent the introduction into and the spread within the Union of Xylella fastidiosa has been amended by Decision 2015/2417 which came into force on 19 December 2015. For further information, see the following documents: [InlineAttachment:1] List of host plants susceptible to Xylella fastidiosa in the EU List of demarcated areas in both France, including Corsica, and Italy due to the presence of the pathogen Consolidated EU Xylella fastidiosa host list Ban on importing some plant products originating in Ghana The current legislation suspending imports of certain products from Ghana expires at the end of 2016. An EU audit took place in September 2016 which has shown that there are still significant shortcomings in the export system in Ghana and in addition EU member states (including the UK) are continuing to intercept harmful organisms on Ghanaian material. As a result it is likely that this legislation will be extended for a further period (possibly a year, but to be decided). This applies to imports of plant material (other than seeds) of: Capsicum (sweet and Chili peppers) Lagenaria (bottle gourd) Luffa Momordica L (bitter gourd) Solanum L. (including aubergines), other than S. lycopersicum L (tomato) Lifting of ban on the import of some plant products originating in India As a result of a significant reduction in the interception of harmful organisms on Indian material and evidence of improvements to the phytosanitary control of exports from India, it is proposed to let the current EU legislation suspending 4 products (Colocasia sp, Momordica sp, Solanum melongena and Trichosanthes sp) expire at the end of 2016. Restrictions on the import of curry leaves Fresh curry leaves can only be imported from countries able to fulfil the requirements of the EU import regulations. This includes the need to originate from countries recognised as free of citrus greening disease. Currently there are no countries that have satisfied this requirement and so fresh curry leaves are not permitted to be imported into the EU. If curry leaves are imported they must be either frozen or dried at time of import. Restrictions on trade to the Russian Federation In August 2014 the Russian Federation introduced a ban on the import of some agricultural commodities from the whole of the EU including the UK. This includes fruit and vegetables. The Russian Federation had extended the ban to August 2016, but the ban is now on-going. If you are exporting products to the Russian Federation from the UK, which were originally from outside the EU, you are advised to request a phytosanitary certificate from the original country’s plant health authority before exporting the consignment to the EU - even if your product does not need a certificate to enter the EU. The certificate can then accompany your consignment, with any other documents, to prove the origin of the products."
/guidance/plant-health-controls,"Plant health controls, imports and exports, certification schemes, plant passporting and listed quarantine plant pests. Plant health controls  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Animal and Plant Health Agency Apply online for plant health services using eDomero Introduction There are many pests and diseases that can seriously damage crops and plants in the UK. To protect plant health, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) sets policy and enforces controls and restrictions on the import, movement and keeping of certain plants, plant pests and other materials such as soil. The Plant Health and Seeds Inspectorate ( PHSI ) is part of the Animal and Plant Health Agency ( APHA ) and implements and enforces plant health policy in England, and in Wales on behalf of the Welsh Government. If you want to grow, import, export or move certain plants or plant material, you will need to use the PHSI ’s services. Legislation Plant health legislation controls the import and movement of certain plants, seeds and organic matter - such as soil - and certain plant products, including fruit, potatoes, vegetables, cut flowers, foliage and grain. Controls differ according to the species - and whether or not they are classified as quarantine organisms - but could include the need for classification, a phytosanitary certificate, a plant passport and/or inspection requirements. There are two main elements of plant health control relevant to growers and crop farmers: protection against quarantine organisms - measures to prevent the introduction and spread of harmful plant pests and diseases which are not established in the European Union certification - ensures that high-quality planting material which is free from specific pests and diseases is available to growers If you find or suspect a quarantine organism, you must contact your local PHSI office immediately. You should also check our topical issues page for current issues related to plant health and the trade of plants, fruit, vegetables or plant material. Imports Some plants and plant produce are prohibited from entering this country from outside the EU while others must meet certain requirements and be accompanied by a phytosanitary certificate. Importers must check if a plant or plant product requires phytosanitary certification to be allowed entry into the EU. You must register with Defra before you import any controlled plants or plant products. These certificates confirm that the goods have been inspected in their country of origin and meet EU standards on the absence of pests and diseases.

Read the guidance on importing trees and plants to England and Wales from the EU Read the Forestry Commission guidance on importing timber and wood. Exports The PHSI provide a range of chargeable services to help you export plants, plant products, fruit and vegetables, seeds, soil or agricultural machinery to countries outside the EU. All material must satisfy the plant health requirements of the importing country. Read the guidance on exporting plants to non-EU countries . Read the guidance on exporting grain to non-EU countries . Requirements for forestry and wood are covered by Plant Health (Forestry) legislation.

Application forms Bulbs Grain: certification of consignments Grain: phytosanitary certification Grain: certificate of treatment Plants Plant products Potatoes Seeds Used farm machinery Application for concessionary rates Growing season inspection Soil sampling for potato cyst nematode Plant material for re-forwarding Certification schemes Certification is one of the two key elements of plant health control along with requirements on quarantine organisms. Certification schemes ensure that growers and farmers have access to high-quality planting material to meet prescribed standards on freedom from plant pests and diseases. The statutory Seed Potato Classification Scheme ( SPCS ) ensures that seed potatoes marketed meet the specified standards. It also protects purchasers by ensuring that seed potatoes are healthy, good quality, true to variety and free from mixtures. The Plant Health Propagation Scheme ( PHPS ) is a voluntary scheme which promotes the production and use of healthy, proven planting stock. It covers soft fruit (e.g. strawberries, berry fruit, currants), top fruit (e.g. apples, pears, cherries, plums), hops, cobnuts and bulbs (e.g. narcissus and iris). Quarantine pests Requirements on quarantine pests and diseases are one of the two key elements of plant health control, along with certification. Quarantine measures help to keep foreign pests out of areas where they could damage crops, trees, wild plants and ecosystems. Under plant health legislation a number of plant pests and diseases are classified as quarantine organisms and are therefore subject to statutory control. For further information about pests and diseases, see the Defra Risk Register/Plant Health Portal . Demarcated zones Potato brown rot Potato brown rot is a serious bacterial disease of potato which is not present in the UK but is a threat to the potato industry. APHA annually monitors potatoes and has a programme of sampling watercourses to check for the organism (Ralstonia solanacearum) which causes potato brown rot. Restrictions are put in place if the organism is found. For watercourses this means that the irrigation and spraying of potato and tomato crops is only possible using an approved method, such as winter abstraction and storage, or water treatment. Growers or companies interested in developing or using an approved technique must first contact APHA . See the [InlineAttachment:13]. What to do if you identify a quarantine pest or disease Early identification is important to help combat quarantine pests and diseases. If you find a quarantine organism or suspect one may be present, you should contact your local PHSI immediately to alert them. For information on tree-related notifiable pests and diseases, you can call the Forestry Commission helpline on 0300 067 5049 or the Forestry Commission Wales on 0300 068 0300. Plant passports If you’re based in England and Wales and you’re moving plants or plant products in the EU that can host quarantine pests and diseases, they may need plant passports. Plant passports may only be issued by businesses who are registered and authorised for the purpose. Read the guidance on issuing plant passports to trade plants in the EU . Application for authorisation to issue plant passports; and fireblight buffer zone status [InlineAttachment:8] Scientific licences It may be possible to import, move and keep normally prohibited material into England and Wales under the authority of a licence issued by APHA , subject to detailed quarantine and containment conditions.

If Species+ says the animal is banned, you can’t export the product. There are special rules for ivory, rhino horn and certain other animal products . Within the EU If the animal is classed as B, C or D, you don’t need to do anything. If it’s classed as Annex A, you must apply for an Article 10 certificate unless any of the following apply: your goods are antiques made before 1947 you’re giving your goods away you’re using or displaying goods for non-commercial reasons like scientific research or in an educational display Apply for an Article 10 certificate Fill in the application form for the Article 10 certificate. Email it to wildlife.licensing@apha.gsi.gov.uk or post it to the Centre for International Trade Bristol . Include any supporting documents that show you acquired the product legally, for example: a copy of the import permit a previous Article 10 certificate (use the yellow copy) The certificate costs £31. You should get your certificate within 15 working days. Outside the EU If it’s classed as A, B or C, you need a CITES export permit. If it’s classed as D, check the animal’s CITES listing in the Species+ tool. If it’s in Appendix III, you’ll need a CITES export permit. Otherwise, you don’t need to do anything. Apply for a CITES export permit Fill in the application form (PDF, 98.5KB) for a CITES permit Email or post the completed form to the Centre for International Trade Bristol . A permit costs £63 (or £37 to re-export). You should receive it within 15 working days. If you regularly travel with musical instruments made from endangered animals (for example ivory piano keys) that you intend to bring back to the UK, you may not need a permit. Contact the Centre for International Trade in Bristol to check. Ivory, rhino horn and other animal products with special rules There are special rules for products made with elephant ivory, rhino horn, tigers and their parts and derivatives, bear bile, bear paws and gallbladders, and eggs of native British birds. They can only be exported in special cases like for scientific research, if they’re family heirlooms or valuable artworks. Check with APHA to find out if you can export these products. You could be fined or imprisoned for up to 7 years if you break the rules. If you need help Contact the Centre for International Trade in Bristol if you need any help."

If it’s classed as Annex A, you must apply for an Article 10 certificate unless either: the plant is artificially propagated you’re exporting the plant for non-commercial reasons like scientific research, educational display or because you’re giving it away Apply for an Article 10 certificate Fill in the application form for the Article 10 certificate. Email it to wildlife.licensing@apha.gsi.gov.uk or post it to the Centre for International Trade Bristol . Include any supporting documents that show you acquired the product legally, for example: a copy of the import permit a previous Article 10 certificate (use the yellow copy) The certificate costs £31. Find out how to pay for your application. You should get your certificate within 15 working days. Outside the EU If it’s classed as A, B or C, you need a CITES export permit. If it’s classed as D, check the animal’s CITES listing in the Species+ tool. If it’s in Appendix III, you’ll need a CITES export permit. Otherwise you don’t need to do anything. Apply for a CITES permit Fill in the application form (PDF, 98.5KB) for a CITES permit If you’re re-exporting goods include supporting documents to prove it legally entered the EU . Email or post the completed form to APHA or DAERA in Northern Ireland. A permit costs £74 (or £59 to re-export). You should receive it within 15 working days. If you’re exporting as part of conservation work, you might be able to get a fee waiver (PDF, 98KB). Regular exports for public exhibition If you regularly take plants abroad for a short period of time for public exhibitions, check if you can use a travelling exhibition certificate (PDF, 2.5MB) instead of a CITES permit. You can use the certificate whether you’re moving goods within or outside the EU . It’s valid for 3 years and means you don’t need to apply for permission each time you take your display items abroad.​ Apply for a certificate by: completing the application form sending it to the address on the form You’ll get your certificate within 15 working days and there’s no fee. Prohibited plants and soil How you export prohibited plants and soil depends on whether you’re exporting within the EU or outside the EU . Within the EU You can’t usually move: plants listed under Annex III (PDF, 424KB) soil from outside Europe, and from Belarus, Moldova, Russia, Turkey or Ukraine As well as soil from these countries, you also can’t move other organic matter you can grow plants in, excluding: peat marine sediments pure sand, clay, talc, rocks, volcanic pumice or chalk Check the importer has scientific licence You can only send prohibited plants or soil to someone who has a scientific licence to receive them. They will have a ‘letter of authority’ with their licence. You must: ask the recipient to send you a copy of their ‘letter of authority’ send it to APHA to be endorsed attach the letter inside and outside all the packages once it’s been endorsed store prohibited the plants or soil in 3 layers of packaging - at least 1 of the layers must be escape and shatter-proof If the recipient tells you that you don’t need a letter of authority, ask for their official confirmation of this from their national plant protection organisation. Don’t send your material until you’ve got this. Outside the EU Contact APHA to find out what you need to do, including what the rules are in the country you’re exporting to."

/government/consultations/the-wine-regulations-2011,"These Regulations are the result of the 2008 EU Wine Reform where the UK secured major concessions for UK wine producers. The Wine Regulations 2011  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Summary These Regulations are the result of the 2008 EU Wine Reform where the UK secured major concessions for UK wine producers. They provide a basis for the UK to enforce the rules of the EU Wine Regime and ensure wine on sale in the UK has been produced correctly and is sold in a way that does not mislead the consumer. These Regulations will apply to the whole of the UK with revised application of the wine rules to provide for an improved balance of sanctions that can be applied where offences have been committed, and more relevant powers made available to enforcement authorities. They also embrace the wishes of UK producers by providing a basis for the amendment of the existing wine quality schemes in England and Wales by now recognising sparkling wines and safeguarding the reputation of UK wines as a whole. This is a joint consultation by Defra, Department of Agriculture and Rural Development Northern Ireland, Scottish Government and the Welsh Government.

/government/speeches/richard-benyon-s-speech-at-the-partnership-for-action-against-wildlife-crime-seminar,"Richard Benyon’s speech at the Partnership for Action Against Wildlife Crime Seminar.  Richard Benyon’s speech at the Partnership for Action Against Wildlife Crime Seminar  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs It’s good to be given the opportunity to speak to you today. And let me say straightaway that I am absolutely committed to doing whatever I can to help in the fight against wildlife crime. It is a privilege to be able to support your work. I have had an insight into what you do - both as a farmer and as Shadow Environment Minister. And in my time in Government I have been impressed by the activities and achievements of PAW partners. So I am delighted to be here today. The partnership is now in its sixteenth year. It is an excellent example of the Government’s Big Society vision. People are getting involved at every level, making a real difference in working together towards a shared goal - to reduce wildlife crime. This is important not just at the national level, but also to protect international biodiversity. It is vital that we continue this. We just have to look back over the last year to see what we’ve achieved. A man who took 14 peregrine eggs from nests in Wales and attempted to smuggle them out of the country by wrapping them in socks strapped to his body - was jailed for 18 months. A quick thinking cleaner at Birmingham airport spotted him behaving strangely and alerted counter-terrorism officers. I was really pleased to be able to meet the cleaner later on and to thank him personally - and the good news is that 11 of the eggs were successfully hatched and returned to the wild. A man who tried to sell a rhino horn on Ebay and who had been convicted of similar offences two years earlier - was given a nine month jail sentence. A man who trapped and drowned a badger was ordered to pay costs of just under £3,000. 5 men arrested in Sussex on suspicion of deer poaching were found guilty of firearms offences and given a mixture of suspended prison sentences and community sentences. All huge successes - which will have sent a clear message to criminals that wildlife crime is not a soft option and that they will be caught and prosecuted. But we cannot rest on our laurels. Consider these figures: In the last two years the National Wildlife Crime Unit received nearly three and a half thousand intelligence reports; There were over a hundred convictions; Over five hundred cases are currently under investigation. All are significantly higher than in the previous two years. And this may be just the tip of the iceberg. The National Wildlife Crime Unit has played a key role in our fight against wildlife crime. It has provided advice and expertise to support enforcement officers dealing with what are often complex cases. It has helped sharpen and target enforcement activity through intelligence collection and sharing, intelligence which provided a firm basis to set our wildlife crime priorities for the next two years. These priorities are: Crimes against badgers. The number of reports of badger persecution is rising and now accounts for a tenth of all the reports to the Unit. By working together you are raising awareness and stepping up education and prevention activities. CITES crimes. This year has seen a step change in CITES enforcement, with global operations tackling the illegal trade in traditional Chinese medicines and reptiles. These operations led to significant seizures but also revealed that CITES trade controls are not always complied with in the UK. We are already working with partners to address this. I visited the Animal Reception Centre at Heathrow airport last year and was amazed at the beauty of the birds and animals being imported - both legally and illegally. I was appalled to hear of the extremes smugglers will go to to make huge sums of money. They have little or no regard for the effect their activities are having - either on the welfare of the individual specimens concerned - or on the conservation of the species as a whole.   And then there are Freshwater Pearl Mussels. Many of us will not have come across them - but in conservation terms the UK has a significant proportion of the world’s population of Freshwater Pearl Mussels. These incredible creatures are at risk from pearl fishing and habitat destruction. Much has been done to raise awareness but illegal activity is continuing. The persecution of raptors will remain as a wildlife crime priority with particular attention to golden eagles, goshawks, hen harriers, red kites, white-tailed eagles and peregrines. I visited the Avon Gorge earlier this year and was privileged to see peregrines in flight. It was truly breathtaking. And I have heard they have nested at the House of Commons. I am pleased to see organisations like the Moorland Association working closely with other partners to tackle raptor persecution. Poaching will also remain a priority. More poaching incidents are reported to the Unit than any other wildlife crime and the numbers have increased by over a hundred per cent in the last two years. Bat Persecution. Property development causes the greatest threat to bats. Over half of the reported incidents related to development. Actions to tackle this are underway and have been given new impetus by the appointment of an investigations officer. The National Wildlife Crime Unit has played a key role in supporting the UK wildlife crime priorities and you will hear more about that later. But its role and influence go far beyond that. It has been able to share its expertise and experience in Europe and internationally. I want the Unit to continue to do all these things. Wildlife crime is a serious concern. At worst it can disturb the delicate balance of ecosystems and habitats and push endangered species closer to extinction. It can cause serious disturbance to rural communities trying to live peaceful lives. It is also often part of serious and organised wider crime picture. Thank you for all that you have done to tackle the wildlife crime priorities - on top of the many other priorities you face in your daily lives. There is still work to be done. And I recognise the leading role the Unit is playing. I am delighted to announce that the Government will continue to fund the Unit so that it can continue to build on the good work that it has done. But the Unit is just one part of the Partnership. Police, Customs officers and other enforcers carry out vital work on the ground - in the face of considerable difficulties - not least - reductions in funding. It is all the more important to make the best use of everyone’s skills and expertise, including PAW partners - through working together.    Thank you."

/government/news/330-million-for-new-flood-defences-in-kent-hampshire-sussex,"New flood defences will benefit Kent, Hampshire and Sussex to the tune of over £330 million, the government has announced today. £330 million for new flood defences in Kent, Hampshire & Sussex  Environment Agency HM Treasury Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Homes in Sandwich, Whitstable, Yalding and Shoreham-by-Sea will be better protected from floods thanks to an unprecedented six-year £2.3 billion flood defence programme. The new flood defence scheme in Shoreham-by-Sea, just one of 163 schemes in Kent, Hampshire and Sussex getting the green light today, is worth over £26 million and will protect thousands of homes. Some examples of the schemes funded in the first two year ‘construction’ phase in the area include: Middle Medway Strategy Broomhill Sands Tidal Defence Shoreham Adur Tidal Walls Portsea Island Danny Alexander, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury said: “The south coast saw terrible flooding last winter, so I have earmarked £300m of flood defence spending for vulnerable areas throughout Kent, Hampshire and Sussex. “Investing £2.3 billion to support 1,400 schemes across the country will protect 300,000 homes from the north-east to the south-west. As well as ensuring people’s safety and peace of mind it will also bring over £30 billion of economic benefit, making it great value for money as part of this government’s drive for a stronger economy and a fairer society.” Environment Secretary Elizabeth Truss said: “Flood protection is vital and under our plans Kent, Sussex and Hampshire will be better protected by 163 defence schemes across the region, including in Yalding, bringing peace of mind to residents and businesses. We are spending £3.2 billion in flood management and defences over the course of this parliament - half a billion pounds more than in the previous parliament. This, combined with the record level of investment in capital we have set out today, will improve protection to 465,000 homes and businesses by the end of the decade.” Environment Agency Chairman Sir Philip Dilley said: “Our priority is to do as much as we can with every pound of funding from government and local partners, we now expect to provide better flood protection to an additional 300,000 properties in England by the end of the decade.With one in six homes in England at risk of flooding, and recognising the risk of flooding can never be eliminated, we would also encourage people to take their own steps to prepare for flooding, for example by signing up to the Environment Agency’s free flood warning service.” This first ever long-term investment programme will protect over 60,000 properties in Kent, Hampshire and Sussex alone and save the national economy £2.7 billion by 2021. The lifetime benefits of this investment will be even higher at over £30bn. New schemes may also be added as the programme progresses. Since the beginning of this parliament flood defence investment has improved protection to over 230,000 homes and over 580,000 acres of land. The new will protect at least another 300,000 homes in England by the end of the decade. The investment programme was published alongside a new long term study from the Environment Agency which shows that the planned investment will reduce overall flood and coastal erosion risk in England.

/guidance/personal-food-plant-and-animal-product-imports,"Guidance for individual travellers bringing food or other products with a plant or animal origin into the UK for personal use, or receiving such products by post. Personal food, plant and animal product imports Advice for all countries Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Overview What products you can bring into the UK depends on where you are travelling from, and not where the products were produced or packaged. If you’re travelling from a country within the EU, you can bring any fresh foodstuffs - fruit, vegetables, meat, dairy or other animal products (eg fish, eggs and honey) - into the UK. When travelling from outside the EU, there are strict rules about bringing food products, plants and plant products back into the UK for your own personal consumption or use. This guide gives further details about the restrictions on other food products being imported for personal use, in luggage or by post or courier, and explains exactly which foodstuffs are exempt from the restrictions. It also gives additional details about some European (non-EU) countries and the restrictions that apply to them. Diseases like foot and mouth disease (FMD) and bird flu can be brought into the UK via animal products (particularly those containing meat or milk). Fruits and vegetables may carry pests that can infect plants and vegetables in the UK. Such diseases and pests can have a devastating effect on our farming livestock, crops and the environment. Animal-related products may also risk human health from diseases, residues or contaminants (eg from fish, honey, untreated animal hides). The risks can also be economic: the FMD outbreak in 2001 is estimated to have cost £3 billion relating to agriculture and the food chain. This guide does not cover produce taken from the UK to another country. You are strongly advised to check with the authorities of the country you want to export to, as only they can give you failsafe advice as to what is an acceptable and legal import into their country. Summary of restrictions From EU countries: You can bring any fruit, vegetables, meat, dairy or other animal products (eg fish, eggs and honey) into the UK if you’re travelling from a country within the EU. From non-EU countries the following items are banned: all meat and meat products all milk and dairy products potatoes From non-EU countries the following items are restricted: fruit and vegetables - no more than 2kg total weight combined per person travelling bivalves (live), egg products, eggs and honey fish, bivalves (dead) and fish/fishery products - no more than 20kg total weight (fish must be gutted if fresh, or processed, ie cooked, cured, dried or smoked) 2kg total weight combined per person - certain fruits and vegetables The rules apply to any products carried in your personal luggage or sent by post (including those ordered online) and even if they’re for yourself, bought in a shop (including at an airport), home-grown/made or vacuum packed. See Animals and animal products: international trade regulations . Eligible European countries The EU countries (excluding the UK) are Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal (including Azores and Madeira), Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain and Sweden. The Community customs territory includes Andorra, Canary Islands, Channel Islands, Isle of Man, Liechtenstein, Norway, San Marino and Switzerland. These countries also count as EU countries in this context. Ineligible European countries Although Gibraltar is part of the EU, it is outside the Community customs territory so is therefore treated as a non-EU country. Though the whole of Cyprus is part of the EU, goods from any area of Cyprus not under the effective control of the Government of the Republic of Cyprus are treated as non-EU imports. Faeroe Islands, Greenland and Iceland are dealt with in the section below, Food from outside the EU . Additional restrictions For certain protected species, additional restrictions may apply for products brought or sent from Andorra, Canary Islands, Channel Islands, Isle of Man, Liechtenstein, Norway, San Marino and Switzerland. caviar of sturgeon species: 125 grams per person: If you wish to send by post, regardless of the amount, or bring in more than 125 grams in your personal luggage you must have the correct CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species) permits, or all of the product will be seized.  Please contact the UK CITES Management Authority on 0117 372 8774, including if you need confirmation as to whether the caviar in question is listed as an endangered species. Food from outside the EU: details of restrictions Note that though the whole of Cyprus is part of the EU, goods from any area of Cyprus not under the effective control of the government of the Republic of Cyprus are treated as non-EU imports. For restrictions from Faeroe Islands, Greenland and Iceland, see sections below. Meat and dairy products (other than powdered infant milk, infant food, special foods and special pet feed required for medical reasons) Not permitted Powdered infant milk, infant food, special foods and special pet feed required for medical reasons* 2kg total weight per person travelling Special pet feed required for medical reasons* 2kg total weight per person travelling *provided that in both cases: the product does not require refrigeration before consumption the product is in commercially branded packaging the packaging is unbroken unless in current use Fish/fishery products/bivalves (dead) 20 kg total weight per person travelling or the weight of one fish, whichever weight is the highest Fresh fish must be gutted. Fishery products include: processed fish (dried, cooked, cured or smoked) lobsters and prawns caviar not from certain protected species eg salmon caviar Bivalves (dead) include: mussels oysters Other animal products 2 kg total weight per person travelling Other animal products include: bivalves (live) eg mussels and oysters eggs/egg products frogs’ legs (hind part of the frog with the skin/internal organs removed) honey insect meat snail meat (edible land snails, shelled) Frogs’ legs must be the back (ie the hind) part of the frog with the skin/internal organs removed. If the skin/internal organs are still attached, the frogs’ legs are not permitted. May be fresh, chilled, frozen or processed. Snails must be shelled, cooked and prepared/preserved meat of edible land snails, including canned snailmeat, and snail shells re-filled with snail meat. Live snails, dead snails still in their shells and water snails are not permitted. In accordance with Commission Decision 2005/692/EC (as amended) which imposes certain protection measures to prevent the spread of Avian Influenza (more commonly known as ‘bird flu’) into the EU, personal imports of raw eggs for human consumption from China (not including Hong Kong or Macao), Malaysia or South Korea (the Republic of Korea) are banned. The ban does not apply to eggs that have been cooked or processed in some way which are still permitted as part of the 2kg concession. For certain protected species, additional restrictions may apply eg: caviar of sturgeon species: 125 grams per person If you wish to send by post, regardless of the amount, or bring in more than 125 grams in your personal luggage you must have the correct CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species) permits, or all of the product will be seized. Please contact the UK CITES Management Authority on 0117 372 8774, including if you need confirmation as to whether the caviar in question is listed as an endangered species The total weight of the caviar is included as part of the 20kg total weight per person allowance covering products from the ‘Fish/fishery products/bivalves (dead)’ category. From Faeroe Islands, Greenland and Iceland You may only bring in or send by post personal imports of the following products: Meat and dairy products (other than powdered infant milk, infant food, special foods and special pet feed required for medical reasons) 10 kg per person Powdered infant milk, infant food, special foods and special pet feed required for medical reasons* 10kg per person Special pet feed required for medical reasons* 10kg per person *provided that in both cases: the product does not require refrigeration before consumption the product is in commercially branded packaging the packaging is unbroken unless in current use For certain protected species, additional restrictions may apply eg: caviar of sturgeon species: 125 grams per person If you wish to send by post, regardless of the amount, or bring in more than 125 grams in your personal luggage you must have the correct CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species) permits, or all of the product will be seized. Please contact the UK CITES Management Authority on 0117 372 8774, including if you need confirmation as to whether the caviar in question is listed as an endangered species [Note that from Croatia and Greenland, the total weight of the caviar (from certain protected species) is included as part of the 20kg total weight per person allowance within fish/fishery products (including caviar not from certain protected species eg salmon caviar) - see below.] Greenland: additional restrictions Fish/fishery products/bivalves (dead) 20 kg total weight per person travelling or the weight of one fish, whichever weight is the highest Fresh fish must be gutted. Fishery products include: processed fish (dried, cooked, cured or smoked) lobsters and prawns caviar not from certain protected species eg salmon caviar Bivalves (dead) include: mussels oysters Other animal products 10 kg total weight per person travelling Other animal products include: bivalves (live) eg mussels and oysters eggs/egg products frogs’ legs (hind part of the frog with the skin/internal organs removed) honey reptile and insect meat snail meat (edible land snails, shelled) Frogs’ legs must be the back (ie the hind) part of the frog with the skin/internal organs removed. If the skin/internal organs are still attached, the frogs’ legs are not permitted. May be fresh, chilled, frozen or processed. Snails must be shelled, cooked and prepared/preserved meat of edible land snails, including canned snailmeat, and snail shells re-filled with snail meat. Live snails, dead snails still in their shells and water snails are not permitted. Restrictions on animal skins and bushmeat Animal hides and skins (either with or without hairs/fur) must be tanned or they are illegal products. Tanning means the hardening of hides and skins using vegetable tanning agents, chromium salts or other substances such as aluminium salts, ferric salts, silicic salts, aldehydes and quinones or other synthetic hardening agents. There is no specific limit on the amount you can bring. International trade in bushmeat derived from animals is either banned completely or controlled by means of a permitting system. Personal imports of all meat from non-EU countries are prohibited. Penalties for illegal importation are high with up to 7 years imprisonment and/or an unlimited fine. There is no precise definition of bushmeat that is universally accepted, although it is generally understood to be the meat of any wild animal hunted for food. It is not necessarily from endangered species. Checks, seizures, penalties and appeals Carrying banned animal products is illegal, and there are heavy penalties for smuggling. If you fail to declare any products that are not permitted, you could face severe delays or and you will be liable to action for a criminal offence including prosecution. The EU operates a system of strict controls on legal imports of animal products including meat. All products from non-EU countries can only be imported through designated BIPs, where they undergo veterinary checks by an official veterinary surgeon to make sure import conditions are met. All consignments are subject to documentary and identity checks at the BIP, and to prescribed levels of physical checks according to the type of product and country of origin. Imports are only permitted from those non-EU countries and product plants that have been authorised by the EU for the importation of the product in question. Such authorisation is based on guarantees to the EU about hygiene standards. The United Kingdom Border Agency ( UKBA ) is responsible for detecting smuggled goods from non-EU countries at Great Britain points of entry (except in areas designated as Border Inspection Posts (BIPs)). This includes postal imports whether at postal depots, ports or airports. They are also responsible for enforcing controls under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora ( CITES ). Department of Agriculture and Rural Development for Northern Ireland (DARDNI) has responsibility in Northern Ireland, both at BIPs and other points of entry. Seizures It is important you declare any products you are bringing in from outside the EU. If you are unsure about any of the products you are bringing in, speak to a UKBA Officer in the red channel or on the red point phone. If you declare any illegal products to UKBA , they will take them away and destroy them and no further action will be taken. If 3 friends arrived at customs together and one of them has 60kg of smoked salmon this would be permitted, even though the total amount was carried by one person. However the 3 people must all be present (one cannot be on a separate flight or a different train or ship). The concession will be determined on the gross weight including the packaging, eg fish packed with ice - if the gross weight of the fish and the ice together exceeds the concession, the whole amount will be seized. If the gross weight including the box exceeds the concession, the whole amount will be seized. United Kingdom Border Agency ( UKBA ) will take a pragmatic approach to seizing other items mixed or packed with animal products. However, if clothing or the bag appear to be contaminated ie there is blood on these items, then they will be seized and destroyed. For instance, if meat has been packed with fish of less than 20kg, cross-contamination will mean the fish will also be seized. The rules apply to any products sent either to a private, named individual by post, courier service or private carrier (including those ordered online) and even if they are for yourself, bought in a shop (including at an airport), home-grown/made or vacuum packed. Checks on mail arriving at international sorting offices are carried out by UKBA Officers looking for all contraband products. Illegal products will be seized and destroyed and you will be issued with a seizure notice by post. If you are concerned the products in the parcel may have been illegally sent to this country or if the products do not appear to be healthy you should notify your local Environmental Health Office. They should send an officer to seize and destroy the parcel. Appeals UKBA has an appeal procedure detailed in their Notice 12a. If UKBA is found to have wrongly seized the products then compensation for their loss is likely to be paid. The original products will have been destroyed as all perishable items are classed for immediate disposal. Exempted food products The following products are exempted from the rules: bread (but not sandwiches filled with meat or dairy products) cakes (but not if they contain fresh cream*), biscuits chocolate and confectionery (but not if the sweets are made with high levels of unprocessed dairy ingredients)* unfilled gelatine capsules food supplements packaged for the final consumer containing small amounts of an animal product (such as fish oil capsules) and those including glucosamine, chondroitin or chitosan meat extracts in liquid or spreadable form (but not pate or meat concentrates eg stock cubes, gravy granules or flavouring sachets or any that contain pieces of meat) olives stuffed with fish pasta and noodles, if processed or cooked (but not if mixed or filled with meat or meat products) soup, stocks and flavourings packaged for the final consumer containing meat extracts, meat concentrates, animal fats or fish oils, powders or extracts (but not if pieces of meat/fish eg when dissolved in water) any other food product not containing any fresh or processed meat or dairy and with less than 50% of processed egg or fishery products *Confectionery, chocolate or cakes (including Christmas cake, Simnel cake or cakes containing nuts) are permitted from any country as long as they are for your personal consumption and do not contain fresh cream or high levels of dairy products. Confectionery that contain high levels of dairy products include Burfi, Gulab Jaman, Halwah or Halva, Ras Malai, RasGullah, Ladoos, and Chum Chum.

/guidance/disease-control-in-flowers-and-shrubs,"How to recognise common pests and diseases in ornamentals, how to prevent them, quarantine measures, disease notification and effective treatments. Disease control in flowers and shrubs Crops and horticulture  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Introduction There are many pests and diseases that could cause serious damage to crops and plants in England if allowed to become established. Therefore there are stringent measures that ensure pests and diseases cannot be brought into the country and, if they are, how they must be dealt with. It is important that you can recognise early signs of ornamental pests and diseases in your plants in order to deal with the problem and - if necessary - inform your local plant health and seeds inspector. This guide explains the symptoms, problems and methods of control for various diseases that affect ornamentals, including P ramorum and P kernoviae. It also covers pests that affect ornamentals, such as nematodes, and the licences and regulations you must follow when importing cut flowers. Statutory action for sudden oak death P ramorum and P kernoviae Phytophthora ramorum (P ramorum) is an exotic fungus-like plant pathogen which causes damage to trees, shrubs and other plants. It is also known as ‘sudden oak death’. In the UK it has been found mainly on container-grown rhododendron, viburnum and camellia plants in nurseries. It has also been found on various types of: heathers witch-hazel laurel honeysuckle lilac yew Californian bay laurel oak species other trees - ash, European beech, horse chestnut, sweet chestnut, sycamore and Winter’s bark Symptoms Symptoms of P ramorum vary depending on the plant affected. Signs of infection for: rhododendron include blight of shoots, twigs and leaves viburnum include stem base infection or brown to black leaf infection pieris include brown stem lesions leading to aerial dieback, similar to Rhododendron yew include needle blight of young foliage leading to aerial dieback trees include blackening of bark, leaves, or shoots. Bark infections appear as large cankers with discoloured outer bark that seeps red sap. When the outer bark is removed, inner bark has dead inner-bark tissue The disease spreads through asexual spores produced on leaves of susceptible hosts. These can survive in plant debris for two winters and are dispersed by: rain splash wind driven rain irrigation ground water Disease control Since the first confirmations, there has been a co-ordinated approach to controlling the disease, which aims to: contain the disease eradicate the disease gather evidence to create future policy Action is only taken when the disease is confirmed and usually includes the: destruction of affected plants tracing of related stocks on horticultural plants moving in trade increased monitoring of imported host plants P ramorum is a notifiable pest and statutory action is being taken to prevent its introduction and spread. If you believe the pest may be on your premises, you should immediately contact the Fera (Food and Environment Research Agency) Plant Health and Seed Inspectors Division on 01904 465 625 or email them at planthealth.info@defra.gsi.gov.uk . Phytophthora kernoviae (P kernoviae) P kernoviae is a fungal disease that causes similar damage and has similar symptoms to P ramorum. Symptoms P kernoviae produces similar symptoms to P ramorum and has been found present in the same hosts, though most findings have been on rhododendron. The main symptoms are: leaf blackening leading to necrotic lesions cankers on tree barks bleeding lesions on tree trunk - often dark blue to black The infection can spread from leaf to leaf or plant to plant through: water splash airborne mist droplets movement of contaminated plant material Disease control As P kernoviae is a recently described species, it has only been observed in a limited number of sites. Currently, it is being treated as part of the P ramorum study. P kernoviae is a notifiable disease and statutory action is being taken to prevent its introduction and spread. If you believe the disease may be on your premises you should immediately contact the Fera Plant Health and Seed Inspectors Division on Telephone: 01904 465 625 or email them at planthealth.info@defra.gsi.gov.uk . Fireblight Fireblight is a serious disease caused by the bacterium Erwinia amylovora of apples, pears, Rosaceae trees and shrubs. Its hosts include: June berry flowering quince cotoneaster hawthorn quince loquat apple medlar firethorn pear mountain ash It is a quarantine disease, to prevent it moving - particularly into designated ‘protected zones’. However, it is now widespread throughout South and Central England due to its ability to move in planting material or aerially, eg along hawthorn hedges planted near railways, motorways and main roads. Symptoms Fireblight can affect all aerial parts of the host. Symptoms include: wilting and death of flower clusters after a blossom infection withering and death of young shoots - the tip of the shoot can bend to form a ‘shepherd’s crook’ shape leaves with necrotic patches, which spread from the leaf margin or the petiole and midrib, depending on the initial site of infection. These generally remain attached to the plant infected fruit turns brown or black and shrivels - however it usually stays attached to the plant cankering which may spread into the main stem and kill the plant by girdling. Externally, the cankers are usually sunken in appearance and surrounded by abnormal cracks in the bark. When the bark is removed, a reddish-brown discolouration of the underlying tissues may be revealed, often with a well-defined leading edge to the stained area It spreads through infected planting material which often does not show symptoms. Initial infection occurs through wounds in young shoots or blossom. The disease can then spread through the main stem and kill the plant. Disease control There are no chemical measures available to control fireblight. Nurseries selling host plants must register and be approved for issuing plant passports. If an infection is located, the Plant Health and Seeds Inspectorate ( PHSI ) has statutory powers to require removal of infected plants. Premises that are registered to issue passports for plants being traded into EU Protected Zones must meet additional requirements including buffer zone freedom. If infection is confirmed on or near registered premises, the PHSI has statutory powers to prevent its spread by removal of the affected plants. Fireblight is a notifiable disease and statutory action is being taken to prevent its introduction and spread. If you believe the disease may be on your premises you should immediately contact the Fera Plant Health and Seed Inspectors Division on 01904 465 625 or email them at planthealth.info@defra.gsi.gov.uk . Nematodes Nematodes are small, transparent, threadlike worms that are a common pest in the UK. Most nematode problems in ornamentals are caused by: Aphelenchoides ritzemabosi (A ritzemabosi) and Aphelenchoides fragariae - leaf and bud nematodes often found on nursery stock and herbaceous plants Ditylenchus dipsaci (D dipsaci) - stem or bulb eelworm often found on bulbs and herbaceous plants Meloidogyne spp - root-knot eelworm As well as damaging plants through feeding, nematodes can also transmit viruses. Nematode symptoms and damage A ritzemabosi attacks plant parts above the ground and can show a number of symptoms including: bushy plant appearance - first stems are dwarfed and the plant must grow extra basal stems distorted and deformed leaves - feeding in the buds causes growth retardation blackened or dead leaves infected side shoots infection of leaves leading to yellow spots and blotches - a later symptom water-soaked bands and blotches on ferns - leaves become dark brown or black and eventually die Symptoms or damage from D dipsaci include: discolouration or distortion of tissues - feeding of nematodes may kill affected plant tissues or the entire plant infested bulbs that are soft at the neck and show discoloured brown rings of dead tissue when cut through misshapen plant growth with distorted leaves or flowers Stem nematodes can be spread in bulbs, bulb fragments or leaf debris through: wind blown contamination cultivation movement of surface water presence in the soil Meloidogyne spp symptoms are often the presence of 2-centimetre long galls on roots, which can be an irregular shape. Nematodes attacks disrupt normal root function and plants will show nutrient deficiency, leading to wilting and death. Nematodes can only be confirmed by laboratory examination. Treatments There are several treatments you can consider to prevent nematode infestation. Biological control - ‘green manure’ crops can control nematodes if you use them to clean up land before planting. The most effective crops are members of the Brassica family which are effective when chopped and introduced into soil. Bio-insecticides - French marigold can be used to treat land between crops of field-grown trees and herbaceous plants. The variety ‘Ground Control’ is used in Dutch lily production and a kill rate of up to 95% has been claimed. Plant on land without crops or weeds to ensure marigold roots are the only nematode food source. A biocide marigolds contain can kill the pests. Cultural control - good general weed control will prevent the establishment and spread of stem and bud eelworms. You should consider using hot water treatment to kill any infestations in herbaceous perennials. You should only expose plants to hot water at 44.4°C for 15 minutes to avoid damaging plant tissues. Bulb treatment requires a longer period of time. You can also reduce the risk of flower damage by storing bulbs at 30°C for three weeks before treatment. Leaf and bud nematodes can be transferred in cuttings and spread on propagation tools, dead and dying plant material and poorly composted material. You can avoid excessive moisture in propagation and space plants to avoid leaf contact. You should use disinfectants to routinely clean tools, equipment and surfaces. Prevention You can follow similar prevention guidelines for all nematode species. You should ensure that: narcissus bulbs are sourced from a certified crop wherever possible and must be accompanied by a plant passport which confirms bulbs are free from stem nematodes. There is currently no certification scheme for tulips but they must have a plant passport. All passport plant stocks are inspected in the growing season by the Defra Plant Health and Seeds Inspectorate crops susceptible to attack by stem nematode should only be grown in the same field every four years. Groundkeeper bulbs should be destroyed machinery used during bulb production is regularly cleaned and disinfected. Bulb waste from grading should not be returned to agricultural land growing crops are regularly inspected for signs of stem nematode damage. Suspect bulbs and the bulbs next to them should be destroyed (destroy bulbs within a 1 metre radius - nematodes can move up to 1 metre in a season) all narcissus stocks are hot-water treated infected plants and fallen leaves are carefully removed from the garden or greenhouse and burned. Soil in affected nursery plantings should be fumigated Pest and disease threat when importing ornamentals and cut flowers You must follow certain plant health controls when importing cut flowers into the UK to prevent the introduction of plant pests and diseases. For plant health purposes the three categories plant materials fall into are: prohibited - poses such a serious risk that import is only permitted under authority of a licence issued by the Fera or the Forestry Commission controlled - this includes cuttings, rooted plants and trees that are not prohibited, as well as bulbs, most fruits, certain seeds and some cut flowers. You usually need a phytosanitary certificate from the plant protection service of the exporting country unrestricted - presents little or no risk and is not subject to routine plant health controls. Includes nearly all flower seeds, some cut flowers and fruit, and most vegetables for consumption or processing - except potatoes Licences You can sometimes import prohibited or controlled plants under licence from Fera . You must make this application before you import and you may have to pay a fee. Fera can issue licences for the import, movement and keeping of: plants and plant material for scientific or trialling purposes soil and growing medium for physical or chemical analysis other plant material which would otherwise be prohibited entry Imports of certain forest trees, wood, bark and some wood products are subject to legislation implemented by the Forestry Commission. How to apply To apply for an import licence, you must complete the relevant application form and return it to the following address: The Cashier Shared Services Directorate Defra PO Box 347 York YO1 2YX You can find plant licence application forms on the Fera website . The costs you will incur when you apply for a licence are for: licences to import, move and keep prohibited soil or growing medium for physical or chemical analysis - £220 renewal of the authority - £12 renewal of the authority with changes to scientific or technical assessment - £100 inspection of licensed premises to monitor compliance - £27 per hour You need to enclose a copy of standard operating procedures for the work you are undertaking and can only get a licence issued in the name of an individual who is a permanent member of staff. You should submit your application as soon as possible, at least one month before the licence is needed. Licences are valid for 12 months and must be renewed before they expire. Plant passports You may need a plant passport to move plants, seeds and plant products within the EU . You can find information on plant passports on the Fera website . Quarantine pests Quarantine measures are taken to keep foreign pests out of areas where they could cause damage to crops, trees and wild plants. Measures are based on a scientific assessment of the risks. Certification ensures that high quality planting material, substantially free from plant pests and diseases, is available to growers. ‘Pests’ are organisms that affect the health of plants by feeding on them or causing disease. They can be: insects other invertebrates bacteria fungi viruses other pathogens Whether an organism is a potential quarantined pest is judged by a pest risk assessment ( PRA ). PRAs A PRA uses biological, scientific and economic evidence to determine whether a pest should be regulated, and what measures should be taken against it. PRAs follow an international standard and consider evidence such as: simple expert judgements - for example, what it feeds on, what its hosts are assessments of biological factors climate maps estimated costs and benefits of the measures needed to keep a pest out of an area costs and measures for eradicating an outbreak They are written by plant health experts to inform public policy decision makers of the issues. There can be a number of conclusions following a PRA , including that: specific treatments can be recommended, such as control measures exclusion or eradication is not warranted for low risk organisms Find quarantine identification cards on the Fera website . The Food and Environment Research Agency diagnostic tool There are many forms of pests and diseases that affect ornamentals in the UK and have an economic impact on your business. They can vary in severity depending on the plant affected, so it is important that you recognise symptoms of diseases early to treat the problem and prevent it from spreading. Find plant health risk management information on the Fera website . You can submit a sample to Fera ’s Plant Clinic, who will then help you to diagnose any plant problems quickly.

/government/publications/chalara-management-plan,"Ash tree dieback is caused by the Chalara fraxinea fungus. Chalara management plan  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Ash tree dieback is caused by the Chalara fraxinea fungus. It has already affected a high proportion of ash trees in Northern Europe. It was discovered for the first time in Great Britain in a nursery in Buckinghamshire in February 2012. In October 2012, it was also found in the wider environment in woodland in Norfolk. The scientific advice is that we can’t stop Chalara but we can focus on reducing the rate of its spread. However, this plan ; provides an update on the action Government and others have already taken in response to the disease; Sets out new science-based and proportionate action that will be taken now that our understanding of Chalara, and the costs and benefits of action has developed further; and, Outlines further work that will be undertaken to further develop our understanding of the disease. This plan is an update to the interim control plan that was published on the 6 December 2012. The Management Plan sets out action around four key objectives: Reducing the rate of spread of the disease Developing resistance to the disease in the native ash tree population Encouraging  landowner, citizen and industry engagement in surveillance, monitoring and action in tackling the problem Building economic and environmental resilience in woodlands and in associated industries The actions announced in the Plan includes research into resistance to Chalara, outlines funding to assist landowners with replanting of diseased newly infected young ash trees, details how we are working with  engaging with citizens, landowners and industry on surveillance, monitoring and action in tackling Chalara, and details on build economic and environmental resilience in woodlands and in associated industries. In Spring 2013 the independent Tree Health and Plant Biosecurity Expert Taskforce convened by Defra’s Chief Scientific Adviser, Professor Ian Boyd will be publishing the Final Report of the Independent Tree Health and Plant Biosecurity Expert Taskforce that will look at ways to prevent pests and diseases from entering the country in the future.  Below are links further details on research that is being commissioned and other evidence sought as we continue to improve our understanding of Chalara , how it spreads, and how spread might be slowed and damage reduced.   This research forms part of the overarching tree health and plant biosecurity evidence plan. Also published today a project by the Forest Research (the research agency of the Forestry Commission in conjunction with many collaborating land-owners and nurseries to identify those few ash trees which might be resistant to Ash Die Back.

The plan must explain how improvements made by the local authority to the public rights of way network in your area will provide a better experience for these users: walkers cyclists horse riders horse and carriage drivers people with mobility problems people using motorised vehicles, eg motorbikes Consult Before preparing your plans and making assessments you must consult interested parties in the area your rights of way improvement plan will cover, including: highway authorities whose areas adjoin your area district councils and parish councils the National Park Authority the Broads Authority Natural England local access forums You should carry out studies and surveys to find out whether local rights of way meet the needs of the public. Consult specific user groups as well as finding out the public’s general expectations of local rights of way. You should also consult with owners and managers of land with public rights of way. Consider how the land is used for agriculture, forestry and nature conservation to avoid conflict and encourage co-operation in improving public rights of way. Make an assessment You must carry out an assessment of the local rights of way. Your assessment will form part of the rights of way improvement plan. You must make a new assessment if you’re reviewing an existing plan. Before making the assessment you must consider: the definitive map and statement of rights of way (a map showing all local public rights of way and a statement which details all changes to the network) and any applications for changes to them the current condition of the network any improvement requests for the network You must then make an assessment of: to what extent routes are available to different groups of users, eg cyclists, walkers, horse riders routes that are not suitable for all or some users, eg users with mobility problems inconsistencies on individual rights of way, eg paths that don’t follow the mapped route or routes which have a dead end opportunities to improve the network, eg restoring routes that have been cut off by building works You’ll need to work closely with other local authorities while the plans are prepared, particularly where rights of way in your area are used mainly by another authority’s residents. Make the plan You should base your plan on the needs of local people and visitors to the area. Consider: access to the countryside or a particular viewpoint, feature or attraction routes to support tourism, regeneration or community projects alternative routes for cyclists, horse riders and walkers to avoid using busy roads circular routes for leisure use, eg walking, running, cycling paths and routes by water or the sea which need repairing crossings over roads, railways, rivers and canals existing rights of way, eg those that end in cul-de-sacs or that have different rights along their length routes for local journeys, eg walking to work, the shops, railway stations routes to help people travel through or around heavily developed areas Your proposals for improving rights of way shouldn’t benefit one type of user at the expense of another, eg improvements intended to benefit cyclists that restrict motorists. Prepare a statement of action As part of the rights of way improvement plan you must prepare a statement of action which says how you plan to manage local rights of way for each type of user - this should be based on your assessment. For each item in the statement of action you’ll need to include the: proposed action costs organisations that will be involved time it will take to complete Publish the draft plan Local authorities must publish a draft rights of way improvement plan in at least 2 local newspapers, with details of how the public can get a copy and make comments on it. You must make sure a copy is available to view for free at the local authority offices. You must also supply a copy to anyone who requests it, for free or for a charge. The draft plan must clearly state where comments should be sent and by when (you should allow a minimum of 12 weeks for comments to be received). You must read all comments and acknowledge that you’ve received them. Publish the final plan Make any changes that are required to the draft plan and then once it’s been agreed, publish the final plan, eg on the local authority website. You’ll also need to notify anyone who contributed to the plan that it’s been published. You must make a copy available to view for free at the local authority offices. You must also supply a copy to anyone who requests it, for free or for a charge. Publish a reviewed plan After making a new assessment you must review your existing plan and decide whether to amend it. If you decide to amend the plan you must publish the new version. If you decide not to amend it you must re-publish the existing plan and a report explaining the reasons that it hasn’t changed.

/guidance/apply-to-add-a-wine-name-to-the-eu-protected-wine-register,"How to apply to add the name of your wine to the EU protected wine register. Apply to add a wine name to the EU protected wine register  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs If you’re a wine producer, you can apply to the EU to have the name of your wine added to its protected wine register. If your wine is added to the protected register, other producers can’t use the same name for their wine unless they both: produce it in the area the EU has agreed with you make it using the same methods the EU has agreed with you You’ll also be allowed to put an EU symbol or wording on your wine that says it’s on the EU protected register. See a list of protected wine names from the UK . You can also apply to add a food or drink product to the EU protected register . Who can apply You can apply as an individual wine producer or as a group of producers who all produce the wine you want to protect. If you apply as an individual, your application must show that you’re the only producer of the wine you want to protect in the area you associate it with. Protection marks you can apply for There are 2 different types of protection mark that you can apply to the EU for: protected designation of origin ( PDO ) protected geographical indication ( PGI ) Protected designation of origin To get the PDO mark, you’ll need to prove to the EU that your wine has quality and characteristics that are a result of the environment it’s made in and the people who live there. You’ll also need to show: the grapes you use to make the wine come exclusively from the area you want to associate it with and that you make the wine in that area you make the wine using vine varieties that come from the genus vitis vinifera Protected geographical indication To get the PGI mark, you’ll need to show: the wine you want to protect has a specific quality, reputation or other characteristics that are a result of the area you’re associating it with you produce the wine in this area at least 85% of the grapes that you use to make the wine come from this area the grapes you use to make the wine come from vine varieties belonging to vitis vinifera or a cross between the vitis vinifera species and other species of the genus vitis Make an application Provide applicant details You must include: the names of everyone who is part of your application and their positions (eg owner of Vineyard X) a postal address, email address and phone number for you or your application group Protection you’re applying for You must state whether you’re applying for a PDO or PGI protection mark. Name you want to protect Include the name of the wine you or your group wants to add to the register Use a name that nobody else is already using, and that nobody else has trademarked. Make a draft product specification As well as your application, you must describe your wine using a product specification. Describe the wine You must state the category of wine, eg white, red or rosé, and whether it’s still or sparkling. You should describe the following analytical characteristics: total and actual alcoholic strength of the wine total sugars, expressed in terms of fructose and glucose (including any sucrose in semi-sparkling and sparkling wines) total acidity volatile acidity total sulphur dioxide carbon dioxide level, in the case of semi-sparkling and sparkling wines any other characteristic properties that are part of your product specification If you’re applying for a PGI you should also describe the wine’s colour and taste. If you’re applying for a PDO you should be more detailed and describe the: appearance, taste and smell mouthfeel colour Avoid subjective terms - use the language of wine experts, chemists or agronomists. Wine grape variety Your product specification must include the wine grape varieties that the wine must be made from, by anyone wishing to use the protected name. Describe oenological practices You should describe: the techniques that must be used to make wine with the name you’re applying to have protected the cultural practices that must be used, eg vine training systems or how the grapes are harvested any other rules you want to create for how people must make the wine if they want to give it the name you’re applying to protect Maximum yields State the volume of grapes that can be picked per year to make the wine in both: kilograms of grapes per hectare hectolitres of the final product per hectare Define the area You need to define the area you want to associate with your wine by citing: physical boundaries, eg rivers and roads administrative boundaries, eg provinces and cities geographical, environmental or geological characteristics human intervention in the process, eg distance from vineyard to the press, expertise, wine-making or bottle-making facilities maps - you can include these in your application or link to them online If vineyards are on the boundary of an administrative area like a county, you should provide a detailed map showing the extent of the area. Usually wine-makers will apply to associate their wine with one entire area, but you can pick several growing zones within a wider common area or region. Describe the area for PDO When you’re describing the geographical area, you should only cite features that have an influence on the individual characteristics of your wine. If you’re applying for the PDO mark, you should describe both the human and natural factors of the area and explain how these distinguish your wine. Human factors are practices that you control or have established, for example: the wine grape variety(ies) allowed in the PDO / PGI area the maximum yields the specific oenological practices which are allowed or compulsory the relevant restrictions on making the wines the cultural practices which are allowed or compulsory the artisan knowledge of local producers - these must be skills specific to the area Natural factors are the characteristics of the defined geographical area relevant to the link, for example: pedo-climatic features topography climate and rainfall exposure altitude Use precise measurements when citing climate, for example give average rainfall in millimetres. Describe the area for PGI For PGI wines, you should describe the natural and human factors of the area. Link your product to the area You need to explain the factors that link your product to the area you want to associate it with, for example: how natural and human factors in the area provide its distinctive character why your wine can’t be made outside of the area If you’re applying to protect different types of wine products, you need to explain the link to the area for each one. Depending on the production or ageing method, the grape varieties, or the quality, colour, type of place, or a particular event linked to the history of the product, you might have to provide more than one description in this section. For example, you might make one section for each traditional term related to the PDO or PGI you’re applying for. Distinguishing your product You need to explain what makes your PDO or PGI wine different from wines that use the same grape or grapes in other geographical areas. You need to show that there are factors unique to the area that influence how you make the wine and distinguish it from other wines using the same grape or grapes in other areas. Distinguishing your product for PDO If you’re applying for PDO status, you need to list the analytical or organoleptic elements which are unique to the geographical area where you make the wine. Each element you list needs to be linked to the geographical environment. Your application will be judged on the combination of these elements. Distinguishing your product for PGI If you’re applying for PGI status, you must either: show that the analytical or organoleptic elements are unique to the geographical area where you make the wine explain how the wine’s reputation is connected to the area you make it in You can explain how the wine’s reputation is connected to the area you make it in by stating, for example: market share the length of time that people have marketed wine under the name you’re proposing to protect where you sell it the level of investment made in using and promoting the proposed PGI name Interaction Describe why your wine can only be made in the area you’re linking it with. Explain how the climate, the human factors, geology, grapevines and wine-making practices make your wine distinct from a wine produced in a nearby area. You should provide more detail on this if you’re applying for a PDO . Laboratory contact details You need to give contact details for a laboratory that will test your product to make sure it meets your specification. The laboratory you nominate must be European Standard EN45011 accredited. All PDO and PGI wines will be tested annually - you won’t be able to put them on sale with the protection mark until they’ve passed the test. Send your application and specification To apply, email your application to philip.munday@defra.gsi.gov.uk You can also post it to: Phil Munday Wine Team Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs ( Defra ) Area 1B Nobel House 17 Smith Square London SW1P 3JR After you apply Assessment Defra will examine your application and product specification and they’ll contact you or arrange meetings with you if they need more detail. Your application can be rejected at this stage if it doesn’t meet key criteria, eg if you’re trying to protect a wine name that’s already protected or a widely used wine name. National consultation After Defra decides that your application is completed to its full potential, they’ll open it to national consultation. They’ll send details of your application to a list of interested bodies, eg the UK Vineyards Association (UKVA) and the Wine and Spirit Trades Association (WSTA) These bodies can object to your application or comment on it. You’ll have to address any queries or objections with the person or body that raised them - your application can’t go ahead until Defra agrees that these are resolved. Submitting to the European Commission After you’ve resolved any objections or comments, Defra will make a single document that sums up your application and send it to the European Commission. The commission will examine the single document and make comments or ask for more information if they need it. If they’re satisfied that your application can go ahead, they’ll publish the single document in the EU official journal. People in other member states or non-EU countries have 2 months to lodge objections, after the document is published. If your application is successful If the EU Commission receives no objections, or after they’ve been resolved, your product will be added to the EU’s electronic register of protected wine names."

The government is bringing forward more than £140 million of the £2.3 billion six-year flood defence programme announced in December to better protect more than 31,000 homes and businesses from flooding sooner than planned. 47 brand new schemes have been given the green light as part of the long-term investment programme and work will start on another 165 flood defence projects earlier than previously announced. The 6 year programme represents a real terms increase in expenditure and will reduce flood risk across the country by 5%. 230,000 homes have been better protected from the risk of flooding and coastal erosion so far this Parliament. Environment Agency Chairman Sir Philip Dilley said: “This programme of more than 1,500 flood risk management schemes will significantly reduce flood risk to more than 300,000 properties in England by 2021, benefiting people, the economy and the environment. Government funding has also been brought forward meaning that over 30,000 properties will benefit from reduced flood risk earlier than originally planned. “Our priority is to do as much as we can with every pound of funding from government and local partners, but of course the risk of flooding can never be entirely eliminated. With one in six homes in England at risk of flooding, I encourage people to check their flood risk and sign up to the Environment Agency’s free flood warning service.” Notes to Editors Please visit here for further information on the schemes.

The scheme will reduce flood risk to over 14,000 homes and businesses and reduce flooding of local roads, tramway network, a major sewage pumping station and public utilities. The new sea defences will also provide an improved promenade and recreational areas. The scheme will cost around £100 million. The Environment Agency is planning to complete works in Anchorsholme by 2016 and in Rossall by 2018."

/government/news/uk-leads-global-crackdown-on-illegal-wildlife-trade,"Britain will provide new funding to a global crackdown on the trade in rhino horn, elephant ivory and other illegal wildlife products. UK leads global crackdown on illegal wildlife trade  Department for International Development Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Britain will provide new funding to a global crackdown on the trade in rhino horn, elephant ivory and other illegal wildlife products, International Development Secretary Justine Greening announced today. As well as strengthening law enforcement and reducing demand for illegal products, the £3 million of new support will focus on helping communities affected by the illegal wildlife trade boost their incomes through wildlife conservation. Justine Greening said: Poaching threatens endangered animals such as the white rhino, African elephant and snow leopard. It also feeds corruption, undermines global security and costs governments billions in lost revenues every year. We cannot and will not look the other way while this continues. This new funding will improve law enforcement, reduce demand for illegal wildlife products and, importantly, help communities find new sources of income and free themselves from this horrific trade. Speaking from the Illegal Wildlife Trade Conference in Botswana, DEFRA Minister Lord De Mauley said: Wildlife crime has reached unprecedented levels. We must not stand idly by. We must honour the commitments made in London and build on them at Kasane. This issue affects many of our important international partners deeply; and is much more than an environmental issue; it is about tackling corruption, improving security and raising livelihoods. If we wait any longer then we will wake up to find that all the endangered species living in the wild have been killed. We must send a powerful message to poachers and traffickers wherever they operate: the illegal wildlife trade ends here. The additional £3 million for the Illegal Wildlife Trade (IWT) challenge fund, financed by the Department for International Development (DFID) and managed by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), builds on the £10 million fund announced ahead of the London Conference on the Illegal Wildlife Trade, held in February last year. The first round of Britain’s challenge fund is now supporting 19 projects around the world. Projects supported in the first call for funding include: Sending experts to border points in the Horn Of Africa to provide training on wildlife law Funding Interpol to improve cooperation between national agencies in Uganda, Kenya and South Africa Increasing the number of successful convictions across Africa with a new wildlife forensic network, linking DNA laboratories across the region. The illegal wildlife trade is booming. Rhino horn is now worth more than gold and is more valuable on the black market than diamonds or cocaine. The ivory trade has more than doubled since 2007. UNEP estimate that the trade costs between $7 and $23 billion every year in lost revenues, primarily for governments in the developing world. But since last year’s London Conference there has been solid progress. Over the past 12 months ivory stockpiles have been destroyed in countries from Hong Kong to Chad. There is now tightened security, more training and more arrests across the globe. The second call for proposals to the IWT fund will soon be open for applications. There will be £5 million available in this second round of the Illegal Wildlife Trade Challenge Fund, including £3 million of new funds plus £2 million in existing funding. Organisations can bid for funding for projects in developing countries that address the following themes: Developing sustainable livelihoods for communities affected by illegal wildlife trade Strengthening law enforcement and the role of the criminal justice system Reducing demand for the products of the illegal wildlife trade [Contact:5]"
/government/news/uk-stands-with-africa-in-renewed-global-boost-to-fight-illegal-wildlife-trade,"Defra Minister Lord de Mauley leads the UK delegation to the Second Illegal Wildlife Trade Conference in Botswana UK stands with Africa in renewed global boost to fight illegal wildlife trade  Foreign & Commonwealth Office Department for International Development Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Defra Minister Lord de Mauley today (25 March) led the UK delegation to the Second Illegal Wildlife Trade Conference in Kasane, Botswana. Following last year’s successful conference in London, this high-level meeting once again shone the international spotlight on wildlife crime. The poaching of elephant and rhinos poaching remains at crisis levels in Africa while it also affects a huge range of wildlife species around the world. 32 countries took part in the conference, signing up to the Kasane Statement which pledged new action combatting the illegal wildlife trade. This includes a commitment to change legislation relating to financial crimes associated with wildlife crime – including money laundering – to ensure tougher penalties. These countries also promised to take action on sustainable livelihoods, giving communities the opportunity to benefit from their local resources in a way that recognises their needs while also protecting the ecosystems around them. The Kasane Statement signatories also pledged to reduce demand through co-operation with the transport industry and private sector more broadly. Environment Minister Lord de Mauley said: The Kasane conference brings together leaders from across the world with one aim in mind: ending wildlife crime once and for all. I am proud of the role the UK is playing, first in holding the initial conference in London last year, and then in supporting initiatives that protect endangered species. With that in mind I am pleased that we are adding £3 million to our Challenge Fund, bring total funding up to £13 million over 4 years. I hope we see the same level of success with projects in this second round as we did in the first round in 2014. This is a fight we can win, but it is not going to be easy and it is not going to be instant. We are up against ruthless and professional poachers, who will stop at nothing to get their prize. But in coming together today we have shown our commitment to urgent change. None of us want to see the extinction of elephants, rhinos or any other species, and we are determined to maintain the pressure until the illegal wildlife trade is a thing of the past. With that in mind, I am delighted that Vietnam has offered to host a further conference in 2016, a strong signal that global action will continue. Before the conference, Development Secretary Justine Greening announced new funding for a second round of the successful IWT Challenge Fund, with an additional £3 million. With existing projects in Vietnam, Thailand, Malawi, Tanzania and Kyrgyzstan amongst others, the fund has already helped governments and NGOs train rangers, support local communities, educate consumers about the illegal trade, and tighten law enforcement to lead to more prosecutions. International Development Secretary Justine Greening said: Poaching threatens endangered animals such as the white rhino, African elephant and snow leopard. It also feeds corruption, undermines global security and costs governments billions in lost revenues every year. We cannot and will not look the other way while this continues. This new funding will improve law enforcement, reduce demand for illegal wildlife products and, importantly, help communities find new sources of income and free themselves from this horrific trade. This new funding complements work that has been taking place throughout the year, including the establishment of an international taskforce on the transportation industry, chaired by William Hague. The taskforce is looking at the role of all transport in taking illegally traded products from source to destination, with the aim of tightening controls to prevent them getting through to their intended customers.

/government/statistics/january-2013-farming-and-food-brief,"January 2013 news, economics and statistics relating to the UK’s farming and food industries. January 2013 farming and food brief  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs This monthly paper brings together the latest key information relating to agriculture and the wider economy. In particular it highlights the results of recently published economic and statistical evidence and research. Headlines this month include: Average Farm Business Income is expected to fall across most farm types (with the exception of poultry, where income is unchanged) in 2012/13 as the effect of the poor growing season and harvest is felt across both the cropping and livestock sectors. The falls forecast are substantial for dairy (42 per cent), lowland livestock (44 per cent), LFA livestock (52 per cent) and specialist pigs (50 per cent). Global values for maize, wheat and soya increased sharply in the early summer of 2012 in response to the US drought. Grain and oilseed markets in the UK followed suit and since harvest have remained firm. This has offset to some extent the impact of the poor weather on arable incomes which are expected to fall by around 11 per cent. The farmgate milk price has remained at a record high in December 2012 at 30.08 pence per litre; this is a 3 per cent rise on December 2011. Despite the usual seasonal increase, the provisional volume of wholesale milk delivered to dairies was 5.6 per cent down on last year, as poor grazing conditions and high feed prices continue to affect supplies. Milk production is at its lowest level for 9 years. The annual rate of food price inflation fell slightly to 3.8 per cent in December and is well above general CPI inflation which has remained at 2.7 per cent for three consecutive months."

/guidance/manage-your-land-on-the-england-coast-path,"As a land owner or manager of land with coastal access, find out about your responsibilities and how public access can be managed. England Coast Path: manage your land in the coastal margin Access and rights of way Natural England Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Overview The England Coast Path ( ECP ) is a new national trail being created by Natural England. For the first time people will have the right of access around all our open coast both along the England Coast Path and, usually, over the associated ‘coastal margin’. How your coastal land is affected Natural England must: aim to strike a “fair balance” between your property interests and the public’s rights to enjoy open-air recreation on coastal land Coastal access won’t: take the ownership of your land away from you - you can still manage your land as you see fit create new public rights through your private space around houses eg gardens interfere with any businesses you run on your coastal land unnecessarily Manage erosion If your land is affected by erosion or other coastal change, it will be possible to roll back the line of the trail. This means the route can move without Natural England having to go to the Secretary of State for approval, so that response to natural changes - such as erosion - is managed quickly. Manage signs Your local access authority will install signs to mark the route as necessary, and any new gates required for access through your land. This work is paid for by Natural England, who also help with the authority’s maintenance costs once the route is open. What people can do on your land People can normally access your land in the coastal margin on foot. They can: walk sightsee bird-watch climb run Visitors to your land can carry out any activities if they are: allowed by the law on footpaths, bridleways and other public rights of way you give them permission to do something on the list below allowed to do something where a right already exists Visitors using their rights must - at all times - keep dogs: under effective control on a short lead in the vicinity of livestock What people can’t do on your land The CROW Act has a list of ‘general restrictions’ that limit what people may do, unless you give them permission to do something on the list. They can’t: ride a horse or bicycle drive a vehicle (unless it is an invalid carriage) bring an animal, other than a dog camp play organised games hang-glide or paraglide use a metal detector run commercial activities on the land such as: trade or sell charge other visitors for things they do on your land film, photograph or make maps remove, damage, or destroy any plant, shrub, tree or root with intent light, cause or risk a fire damage hedges, fences, walls, crops or anything else on the land leave gates open, that are not propped or fastened open leave litter disturb livestock, wildlife or habitats with intent post any notices commit any criminal offence Land that doesn’t have public access Public access rights under the CROW Act don’t apply to your land if it’s considered ‘excepted land’. Excepted land may still appear on CROW Act maps . This is explained below. Types of excepted land without public access include the following: Land that is fully excepted: buildings or the curtilage of such land eg courtyards parks or gardens quarries and other active mineral workings (except, under certain circumstances, the removal of sand or shingle from an area of foreshore or beach) railways or tramways temporary livestock pens racecourses or aerodromes land which is being developed and which will become excepted land in future land covered by structures like electricity substations, wind turbines, telephone masts works, other than, flood defences or sea defences land under military byelaws, eg most Ministry of Defence training areas schools including playing fields land which forms part of a public highway Excepted land, with provision for an access strip normally 4 metres wide: land ploughed for the growing of crops or trees in the past year golf courses regulated caravan or camping sites burial grounds Excepted land is still out of bounds to the public even if it appears as open access land on CROW Act maps . Your liability to the public Your level of occupier liability is reduced when new coastal access rights are created along the ECP or within the coastal margin. You are not responsible for any damage or injury caused by any physical feature on the land, whether it is a natural feature of the landscape or a man-made one. Charges You can’t charge visitors for access but you can charge for goods, services and facilities, eg deck chair hire, parking and entry to attractions Development on your land You can develop your land subject to approval from your local planning authority. You should contact Natural England about your plans if your development may affect the ECP or a site of special scientific interest (SSSI). Natural England can submit a report to the Secretary of State recommending a change to the ECP if it’s affected by your development. If visitors are likely to disrupt your work or be put in danger by it, you can put up warning signs. If necessary Natural England can help you restrict or exclude access . Open your land for public access If you own land, or hold a lease which has more than 90 years left to run, you can voluntarily create public access rights by dedicating the land under section 16 of the CROW Act . This dedication is permanent (or, where appropriate, lasts for the duration of the long lease), so the rights will continue to apply when you no longer own the land. You can use a dedication to: provide a legal public right of access to land (eg woodland) that would not otherwise be covered by the CROW Act make sure that public access remains available even if the land ceases to be open access land allow public access to areas in the ECP coastal margin that are usually excepted land You can also allow additional recreational activities to take place on your open access land by relaxing or removing one or more of the general restrictions , eg to allow people to ride horses. This can be done either through a permanent dedication, or by agreeing to a ‘direction’ that makes this change indefinitely or for a specified period of time. Contact the Open Access Contact Centre for further advice on dedicating land or relaxing or removing general restrictions. Restrict public access The route of the ECP is designed to be sensitive to land use, it can: pass along the seaward edge of fields pass along existing paths and tracks (where available) avoid unsuitable areas of your land, eg sites used for heavy industry You can use either informal measures, such as signing, or legal restrictions, to manage public access and avoid conflict with your land management activities. You can mark the boundaries of open access land with the access symbol. The ECP will be signed with the national trails ‘acorn symbol’. See the Countryside Code for more information on these symbols. Any need for formal restrictions or exclusions of public access will be discussed with you when the route and coastal margin are being planned. If circumstances change later and you think visitors may disrupt your work or be endangered by it, you can speak to Natural England about how to manage your operations which may include formal restrictions or exclusions if necessary. See Open access land and the coastal margin: how to restrict public access for more information. Contacts Open Access Contact Centre Telephone: 0300 060 2091 Email: openaccess@naturalengland.org.uk"

/government/news/bradford-shopkeeper-fined-for-selling-rotten-fruit-and-vegetables,"Sentence follows an investigation by the Horticultural Marketing Inspectorate  Bradford shopkeeper fined for selling rotten fruit and vegetables  Rural Payments Agency Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs A Bradford shopkeeper has been fined for selling rotten fruit and vegetables following an investigation by the Horticultural Marketing Inspectorate (HMI). Sheikh Abdul Waheed, aged 63, owner of Fruit World, in Oastler Shopping Centre, was sentenced at Bradford Magistrates’ Court on Friday (15 May). He had previously admitted eight breaches of EU marketing standards for fresh horticultural produce, when he appeared at Leeds’ Magistrates’ Court on 21 April. The offences were found during an HMI inspection on 27 August last year and related to the display and offer for sale of apples (four counts) which were rotting and badly bruised rotting cucumbers, peaches and sweet peppers and overripe plums. Mr Waheed was fined £2,400 (£300 per offence) and ordered to pay £85 prosecution costs. HMI is part of the Rural Payments Agency and Operations Director Paul Caldwell said: “This case is another example of the work the Horticultural Marketing Inspectorate undertakes to protect consumers. “Fresh produce should be good quality and the HMI’s work is important in ensuring these standards are met. “Prosecution is a last resort and we always try to gain compliance with quality regulations through advice, guidance and instruction. “In this particular case, the prosecution followed a series of visits to the shop over eight months. Between October 2013 and May 2014, the store received six visits from inspectors where advice and guidance on compliance was offered. However, poor quality produce was found on five occasions and inadequate labelling on every visit. “The Magistrates in this case stated they were appalled at the state of the produce which had been on sale.” Background Fruit World is located at Units 13-18, Oastler Shopping Centre, Bradford BD1 3SR The HMI is part of the Rural Payments Agency (RPA). The Inspectorate is responsible for the enforcement of the EU marketing standards for fresh fruit, vegetables, salad crops, nuts and cultivated mushroom, throughout England and Wales, wherever fresh produce is grown, imported, exported, bought or sold. HMI operates a transparent risk-based approach to enforcement and has the principle aim of gaining cooperation and compliance from the trade it regulates at all stages of the distribution chain. Prosecutions are only taken as a last resort when all other options of education and advice have been exhausted."

/guidance/dairy-farming-and-schemes,"Information on hygiene standards and milking practices for UK dairy farmers, with a guide to EU schemes for dairy farmers and producers Dairy farming and schemes Dairy and milk production Rural Payments Agency Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Introduction Dairy farming is the single largest agricultural sector in the UK, accounting for around 17% of UK agricultural production by value. This guide explains relevant hygiene standards, milking practices and requirements for dairy farmers and producers. The guide also covers the milk marketing standards for the UK and Europe, together with the EU school milk scheme. Dairy schemes The Rural Payments Agency ( RPA ) runs various EU support schemes for producers of dairy products, such as butter, cheese and skimmed milk powder ( SMP ). These include private storage aid schemes for butter and the intervention butter price support mechanism. Private Storage Aid scheme The Private Storage Aid scheme allow excess production to be stored when prices are low - either permanently or until the market recovers. EU funding is based on storage costs, quality depreciation and possible price increases. Dairy producers can apply for aid under the Private Storage Aid scheme to store both salted and unsalted butter. You must register with the RPA and be VAT-registered before you can apply for aid under the Private Storage Aid scheme. Storage facilities must be located in the UK and can be inspected by RPA officials. Find information about the Private Storage Aid scheme on the RPA website . Intervention Butter Scheme The Intervention Butter Scheme supports butter producers and manufacturing creameries by buying excess butter and SMP when prices are low and selling them when they rise. As with storage aid schemes, purchasing can be temporary or permanent. The storage aid scheme involves resale within the EU , while under permanent purchasing, the stored butter is exported for sale outside the EU after the storage period. Once bought, the butter shall be stored in a cold storage facility nominated by the RPA and SMP is stored in an RPA -approved warehouse. However, only unsalted butter is eligible for the Intervention Butter Scheme, and there is a minimum quantity of 20 tonnes. The scheme operates between 1 March and 31 August, if prices fall below set levels. Find guidance on the Intervention Butter Scheme on the RPA website . You can also read about recent changes to the Intervention Butter Scheme on the RPA website. Milk Quotas Scheme The amount of milk produced in the UK is subject to a quota. The Milk Quotas Scheme is administered by the RPA . In years where the UK exceeds its total milk quota, producers exceeding their own quota are subject to a levy based on the volume of milk produced in excess of quota. There are two types of quota for milk - wholesale and direct sale. Wholesale quota covers whole milk which is sold in bulk by a producer to a first purchaser. Direct sales quota covers milk and milk products sold direct by the producer to consumers. All first purchasers of milk in the UK must be approved by the RPA . Both purchasers and direct sellers have to make an annual declaration to the  RPA detailing the amount of milk and/or milk products purchased or sold as appropriate. The rules relating to the Milk Quotas Scheme can be complex depending on your individual circumstances. If you are considering becoming a milk producer or changing an existing milk production business, you should contact the Milk Quotas Team on Telephone: 01392 365 700. Alternatively, you can find out about milk quotas on the RPA website. Cheese recovery The Food Standards Agency ( FSA ) publishes guidance on food hygiene procedures for cheese recovery, or the manufacturing and handling of cheese into new products for human consumption. Several categories of cheeses may be used as raw material: line recovery fines mis-shapes off-cuts downgrade and quality rejects returns cheese contaminated with visible mould not part of production process or final product Only EU -licensed establishments are allowed to carry out cheese recovery processes. If not suitable for human consumption, recovery cheese must be disposed of as an animal by-product. All recovery cheese packs should be clearly marked and bear the words “Cheese for further processing”. See the guide on dealing with animal by-products . Milking operations To produce safe raw milk, dairy farmers should maintain strict cleanliness, check milk and animals regularly and prevent contamination. As far as possible, you should follow basic principles of general cleanliness, as set out in EU regulations. These include: making sure teats, udders and adjacent parts are clean before cluster attachment using pre and post milking teat disinfectants (teat dips and sprays) according to the manufacturer’s instructions keeping dip cups and spray devices visually clean cleaning excessive dung from floors and stallwork keeping milking equipment clean at all times When checking your milk and animals, you should: examine the milk from each animal at each milking before milking that animal separate abnormal milk and do not use it for human consumption separate milk from animals showing clinical signs of udder disease and do not use it for human consumption identify any animals which are producing milk unfit for human consumption and then mark them to ensure that their milk is kept out of the food chain Preventing contamination You should ensure all teats are clean before milking by cleaning every cow and removing visible soiling, such as faeces, bedding, mud and residual post-milking disinfectants. Such cleaning will also reduce the amount of bacteria present. Avoid dry wiping as this does not remove many bacteria. After thoroughly washing and drying the teats, you should wipe them with disinfectant-impregnated towels or treat with an approved pre-dip solution. This must be effectively removed before cluster attachment - eg by drying with paper towel. Do not move dusty feeds or bedding materials close to the milking area immediately before or during milking. This is because large volumes of air are drawn into milking equipment during cluster attachment and removal, through air bleeds and during milk transfer. Keep bungs and covers in place at all times and during milking. There should also be a closure around the delivery pipe into the milk tank. You should ensure milk contact surfaces are made of food-grade materials and kept clean and well maintained. You should protect milk from contamination during transfer and storage, and cool it quickly to minimise bacterial multiplication. For daily collection, the temperature should not be more than 8°C or a maximum 6°C if collection is not daily. Site and structure of milking area Your milking area should be sited and constructed to ensure satisfactory hygienic conditions during milking. The area and immediate surroundings must be kept clean and you should have an adequate supply of clean water in the area for cleaning. Before milking animals in a cowshed, you should make sure the floor under the cows, dung channels and operator walkways are clean. You should manage these areas during milking to reduce the risk of contamination. Never store milking units in a cow shed. Milk storage area A milk storage room is considered a food storage area. As such, it should be used only to cool and store milk, and for the cleaning and storage of milking equipment. The room should be clean at all times and must be sited in a clean area, away from obvious sources of contamination. It is good practice to have separate milk storage rooms and wash up areas. The room’s design should help maintain hygiene by having, for example: impervious floors, which are free draining to a suitable trapped drain external drainage should not be allowed to enter the room walls that are smooth and easy to clean full height doors in good condition, with smooth surfaces, which fit well and are - kept closed or are self closing a roof/ceiling that is smooth, impervious, easy to clean and dust proof windows that are undamaged and kept closed unless protected by fly-proof mesh adequate fly proof ventilation adequate artificial lighting that is free from rust or flaking paint and fitted with shatter-proof covers water heaters that are sited outside in a clean environment fittings that are smooth and impervious, free from rust and flaking paint compressors and vacuum pumps should not be located in the milk storage room a hose for cleaning the milk storage room Your hygiene management responsibilities for the milk storage room are vital and should include: adequate facilities for the person doing the milking to wash their hands and arms keeping the room’s approaches and surroundings clean providing a bin and emptying it daily taking preventative measures against vermin, birds and other animals washing troughs and covering them to prevent condensation ensuring proper ventilation - natural or fan-assisted If you use a separate washroom for milking equipment, it must be constructed and managed on similar lines to prevent milk contamination. Outdoor milk storage tanks must be: suitably sited - with at least 600 millimetres of clear space around the tank to allow cleaning properly constructed and adequately sealed cleaned and disinfected after each milk collection If any part of the tank is sited outside the farm’s milk storage area - eg outdoors - you should make sure the tank outlet, air vent and inspection hatch are designed and managed to prevent contamination of milk. Access to milk storage areas Access to a milk storage area should be hard standing - eg concrete - and large enough for: clean access for the tanker driver - from cab to milk storage area collection hoses to be placed on clean surfaces There should be no direct access between the milk storage room and livestock housing or handling areas, toilets or feed stores. If possible, you should ensure there is no direct access to parlours, motor rooms and offices. Automatic milking systems If you use an automatic milking system ( AMS ), the milking area should be closed off as much as possible. You may need to use positive pressure ventilation to force air away from the milking area. The floors immediately below and surrounding the machinery should slope away from the milking area. You should not store any dung or slurry nearby. Operator hygiene considerations for dairy production Milk production staff must be trained in food hygiene, health risks and use of equipment. They must have clean hands and forearms before and during milking and milk handling. Any exposed skin wounds should be hygienically covered using the first aid kit, which should be available in the area. Operators must also wear clean outer clothing. The use of latex, or equivalent, gloves is recommended. Veterinary supervision of dairy farms You should clearly identify any animal that has been treated with a veterinary product. You should also observe any milk or meat withdrawal periods specified by your vet. Keep any records of the use of veterinary products in a secure place. Veterinary records should be updated within 72 hours with the: date of administration identification of animal(s) product name quantity used milk withdrawal period meat withdrawal period You must also keep records on feed supplies, disease that may affect the safety of the milk, and results of samples and checks made on animals or their products. FSA carries out regular inspections of milk producing holdings. Dairy farms must by law register with them and let them know if there are any significant changes to their facilities, or if they stop producing milk for sale for human consumption. Fore milking and abnormal milk Fore milking is a way of checking milk for physical, chemical or organoleptic abnormalities. It can help detect mastitis early, removes potentially contaminated milk from the teat canal, and stimulates milk let down. Abnormal milk or milk from cows with udder disease must not be used for human consumption. You should exclude abnormal milk by: milking affected animals last, with a full sanitiser cleaning routine after each milking milking into a dump bucket or dump line with a clean, well maintained separate cluster and milk tube Read about stock keeping and milking cattle in the guide on cattle movement and welfare . Animal health and hygiene on the farm You should manage animal housing to prevent soiling of the animals, while design features should reduce the risk of contamination from sources such as dust, flies, birds or other animals. Open parlours are acceptable provided your standards of hygiene management are high. Birds must be excluded, together with excessive dust contamination from outside. The best practice is to use a parlour that can be properly sealed off from other buildings. Floors should be water resistant and free draining, with all drainage discharged to a suitable drainage system. Roof or loft floors should be made of dustproof sheet material and be easy to clean. False ceilings must be solid, and you should take steps to prevent vermin infestation in the void. There must be enough ventilation to provide clean air and avoid condensation. Doors and walls should be smooth, solid and easy to keep clean. Make sure there is a fall from the area under the udder so it can be kept clean and free from pooling during milking. Artificial lighting should ideally be strip lights with shatterproof and waterproof diffusers. It is essential to provide good visibility for all milking and cleaning operations. Cubicles Each cow should have access to a cubicle, designs for which should encourage the animal to lie down inside. Use the largest cows in your herd as a guide for the size of the cubicles. Adjusting brisket boards and head rails will help prevent the animals soiling their beds. Good bedding can also minimise soiling and improve animal comfort. Mats or mattresses should be used with absorbent bedding material. If a cow refuses to use a cubicle and becomes heavily soiled, it must be cubicle trained, culled or kept wherever you can clean it - eg loose housed or at grass. If you milk cows in a cowshed, the floors under the cows, the dung channels and operator walkways should be kept clean. Loose yards Loose yards should not be overcrowded. For average cows of 600 kilograms, you should provide a bedded area of 6.5 square metres (m²) and a loafing area of 2.5m² per animal, with water troughs sited in the bedded area. You should provide daily bedding and completely remove used bedding every four to six weeks. Animal health Clean animals are more likely to remain disease-free and are less likely to contaminate milk with harmful bacteria. Improve animal cleanliness by: altering diets to minimise loose dung manually removing dirt grooming your cattle with cow brushes all long tails should be trimmed and all tails should be clipped at housing and again around mid-February, after which they are allowed to grow flaming udders and/or clipping flanks, bellies and udders to reduce the amount of soil or faeces which can stick to these areas Milk from animals testing positive for tuberculosis or brucellosis - or where there are two inconclusive tests - must not be used for human consumption. You should isolate such animals, milk them last and use a full sanitising routine to clean the equipment afterwards. The milk should then be disposed of. See the guide on dealing with animal by-products . Signs of poor health in dairy cattle include: discharge from the genital tract enteritis with diarrhoea and fever infection of the udder Animals with infectious diseases should also be isolated in facilities with separate drainage and airspace, and good ventilation. Isolation space should be easy to clean and disinfect. You should consider whether you will need to milk in the facility and how you will remove carcasses if necessary. Animal feed Dairy farmers receiving direct payments under EU or rural development schemes must satisfy cross compliance requirements, based on food and feed laws. These requirements are listed in the statutory management requirements and domestic legal requirements requiring land to be kept in good agricultural and environmental condition. SMR (statutory management requirement) 11 is designed to ensure the safe production and use of: food for human consumption food or feed for consumption by food-producing animals See the guide on farmed animal feed and food law . Cleanliness of animals and equipment Milk can be contaminated at any point in the production process. You should identify vulnerable points and introduce protective control measures. There are several type of contamination: bacterial - eg from poor milking practices, inadequate cleaning, poor disinfection of milking equipment and bulk milk tanks, soiled hands and equipment, or not cleaning and disinfecting teats before milking mastitis pathogens (bacteria), blood and clots - from undetected abnormal milk dung - from soiled animals, especially teats, udders and tails mould spores perished components in milking machines and bulk tanks dust bedding materials insects animal hair chemical contamination from veterinary product residues, cleaning chemicals or through the use of non-food-grade equipment Preventing contamination at milking Good milking practices that can reduce the risk of contamination include: examining milk for physical and chemical abnormalities and those detectable by taste, smell, sight or touch (organoleptic) cleaning teats, udders and adjacent parts - eg flanks, hindquarters, tails and abdomen - before milking rejecting any abnormal milk keeping hands, contact surfaces and milking equipment clean at all times keeping all animals clean using lying areas that are big enough, clean and dry keeping passageways, access routes, loafing areas and cubicles free from accumulations of dung, slurry and stale feed, and free draining maintaining fields, tracks and gateways, and keeping them free from dung, slurry and mud You should thoroughly clean all milking area floors, walls, fittings and touch points after every milking. The upper walls and ceiling should be kept free from dust and cobwebs. Between milkings, animals can have access up to the entrance or exit of the milking area. However, you must prevent dung, slurry and other noxious materials building up on floors, walls and fittings in these areas. Use of water for cleaning Use a hose of enough volume and force to wash equipment and cow standings thoroughly during and after milking. Warm running water, preferably containing a suitable disinfectant, should be available to rinse and wash hands, protective clothing, udders and equipment. Provide paper towels and a bin to dispose of them and other waste. Bins should be emptied after each milking. All water used in the parlour and milk storage room should be either safe to drink or clean water. Use water that’s safe for drinking when washing hands, udders and teats, and for rinsing and cleaning equipment. Private water supplies must be approved for bacteriological purity by your local authority, which may ask for water supplies to be treated before they can be used for dairy purposes. Header or storage tanks should be protected from contamination by rodents, birds, insects and dust. Your water supply’s chemical composition will affect your choice of detergents. It will also determine how often you need to use treatments to prevent scale in water heaters or deposits in milking equipment. Recommended cleaning systems In order to clean efficiently, you should ensure that you use: the correct strength of chemicals the correct method for using chemicals an adequate flow rate of the cleaning solution the correct distribution of cleaning solution to all components You should also hose down equipment to keep it clean during milking, and after each milking and before circulation cleaning, scrub exterior surfaces with a warm sanitiser solution. You should clean interior surfaces using either the hot circulation or acidified boiling water methods. You should clean vacuum pipelines at least once a month, and check and clean ‘blind’ areas daily. These include clawpiece bungs, buttons, screw-threads and recorder jar reject taps. Cleaning methods for tanks You should clean an area at least 600 millimetres around the exterior of tanks. If any part of the tank or silo is outside the milk storage area, you should manage the outlet, air vent and inspection hatch to prevent milk contamination. You should keep the exterior of tanks clean. You should also clean the interior surfaces every time the tank is emptied by: rinsing with drinkable water cleaning with sanitiser rinsing with drinkable water Other methods of sanitising the interior of tanks include: manual cleaning with an iodophor solution or chemical powder paste automatic cold cleaning - using an iodophor or acid-based cleaning solution automatic hot cleaning - using a hypochlorite based sanitiser For hot alkali systems, you will usually also have to treat tanks periodically with milkstone remover. Iodine solutions, however, are in acid, so tanks sanitised with these need periodic cleaning with alkali. Controlling pests, vermin and other animals You must take adequate measures to control insects, rodents and birds on the premises to prevent milk contamination, including: removing rubbish and vegetation from around the milking and milk storage areas keeping all feed in closed containers removing waste feed after every milking removing waste milk from the milk storage area after every milking controlling insect and animal pests sketching rodent baiting points and recording when bait is renewed fitting fly screens to windows sealing holes in walls fitting brush or rubber flaps to ill-fitting doors and drainage outlets Do not allow pets or poultry into the milk storage, milking or animal housing areas. Milk marketing standards The EU publishes marketing standards for drinkable milk, and also publishes legal definitions for the terms ‘whole milk’, ‘semi-skimmed milk’ and ‘skimmed milk’. Milk is defined by the EU as the produce of the milking of one or more farmed animals. Drinking milk is a product intended for delivery or sale, without further processing for consumers, either directly or through intermediaries such as restaurants or hospitals. Drinking milk can be: raw - not heated above 40°C or treated for the same effect whole - heat treated with the fat content of at least 3.5 per cent semi-skimmed - heat treated with fat content of between 1.5 per cent and 1.8 per cent  skimmed - heat treated with fat content of 0.5 per cent maximum Milk content and modifications The fat content of milk is defined as the ratio - by mass - of parts of milk fat per hundred parts of milk. Protein content is the ratio by mass of parts of protein per hundred parts of milk. To avoid confusion, you should inform your customers of your milk’s exact nature and composition. You can modify milk in the following ways: changing the fat content by adding or removing cream, or by mixing with whole, semi-skimmed or skimmed milk enriching with milk proteins, mineral salts or vitamins reducing the lactose content by converting it to glucose and galactose European school milk subsidy scheme The aim of the EU -funded school milk subsidy scheme is to encourage children to consume milk and milk products and develop a lasting habit of doing so. Within England, Scotland and Wales the scheme is administered by the RPA . Pupils regularly attending pre-schools, nursery, primary or secondary schools are eligible under the scheme. Milk or milk products must be distributed to pupils as a mid-morning or afternoon drink, as part of a meal or on breakfast cereal, but not milk used in the preparation of meals. Nurseries and other pre-school establishments can claim the subsidy through their nursery milk claim. Maintained and self-organising schools would normally claim through their local authority, however it is also possible for them to claim through a milk supplier or through an organisation set up specifically to claim the subsidy on behalf of schools. All claimants must be approved by the RPA .  Milk products from cows, goats and sheep are eligible for the subsidy but only: plain whole and semi-skimmed milk flavoured whole and semi-skimmed milk plain yoghurt Subsidy payments are paid on the actual quantity supplied to pupils - up to a maximum of 250 millilitres per pupil per day. The total subsidy claimed must not be higher than the price paid to the supplier. The prices charged to the beneficiaries may also include up to 7 pence per serving for administration, distribution and refrigeration costs. Claims for payments under the school milk subsidy scheme must be made to the RPA and are normally claimed at the end of each school term. The Welsh Government also funds the provision of free school milk, excluding yoghurt, for Key Stage 1 pupils in Wales. The RPA therefore reimburses the full cost of milk supplied to KS1 pupils in Wales. Schools and pre-school establishments must display a poster in the main entrance stating that they provide subsidised milk.

/guidance/intervention-and-private-storage-aid-schemes,"Financial support for traders and farmers from intervention and Private Storage Aid schemes Intervention and Private Storage Aid schemes Private storage aid Intervention schemes Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Introduction This guide is aimed at traders who may be able to benefit from ‘intervention’ and Private Storage Aid ( PSA ) schemes. The aim of these schemes is to offer financial support at times when the prices of certain products - eg cereals and some dairy products - are weak. In other words, these schemes are not available at all times. These schemes operate throughout the European Community (EC), under the authority of the European Commission. In the UK, they are managed by the Rural Payments Agency ( RPA ). Both types of scheme work by temporarily removing surplus product from the market. Intervention schemes involve you selling quantities of your product into intervention. This enables RPA to manage these stocks strategically to help keep market prices of that product stable. With PSA schemes, you retain ownership of the product but receive EC payments in return for keeping agreed quantities in storage - and off the market - for a set period of time. How intervention schemes work Intervention schemes are market support measures that help to stabilise the prices of certain products. The schemes are funded by the European Union and managed in the UK by the RPA . When prices of eligible products - eg cereals and butter - become low because of a surplus to demand, the European Commission may instruct RPA to buy some of this surplus stock and store it on behalf of the EC. This intervention to remove surplus product from the open market has the effect of stabilising prices for traders. Intervention schemes can be seasonal or in response to exceptional market conditions. When intervention is opened for a particular product, farmers and traders are invited to offer eligible product for sale into intervention. The product offered needs to meet strict quality standards. If you tender to offer product and your bid is accepted, you will be contracted to deliver this stock to public intervention storage. In return, you will receive a price related to the agreed intervention price for that product. In some schemes, you can also offer to sell a product into intervention but store it in situ - in return for additional storage fees. Although the product is stored on your premises it becomes the property of the EC, so strict storage rules apply. Stocks held in storage can then be sold out of intervention at a later date (when notified by the European Commission to do so) - when the market has recovered or for specified end uses. Registering with RPA You must be registered with RPA to offer products for intervention. To register, you can call the RPA Customer Service Centre on Telephone: 0345 603 7777. You will be asked to supply: your business name and contact details the name and address of anyone you want to have the authority to act on behalf of your business your bank details (these details cannot be taken over the phone but a form will be sent to capture these) Read about registering with RPA on the RPA website . The cereals intervention scheme If you are a farmer or trader registered with the RPA , you can offer to sell common wheat or barley into intervention. Your offer must be submitted during the buying season for cereals - currently 1 November to 31 May. Offers of barley into intervention is now only available by ‘Regulation opening the tendering procedure’. The Commission will notify intervention agencies when the opening Regulation is to be introduced. The minimum quantity you can offer is 100 tonnes, but this can be made up of cereal pooled from up to four separate locations. The minimum for in situ takeover is 5,000 tonnes. To be accepted into either scheme, your cereal must meet at least minimum quality standards. The current base price for cereal sold into intervention is €101.31 per tonne. So, the intervention price for May 2010 is €104.53 per tonne. You will be paid the equivalent in pounds sterling at the exchange rate when your grain is provisionally accepted by the RPA . Download form CEPU1 to offer to sell cereal into intervention from the RPA website (PDF, 69KB) . You can submit your completed application by post to the RPA at the following address: Rural Payments Agency Lancaster House Hampshire Court Newcastle Upon Tyne NE4 7YH You can also email the form to cerealsintervention@rpa.gsi.gov.uk . If your offer is for wheat, you will also need to send the relevant test fee. The current test fees are: £392 plus VAT - for an offer based at one location £429 plus VAT - for an offer based at two locations £466 plus VAT - for an offer based at three locations £503 plus VAT - for an offer based at four locations In situ offers You can also offer to sell cereal into intervention to be stored in situ and under your control on your premises. The minimum amount of cereal for an in situ offer is 5,000 tonnes. If you are approved to store grain in situ, your premises must meet certain criteria in terms of size, temperature, facilities and access. You will be paid storage fees in addition to the purchase price of the grain. This rate is published before the start of each season and is currently £2.87 per tonne per day for the first year. To become an in situ offerer, you must register normally before the 31 August - ahead of the buying season due to start later that year. RPA will then arrange for your store to be inspected and assessed for suitability. After making your offer Once you have had an offer provisionally accepted, RPA will make arrangements for your grain - in the case of wheat - to be sampled and tested. If you are offering barley, this may also be inspected first. After any testing, you will be told if your grain is acceptable and - where applicable - given instructions on delivering your grain to an intervention centre. You must arrange and cover the costs of this delivery. When the final delivery has been made, you need to complete a claim form and submit it to RPA to organise payment. Download RPA information on selling your cereal into intervention from the Agricultural Document Library ( ADLib ) website (PDF, 856K) . Butter intervention scheme If you are a farmer or trader registered with the RPA , you can offer to sell eligible butter into intervention. Your offer must be submitted during the buying season for butter - currently 1 March to 31 August. Note that only unsalted butter is eligible for intervention. Salted butter is not eligible. The EC’s decision on whether to allow butter intervention is based on average EU market prices, which are reported to the Commission each week. You can find information about the EU dairy market on the Europa website . Eligibility In order for your unsalted butter to be eligible for intervention it must: have been manufactured in the 31 days preceding the date your offer is received be produced by a creamery that’s been approved by RPA be unsalted be produced directly and exclusively from pasteurised cream have a minimum butter fat content of 82% by weight have a maximum water content of 16% by weight meet certain compositional and quality standards meet minimum quantity and packaging rules You must be able to offer a minimum quantity of 20 tonnes in one lot in 25 kilogram containers. You will also need to support your offer with a security payment of €50 per tonne. You can find more information on butter intervention on the RPA website](http://rpa.defra.gov.uk/rpa/index.nsf/0/B5692C711EB3BC9580256F72003DB670). Delivery and payment If your tender bid is successful, you will be given details of a cold store which will expect delivery of your butter within 28 calendar days of receiving confirmation that the bid has been successful. It’s your responsibility to arrange this. You will lose your security for any quantity not delivered within that time limit. Your butter will be sampled after it has been delivered. Assuming it passes the quality control tests and is accepted into intervention, you will be paid at either the standing intervention purchase price or the agreed price in your offer document. If your documentation is in order and legible, all payments will be made no later than the 65th calendar day following the takeover date. There is no longer a payment window. Read information on selling your butter into intervention on the RPA website . Find forms and information about butter intervention on the RPA website . The skimmed milk powder intervention scheme If you are a farmer or trader registered with the RPA , you can offer to sell eligible skimmed milk powder ( SMP ) into intervention. Your offer must be submitted during the buying season for SMP - currently 1 March to 31 August. The European Commission’s decision on whether to allow SMP intervention is based on average EU market prices, which are reported to the Commission each week. You can find information about the EU dairy market on the Europa website . Eligibility Conditions for your SMP to be eligible for intervention include that it must: be produced by a business that’s been approved by RPA be manufactured by the spray process be produced directly and exclusively from skimmed cow’s milk meet certain compositional and quality standards be manufactured within a specified time frame meet minimum quantity and packaging rules You must be able to offer a minimum quantity of 20 tonnes in 25 kilogram bags. You will also need to support your offer with a security payment of €50 per tonne. Delivery and payment If your tender bid is successful, you will be given details of a store which will expect delivery of your SMP within 28 calendar days of receiving confirmation that the bid has been successful. It’s your responsibility to arrange this. You will lose your security for any quantity not delivered within that time limit. Your SMP will be sampled after it has been delivered. Assuming it passes the quality control tests and is accepted into intervention, you will be paid the full intervention price applicable on the date the SMP was manufactured. If the SMP ’s protein content is less than 34%, your payment will be reduced accordingly. If your documentation is in order and legible, all payments will be made no later than the 65th calendar day following the takeover date. There is no longer a payment window. Find forms and information about SMP intervention on the RPA website . The beef intervention scheme You can only offer your beef for sale into intervention storage when beef intervention is opened by the EC. The Commission may decide to do this if the average price of UK beef falls below a set value for two weeks in a row. There is currently no intervention beef purchasing taking place in the UK or any stocks of intervention beef held in storage. Eligibility When intervention is open, only slaughterhouses approved under Council Directive 64/433 - or livestock and meat traders who have their slaughtering carried out in such a slaughterhouse - can apply to offer beef into intervention. You must also be registered with the RPA and registered for VAT. When intervention is open, everyone who has expressed an interest in offering - and is eligible - will be invited to tender. This invitation will include details on how to bid and the deadline for tender submission. The types of beef you can offer vary and are decided by the Commission, but your bid must offer a minimum of 10 tonnes. You will need to support your offer with a pounds sterling security payment equivalent to €30 per 100 kilograms. This will be at the exchange rate applicable on the day you submit your bid. This security will be released once you have delivered the beef you are contracted to deliver. To be accepted into intervention when the scheme is open, your carcasses and half carcasses must: originate from within the European Community be from animals under 30 months of age on the day of slaughter come from carcasses weighing less than 340 kilograms have obtained the health mark referred to in Directive 64/433 have all risk materials removed be fit for storage and future use not have been slaughtered due to emergency measures be from animals raised according to current veterinary requirements not exceed maximum radioactivity levels Delivery and payment When the beef intervention scheme is open, and if your bid is accepted, RPA will tell you where and when to deliver your quartered carcasses for cold storage. RPA will arrange to have the beef boned and boxed too. However, if you prefer, it may be possible to arrange an additional payment from RPA to carry out the boning yourself. Health checks will be carried out on the beef after slaughter and again on entry into the boning hall. Once the beef has been accepted, RPA will arrange for a takeover certificate and your subsequent payment. Your payment is based on your original tender price and the total bone-in weight of carcasses taken over. Private Storage Aid Based on the market situation the EC will decide if and when it is appropriate to open a PSA scheme. Schemes can be opened using either fixed aid in advance or a tendering procedure. When such a decision is made, a regulation is published announcing the opening of the scheme and setting out rates of aid and application procedures. PSA is similar to an intervention scheme. Both help to stabilise the market of a particular product by removing supplies that are surplus to demand when prices become weak. This can be temporary - where the product is later re-released for sale on the EC market - or permanent - where the product is eventually exported from the EC. The key difference is that a producer or trader contracted to a PSA scheme retains ownership of any product entered into storage. With intervention schemes, the RPA takes over control of the products bought on behalf of the EC. PSA may be opened from time to time by the European Commission for the following products: butter - salted or unsalted sheep or goat’s cheese white sugar olive oil beef pigmeat sheep or goat meat PSA is currently only available in the UK for butter - see below for more details. If you sign up to a PSA scheme, after one is announced, the products entered must be kept in storage for a specified period before you are allowed to release them back onto the market or export from the EC. In return, you will be paid a rate of aid set by the Commission that takes into account: your storage costs normal depreciation of quality any foreseeable increase in the price of the product The terms of the scheme will set a minimum and maximum contractual storage period. Eligibility To apply for PSA , you must be registered with RPA and have your storage facilities inspected and approved. Your business also needs to be registered for VAT. For butter, your PSA application will not need to be supported by a security payment unless after 60 days of storage you wish to apply for an advance payment. The security shall be equal to the advance payment, plus 10%. This security money is refunded provided you have fulfilled all your contractual obligations. PSA scheme rules are strict, with tight audit controls for successful applicants. If you are found to have broken the rules, you would lose your security and lose out on any aid payments. You may also be suspended from the scheme. Download detailed RPA information about PSA from the ADLib website (PDF, 113KB) . PSA scheme for butter PSA is currently available for eligible butter. Applications must relate to quantities you already have stored. To be eligible, the butter must: have been produced in an RPA -approved creamery have been produced during the 28 days leading up to your application meet packaging and labelling rules The composition requirements for unsalted butter are that it must have a: minimum butter fat content of 82% by weight maximum non-fat milk solids content of 2% maximum water content of 16% Salted butter composition requirements are that it has a: minimum butter fat content of 80% by weight maximum non-fat milk solids content of 2% maximum water content of 16% maximum salt content of 2% Read details about the PSA scheme for butter on the RPA website .

/guidance/using-the-peach-system-to-import-plants-and-fresh-produce,"How to register with and use the Procedure for Electronic Application for Certificates (PEACH) online system to comply with regulations when importing plants or fruits and vegetables.  Using the PEACH system to import plants and fresh produce Crops and horticulture  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Introduction The Procedure for Electronic Application for Certificates ( PEACH ) is an online tool for fulfilling a number of important requirements when importing plants or fruits and vegetables that are subject to Specific Marketing Standards into the UK from outside the European Community. Imports of plants and plant products must be accompanied by a phytosanitary certificate to confirm their health. You must provide advance notice through PEACH that a consignment is about to enter the UK. This guide explains how to register with and use PEACH . It outlines the regulations that PEACH can help you comply with, and it sets out the steps involved in using PEACH to apply for a Certificate of Conformity or to pre-notify plant health-controlled imports. PEACH applies to England and Wales but not Scotland or Northern Ireland. However, it does apply to Scottish and Northern Ireland businesses, whose imports arrive from either England or Wales. Scottish importers should contact the Scottish Government Rural Payments and Inspections Directorate on 08457 741 741. Those from Northern Ireland should contact the  DARD Helpline on 028 9052 4999.  An overview of the PEACH system The PEACH system helps you comply with pre-notification requirements for certain consignments being imported into the EU . PEACH can be used for consignments of fruit, vegetables, nuts and other goods covered by the European Community ( EC ) Marketing Standards and consignments of goods covered by plant health regulations. PEACH and the EC Marketing Standards Two distinct sets of EC Marketing Standards stipulate quality and labelling requirements for consignments of fresh produce being imported into the UK from any non- EU country. You can  find the new and existing fresh fruit and vegetables marketing standards on the Rural Payments Agency ( RPA ) website . A Certificate of Conformity - issued by the UK’s Horticultural Marketing Inspectorate ( HMI ) - indicates whether a consignment has met the quality and labelling requirements as set out in the EC Marketing Standards. However, since July 2009, a range of fruit and vegetables no longer requires an HMI conformity certificate at import. However, the following ten types of fresh fruit and vegetables must continue to comply with Specific Marketing Standards and will continue to require notification prior to import and certification: apples citrus fruit kiwi fruit peaches and nectarines pears strawberries table grapes lettuces, curled-leaved and broad-leaved endives sweet peppers tomatoes If you do not have a Conformity Certificate for any of these commodities your consignments will not be cleared to free circulation in the UK. All consignments must be accompanied by a Certificate before they can be customs cleared. Register for PEACH on the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs ( Defra ) website . The PEACH system may be used by traders - or their agents - to apply for a Certificate of Conformity. However, use of PEACH is not mandatory for this purpose. Paper applications will also be accepted, although the goods in question will normally be subject to a physical inspection. PEACH and plant health regulations PEACH also deals with import consignments covered by EU -wide plant health regulations. These require that most plants, some plant products and produce imported from outside the EU be accompanied by a phytosanitary certificate and that imports of these goods must be pre-notified to the UK’s Plant Health and Seeds Inspectorate. Traders - and their agents - must use the PEACH system to pre-notify any import consignments of goods requiring a phytosanitary certificate. Using PEACH is mandatory in this instance - there is no paper-based alternative. HM Revenue & Customs ( HMRC ) also require a quarantine release certificate ( QRC ), issued following completion of inspection formalities, to secure the release of plant-health controlled consignments into free circulation. The QRC can be printed from the PEACH system and faxed to HMRC . You can download guidance on which products are covered by the plant health regulations from the Food and Environment Research Agency ( Fera ) website (PDF, 403K) . You can also  download a user guide to pre-notification on PEACH from the Fera website (PDF, 1.3MB) . The PEACH system applies to England and Wales but not to Scotland or Northern Ireland. However, it does apply to Scottish and Northern Irish businesses whose imports arrive first in English or Welsh ports. Scottish importers should contact the Scottish Government Rural Payments and Inspections Directorate on 08457 741 741. Those from Northern Ireland should contact the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development ( DARD ) Helpline on 028 9052 4999.  How to open a PEACH account To open your PEACH account, you will also need to register with the Government Gateway. There are a number of steps involved in opening the two accounts. The first step is to open a PEACH account. Register for the PEACH system from Defra . Entering your contact details generates the first of two pieces of information, or ‘known facts’, which are used to identify you. The first known fact is your Company ID. Once your application has been approved, you are sent the second known fact - your trader number. You will then need a Government Gateway account to log in to PEACH , so the next step is to register as a new user on the Government Gateway website -  find out about registering for online government services at the Government Gateway website . You are recommended to print out the screen containing your new User ID and keep it in a safe place. You can also use an existing account, if, for example, you have registered for another service on the Government Gateway. If you register with our site you will automatically receive a Government Gateway account. Download a guide to registering on the Government Gateway from the RPA website You’ll need your User ID and your Government Gateway password to log in to the PEACH system for the first time. The PEACH system applies to England and Wales but not to Scotland or Northern Ireland. However, it does apply to Scottish and Northern Ireland businesses whose imports arrive first through English or Welsh points of entry. Scottish importers should contact the Scottish Government Rural Payments and Inspections Directorate on 08457 741 741. Those from Northern Ireland should contact the  DARD Trade Helpline on 028 9052 0207.  Using the PEACH system The PEACH system has a range of useful features. Its online tools can save your business administration time and can also enhance your business efficiency. Using the tools that PEACH offers enables you to move your consignments through customs with the minimum of delay. Many of the forms you complete will require the same core information. To save you time, your completed application forms are saved for re-use. You can re-use this information on future applications from the drop down list under Use a previous form. If you are an agent with a number of traders linked to you, you will need to select the trader on whose behalf you are making the application. Similarly, as a trader you may choose from a number of agents you have been previously linked to. A trader-agent link can be made when both parties have contacted the PEACH helpdesk or their local office. Register for PEACH on the Defra website . Use the View Outstanding Applications button to see all of your outstanding applications, with their current risk assessment. To find out what the symbols mean, select Show Legend at the top of the screen. If you have a large number of applications on the PEACH system, you can locate a specific application - outstanding or completed - using the search facility. If the application number you enter is valid, the application will be displayed. If you are applying for a Certificate of Conformity you can use the PEACH system to print out your certificate, once your application has been approved. If your consignment is refused entry, you’ll be told why your consignment failed its inspection and what you need to do to bring it into conformity. Common reasons for consignments being refused entry include missing information pertaining to country of origin, or incorrect labelling. If you are using PEACH to pre-notify of an import consignment under the plant-health regulations, once all the necessary checks have been made by the Plant Health and Seeds Inspectorate you will be able to print out a Quarantine Release Certificate from the PEACH system. This enables clearance of the goods when faxed to HMRC . When pre-notifying consignments due to arrive by air, you must notify the Plant Health and Seeds Inspectorate ( PHSI ) at least four working hours’ ahead of their expected arrival time. For all other imports you must give PHSI at least three working days’ advance notification. The PEACH system applies to England and Wales but not to Scotland or Northern Ireland. However, it does apply to Scottish and Northern Ireland businesses whose imports arrive first through English or Welsh points of entry. Scottish importers should contact the Scottish Government Rural Payments and Inspections Directorate on 08457 741 741. Those from Northern Ireland should contact the DARD Helpline on 028 9052 4999.  The laws PEACH can help you to comply with When you’re importing commercially, it’s important to know about regulations that apply to specific products as well as general legislation that might affect your business. The PEACH system helps businesses to comply with two key sets of regulations. The EC Marketing Standards Two sets of standards are set out in European and UK legislation - the Specific Marketing Standard ( SMS ) and the General Marketing Standard ( GMS ) - and they impose both quality standards and labelling requirements. The SMS regulates ten types of fresh produce - apples, table grapes, kiwi fruit, citrus, peaches and nectarines, pears, strawberries, lettuce (including curled-leaved and broad-leaved endives), sweet peppers and tomatoes. The GMS applies to most other fresh fruit, vegetables, nuts, herbs and cultivated mushrooms that are not intended for processing. You can  read about these marketing standards and access their guidance on the RPA website Many popular types of fruit, vegetables and nuts are excluded from EC Marketing Standards - eg potatoes, sweet potatoes, bananas and peanuts. For more information on importing regulated fruit and vegetables, you can contact your regional Horticultural Marketing Inspectors on the RPA website . The EU Plant Health Directive Under the EU -wide plant health regime, imports to the UK of most plants and some plant products and produce from outside the EU must be accompanied by a phytosanitary (or ‘plant health’) certificate. Imports of these goods must also be notified in advance to the PHSI . Broadly speaking, the rules cover all planting material, all major fruit (excluding bananas and grapes), cut flowers, some leafy vegetables, as well as potatoes from a limited number of countries. The phytosanitary certificate confirms that the goods have been inspected in the country of origin and are free from certain serious pests and diseases and substantially free from other harmful organisms. The inspection referred to in a phytosanitary certificate must have been carried out no more than 14 days before the date of dispatch of the import consignment in question. HMRC also require a QRC , issued following completion of inspection formalities, to secure the release of plant-health controlled consignments into free circulation. The QRC can be printed from the PEACH system and faxed to HMRC . For more information about importing controlled plants, you can download a plant health guide for importers from the Defra website (PDF, 107K) . For more information about importing foodstuffs and other organic produce, see agriculture, horticulture and fisheries and food and drink . The PEACH system applies to England and Wales but not to Scotland or Northern Ireland. However, it does apply to Scottish and Northern Ireland businesses whose imports arrive first through English or Welsh points of entry. Scottish importers should contact the Scottish Government Rural Payments and Inspections Directorate on 08457 741 741. Those from Northern Ireland should contact the DARD Helpline on 028 9052 4999. How to apply for a Certificate of Conformity using PEACH The PEACH system can help you apply for the Certificate of Conformity needed for specific imports of fresh produce from outside the EU . To obtain a Certificate of Conformity, you must first enrol on the PEACH service. Register for the PEACH system from the Defra website To access the service, you need your Government Gateway User ID and password from when you registered on PEACH . The PEACH system is designed to be user friendly. If you have any difficulties, you can contact the PEACH Helpdesk on 0345 607 3224 or email them at peachenquiries@defra.gsi.gov.uk The PEACH system applies to England and Wales but not to Scotland or Northern Ireland. However, it does apply to Scottish and Northern Ireland businesses whose imports arrive first through English or Welsh points of entry. Scottish importers should contact the Scottish Government Rural Payments and Inspections Directorate on 08457 741 741. Those from Northern Ireland should contact the DARD Helpline on 028 9052 4999.  Import Risk Assessment for goods requiring a Certificate of Conformity If you import fresh fruit, vegetables, salad crops or nuts into the UK from outside the EU , and they are subject to the EC Specific Marketing Standards, they may need a physical inspection. This inspection is carried out by the Rural Payments Agency ( RPA ) Horticultural Marketing Inspectorate ( HMI ), and the produce must pass the inspection before a Certificate of Conformity is granted. For applications made using the Procedure for Electronic Application for Certificates ( PEACH ) system, a risk assessment is conducted using the Import Risk Assessment System ( IRAS ). Each consignment is given a risk category. They are: red for high risk - where possible, all consignments in this category are physically inspected amber for medium risk - for consignments placed in the amber category, an inspector will decide whether a physical inspection is necessary green for low risk - consignments in this category are automatically granted a Certificate of Conformity There are ten criteria that determine these risk categories. Find guidance on the IRAS risk criteria on the RPA website . Physical inspections usually take place at the point of entry of your consignment. However, if you apply for - and meet - the requirements of the Local Clearance Procedure within Customs Freight Simplified Procedures (CFSP), the inspections may be carried out at your own premises.  Read about the CFSP system on the HMRC website . If your imported goods are covered by both the EC Marketing Standards and by plant health regulations, your consignment will only be inspected once. HMI inspectors have been trained to identify key plant health issues and plant health inspectors will notify HMI of any marketing standards concerns that arise. “Paper” applications for Certificates of Conformity can be made without using the PEACH system and sent to the inspectors at the point of entry of your consignment or to a local HMI office. However, these applications are normally treated as red - high risk - and are subject to a physical inspection and could result in delays before customs clearance. You should be aware that the responsibility for labour charges incurred in any such inspection is borne by the applicant of the certificate. Paper applications are not accepted for imports covered by plant-health regulations - these must be pre-notified using PEACH . If your consignment fails to meet EC Marketing Standards, you will be liable for any charges needed to bring your consignment up to the required standard for entry into the UK. Labelling is a common reason for failure and could result in your whole consignment having to be checked. Any labour charges are borne by the applicant of the certificate. Consignments must also comply with HMRC requirements. All documentation must be in order before a consignment is given customs clearance. The PEACH system applies to England and Wales but not to Scotland or Northern Ireland. However, it does apply to Scottish and Northern Ireland businesses whose imports arrive first through English or Welsh points of entry. Scottish importers should contact the Scottish Government Rural Payments and Inspections Directorate on 08457 741 741. Those from Northern Ireland should contact the DARD Helpline on 028 9052 4999. How to pre-notify your plant-health controlled imports using PEACH You must use the Procedure for Electronic Application for Certificates ( PEACH ) system to provide advance notice to the  Fera PHSI of any import consignments covered by plant health regulations. For more details about these regulations, you can download a guide to the plant health regime for importers from the Defra website (PDF, 107K) . To log in to the PEACH system, you will need the Government Gateway User ID and password generated when you first registered on PEACH . There are three key stages in the process of providing advance notice to the PHSI of your plant health controlled imports so that they can be cleared to enter the country: You must register the details of your impending imports to PEACH . This information is received by PHSI inspectors, who then carry out physical inspections, documentary checks and identity checks in respect of each commodity being imported. You can monitor the progress of these checks through the PEACH system. When the physical, documentary and identity checks have been finished and approved, you will be able to clear the consignment by printing a Quarantine Release Certificate from PEACH and faxing it to HMRC . The PEACH system applies to England and Wales but not to Scotland or Northern Ireland. However, it does apply to Scottish and Northern Irish businesses whose imports arrive first in English or Welsh ports. Scottish importers should contact the Scottish Government Rural Payments and Inspections Directorate on 08457 741 741. Those from Northern Ireland should contact the  DARD Helpline on 028 9052 4999.  Making the most of PEACH Once you feel confident using the PEACH system, there are a number of things you can do to save your business time and improve your efficiency. PEACH automatically saves applications. If they are part-filled, they are saved for completion later - if they are completed, they are saved for re-use as templates. You can therefore use completed applications as templates for other applications, which will save you time. If you employ an agent to handle your imported consignments, their details should be set up on the PEACH system. You and your agent should let their local regional inspection office or the PEACH helpline know that they will be representing your importing business.  Contact your local Horticultural Inspections office on the RPA website . The front page of the PEACH system has a link - Perform Bulk Uploads - which can be used to transfer bulk information from your system to PEACH . This facility is particularly useful for large importing businesses. You can download reference information to help you generate this file from the PEACH website. The PEACH system also allows you to view statistics based on your applications. This tool can provide useful data for your business, for example, why your consignments have been given a high-risk assessment. If you would like other people in your business to access your PEACH system, you can set up Assistants on your Government Gateway account. However, Assistants have limited access rights. They cannot enrol in new Gateway services or create or delete other Assistants or users. This can be useful if you, as the primary user, have used other systems on the Government Gateway and wish to restrict access to the information held on them. The PEACH system applies to England and Wales but not to Scotland or Northern Ireland. However, it does apply to Scottish and Northern Ireland businesses whose imports arrive first through English or Welsh points of entry. Scottish importers should contact the Scottish Government Rural Payments and Inspections Directorate on 08457 741 741. Those from Northern Ireland should contact the DARD Helpline on 028 9052 4999.

Use an Ordnance Survey map from another source If using an OS map from a source other than the Forestry Commission, applicants must: show the markings needed on the map for the application produce the map at a scale of 1:1250, 1:2500, 1:5000 or 1:10000 and show the scale clearly on each map draw one clearly-labelled cross near the centre of the map, or near the application area, giving the position of an 8 figure grid reference (2 letters and 6 numbers) Each map must also give at least 2 horizontal and 2 vertical grid lines showing both: a square grid of 1km at the scale of 1:10000 and 1:5000 a square grid of 100m at the scale of 1:1250 and 1:2500 The grid lines must be clearly annotated with OS National Grid Eastings and Northings. Use an Integrated Administration and Control System compliant map Applicants can submit a photocopy of an Integrated Administration and Control System ( IACS )-compliant map instead. The map will still need to be marked and labelled and sent with the application. Make sure there are no details hidden by other markings. Use another type of map Applicants can only send a different map with their application if it: is produced by a computer using a GIS shows an accurate backdrop and all the required features Compartments: identify the land included in an application Mark the map with compartments. These are different areas of woodland that can be identified or managed separately. Compartments are individual woodlands, or parts of larger woodlands. They are defined by physical features such as: roads watercourses tracks land use changes Most small farm woodlands are considered to be one compartment. How to mark compartments Follow these steps to create compartments: Mark the boundaries on the outside of all the woodland edges, along tracks, fences, streams and ownership boundaries. Mark any boundaries of important designations such as Sites of Special Scientific Interest, Special Areas of Conservation, Special Protection Areas, Scheduled Ancient Monuments, Ancient Semi-Natural Woodland and Plantations on Ancient Woodland Sites. Number each individual area. Subcompartments: divide compartments Compartments can be divided into smaller subcompartments. Divide the land into subcompartments and mark out boundaries for: physical and other major differences management differences administrative differences Physical differences Create subcompartments for permanent features on the ground such as: woodland edges fences tracks Management differences Create subcompartments where the land has differences such as: differences in species, eg conifer, broadleaved or mixed areas significant age differences between adjoining areas the environmental status of the woodland area features such as rides and open glades Also create subcompartments for areas that will be managed differently, such as: land on river or watercourse banks (riparian zones) specific wildlife habitats public access facilities Administrative differences Applicants can create subcompartments where there are administrative differences, even if the adjoining woodland areas are similar, such as: different ownership different grant support significant differences in management and usage A felling licence or funding for undertaking work could also affect the land. For example, if planting new trees, use subcompartment boundaries to mark out the new woodland. Or if intending to fell an area of woodland, show the boundary of the area being felled and how it will be restocked afterwards. How to mark subcompartments Only mark subcompartments for the areas included in the application. Each subcompartment should normally be no smaller than 0.1ha and can incorporate very small areas into adjoining subcompartments. Mark out the boundaries on the map, making sure they are clear so that grants are applied to the correct areas and they don’t overlap. Label each individual area with a unique reference. The unique reference must be made up of a number and a letter, eg 7D. The number represents the compartment and the letter represents the individual part of that woodland. Applicants can also place items on a certain percentage of a subcompartment so that they don’t need to divide the areas further, eg tree shelter on 25% of subcompartment 3A. Examples of compartments and subcompartments The picture on the left is compartment 1 and shows the outside edge of the woodland. The example on the right shows the same woodland divided into subcompartments. How to mark boundaries and features Keep the map precise and uncluttered. Applicants can use a second copy of the map to give additional details about the land with more colours, notes and labels. When completing the map: use red ink for boundaries so that they contrast with the base map use a fine roller-ball point or draughtsman style pen highlight the boundary make sure folds or imperfections on paper maps don’t hide details Highlight boundaries that can’t clearly be shown on the map and describe them on a separate page. For example, if a boundary follows the centre of a stream. View [InlineAttachment:1] of the following map annotation marks that must be used. Scheme boundary Draw a red external boundary line, no wider than 0.7mm. Highlight the inside of the boundary in colour with, for example, a yellow highlighter. Make sure that the colours don’t hide the base map detail. Access point Use clearly-labelled red crosses, as many as needed, to show where FC staff are permitted to enter the woodlands. Compartment boundary Use a red dash/dot line no wider than 0.7mm. Compartment number Write the number inside the area, or clearly link to it with an arrow. Numbers can go up to 9999. Subcompartment boundary Use a red line of long dashes no wider than 0.7mm. Subcompartment letter Write a single letter after the compartment number. Track/permissive path/public footpath Use a black line of short dashes no wider than 0.7mm and write the feature type next to it. Wayleave (all wires, pipes, pylons etc) Use a black line no wider than 0.7mm with alternate chevrons and write WL (Wayleave) next to it. Watercourse Use a black line no wider than 0.7mm and write WS (water supply) next to it."
/government/news/uk-boosts-global-efforts-against-illegal-wildlife-trade,"Multi-million pound funding available to help tackle poaching and the illegal wildlife trade UK boosts global efforts against illegal wildlife trade  Foreign & Commonwealth Office Department for International Development Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Up to £5 million of UK Government funding will made available to initiatives around the world to help tackle the cruel trade in rhino horn, elephant ivory and other illegal wildlife products, Defra Minister Rory Stewart will announce today. Poaching is rife in parts of Africa, with 1,293 rhinos killed last year and over 20,000 elephant deaths attributed to poaching in 2013. The UK is playing a leading role in global efforts to tackle the illegal wildlife trade, which involves international criminal networks and undermines the economies of our trading partners in Africa, Latin America and Asia. Round Two of the Illegal Wildlife Trade Challenge Fund will support practical action against wildlife crime by strengthening law enforcement, reducing demand for illegal products and by helping communities develop sustainable conservation schemes. Speaking at a meeting on the illegal wildlife trade at the Zoological Society of London, Defra Environment Minister Rory Stewart said: The illegal trade in animal products is putting some of our most iconic species like elephants, rhinos and tigers in severe danger. This is not just an environmental challenge: tackling this trade means tackling corruption, strengthening security and improving livelihoods. This funding will help to reduce the supply of illegal wildlife products by supporting local communities to find new ways of earning a living and stopping poachers and criminal networks from controlling this barbaric trade. It will also support action to reduce demand for these products. International Development Minister and FCO Minister for Africa Grant Shapps said: The illegal wildlife trade is a global problem, and is not confined to any one country or even continent. The range of projects helped by this Challenge Fund already is testament to that, and demonstrates valuable work being done worldwide to stop the killing. It’s absolutely right that the UK’s development budget is tackling international wildlife issues, giving communities a real alternative to this horrific trade and helping to protect the world’s most endangered animals. I am determined that the UK will keep raising the illegal wildlife trade at every opportunity to ensure that we have a world worth leaving to the next generation.” Director of Conservation Programmes at ZSL Professor Jonathan Baillie said: The 2014 London Conference on the Illegal Wildlife Trade greatly escalated political will to address this crisis, but greater effort is needed on the ground if we are to stop the needless slaughter of iconic species such as elephants, rhino and pangolins. ZSL and the conservation community greatly welcome Defra’s Illegal Wildlife Challenge Fund, which will provide essential resources to help curb demand, sustainable livelihoods to communities effected by illegal wildlife trade and help to strengthen the criminal justice system and enforcement on the ground.’ Since its launch in 2014, Defra’s Illegal Wildlife Trade Challenge Fund, with support from the Department for International Development, has supported 19 projects in developing countries to protect endangered species such as rhinos, elephants and snow leopards, and stop the criminality and conflict associated with international trafficking of illegal wildlife products. Organisations will be able to bid for funding for projects in developing countries that address the following themes: Developing sustainable livelihoods for communities affected by illegal wildlife trade. Strengthening law enforcement and the role of the criminal justice system. Reducing demand for the products of the illegal wildlife trade. The £5 million of new projects is part of the Illegal Wildlife Trade Challenge Fund announced by DFID and Defra in December 2013. International Development Secretary Justine Greening announced an additional £3 million for the Fund in March 2015, taking the total to £13 million. Further information Photos from the event"

/guidance/pig-keepers-identify-animals-before-moving-them,"How to identify pigs and piglets before moving them off your holding.  Pig keepers: identify animals before moving them Pig identification, registration and movements Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs You must tag, tattoo or mark pigs aged 12 months or older with your official herd mark before they leave your holding. The only exemption is if you’re moving piglets aged 12 months or less between 2 farms. Types of identifier You can use any of these identifiers: an ear tag a tattoo on 1 of the animal’s ears 2 slap marks applied to both of the pig’s front shoulders using permanent ink Ear tags must start with the letters ‘UK’ and information must be printed or stamped, not handwritten. Slap marks and tattoos don’t need to include the letters ‘UK’. You can use compressed air equipment to apply slap marks. Information required on identifiers All identifiers you apply must show your herd mark. You must also select a unique identification number for the pig and add it to the identifier, if you’re moving pigs to: an exhibition or show an artificial insemination ( AI ) centre or any other breeding location another country (within, or outside the EU) You don’t have to select an identification number and add it to the identifier if you’re moving pigs anywhere else, eg to another holding, market or abattoir. Identify piglets You don’t have to tag, tattoo or mark pigs aged 12 months or less with identification details, if you’re moving them from one farm holding to another farm holding. For such moves you can instead identify them using a temporary paint mark, eg a red line, black cross, or blue circle. The mark must last until the piglet reaches the destination holding. The piglet must be accompanied by a haulier summary / movement document ( HS/MD ) which identifies the holding from which it was moved. If you’re moving pigs aged 12 months or less anywhere else, (eg to a market, abattoir or show) you must tag, tattoo or mark them with identification details like adult pigs. Identify imported animals You must tag, tattoo or mark any pigs you import from outside the EU to your holding with your herd mark. You don’t have to tag, tattoo or mark the pigs, if you’re sending them for slaughter within 30 days of their arrival in the UK."

/guidance/sustainable-procurement-tools,"Find out what good practice in sustainable procurement looks like and what tools are available  . Sustainable procurement tools  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Sustainable procurement tools Sustainable procurement isn’t just about buying ‘green’ products. It also includes: planning ahead to manage demand effective ongoing contract management dealing with supply chain risks and impacts Procuring the future gives a good working definition, stating that sustainable development “achieves value for money on a whole life basis in terms of generation benefits not only to the organisation, but also to society while minimising damage to the environment.” If done properly sustainable procurement makes sound business sense. Unless we take into account the whole costs of goods and services (including energy and water use) and the costs of managing wider social costs (like pollution impacts, carbon emissions and waste disposal), we will not achieve value for money in a meaningful sense. The tools set out below will help you do this: Government Buying Standards ( GBS ) GBS are a set of easy to use product specifications for public procurers. They are set at ‘mandatory’ and ‘best practice’ levels. Under the Greening Government Commitments all central government departments and their related organisations must ensure that they meet the mandatory levels of the GBS . ‘Best practice’ criteria are for organisations that want to take the lead in sustainability. These either set the bar higher for existing criteria, or add further criteria that need to be fulfilled. The GBS are owned by Defra. Individual standards are developed with input from across government, industry and wider stakeholders. They are extensively reviewed with market research and analysis to establish criteria that take long term cost effectiveness and market capacity into account. Our approach to developing and supporting Government Buying Standards sets this out in more detail. The GBS can be used in planning a procurement to get a quick insight into key sustainability issues. Explore whether you can meet your GBS requirements by using an existing collaborative framework. GBS can be used as technical specifications in tender documents. If you’ve already awarded long term contracts, work with your suppliers to introduce GBS during contract management - they are not only the ‘green’ option but are designed to deliver value for money over the long term. Sustainable procurement training The National Sustainable Public Procurement Programme (NSPPP) provides training on sustainable procurement. The Flexible Framework tool The Flexible Framework spreadsheet and guidance is a widely-used self-assessment package which allows organisations to measure, monitor and improve how they procure. Prioritisation tool The prioritisation tool helps organisations prioritise their sustainable procurement activities in key product areas. It also helps in developing procurement strategies and action plans that address economic, environmental and social issues. London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games construction guidance Guidance on sustainable construction procurement draws on lessons from the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. EU Green Public Procurement GBS are aligned to the European Commission’s Green Public Procurement programme initiative. By using the Government Buying Standards you will also be able to meet EU-wide criteria and comply with UK commitments and priorities. Defra has produced guidance on the EU Green Public Procurement programme and its relationship with the GBS .

/guidance/air-quality-economic-analysis,"This guide explains how impacts on air quality should be incorporated into a cost benefit analysis. Air quality: economic analysis Air quality Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Introduction Air pollution harms human health and the environment. A conservative estimate for one type of pollution (particulates) is that it reduces average life expectancy in the UK by around six months, worth £16 billion a year. HM Treasury’s Green Book guidance provides the framework for economic appraisal and evaluation of all Central Government policies, programmes and projects. In line with its advice, you should reflect air quality impacts in decision-making wherever possible. Supplementary Green Book guidance on how to value changes in air quality is available to help you do this. This web page outlines the techniques available to government analysts (local or national) that are covered in more detail in the supplementary guidance. Selecting a technique Use the damage cost approach to estimate the size of your proposal’s total air quality impacts. If the impacts are less than £50 million and do not affect compliance will legal limits on air pollution then you can report the damage cost estimates. If impacts are greater than £50 million then the impact pathway approach is appropriate. If your proposal is expected to affect compliance with legal limits on air pollution then you should use the unit abatement cost approach for emission changes exceeding the limit (use the damage cost approach for changes below the limit). If the air quality impacts exceed £50 million, consider a detailed abatement assessment. Damage costs approach Damage costs are a simple way to value changes in air pollution. They estimate the cost to society of a change in emissions of different pollutants. Damage costs are provided by pollutant, source and location. This is appropriate for small air quality impacts (below £50 million) provided your proposal does not affect areas likely to breach legally binding air quality limits. A full list of damage costs is available (see below, under ‘Further information on damage cost guidance’). Table 1 provides the most commonly used damage costs used to assess national policies, programmes and projects. The values provided in table 1 are presented in £ per tonne of emission change. Table 1: Air quality damage costs per tonne, 2015 prices   Central (1) Central sensitivities (2) Low High Oxides of nitrogen (NOX) Transport average £25,252 £10,101 £40,404 Industry £13,131 £5,253 £21,010 Domestic £14,646 £5,859 £23,434 Particulate Matter ( PM ) Transport average £58,125 £45,510 £66,052 Industry £30,225 £23,665 £34,347 Domestic £33,713 £26,396 £38,311 Sulphur oxides (SOX) £1,956 £1,581 £2,224 Ammonia (NH3) £2,363 £1,843 £2,685 (1) This estimate is intended for use only where a single point estimate is necessary and should always be accompanied by the central range. (2) The central sensitivity for PM , SOX and ammonia reflect uncertainties around the lag between exposure and the health impact. The sensitivity for NOX also reflects the uncertainty around the link between NO2 exposure and mortality. Further information on damage cost guidance September 2015: The damage cost for NOX was updated on 12 September 2015 to reflect the latest evidence. The new values should be used instead of the values published in “Air quality damage cost guidance”. [InlineAttachment:5] More information on these changes and the use of these values: [InlineAttachment:6] [InlineAttachment:1] Impact pathway approach Proposals with large air quality impacts (over £50 million using damage costs) that are not expected to affect compliance with legal limits should be assessed using the impact pathway approach. In these instances you should contact Defra for advice. The impact pathway approach is a more detailed way to value air quality changes. It estimates air pollution costs based on location-specific modelling of how changes in pollution affect air quality, but relies on standard estimates of impacts and their valuation. Guidance on impact pathway approach Abatement costs Proposals that change emissions in a way that affects compliance with legal obligations should use the abatement costs approach. The abatement costs recognise that changes in emissions will affect the level, and cost, of action required to comply with such obligations. Where the proposal affects emissions in other locations, or below the limit, you should use the damage cost or impact pathway approach as appropriate. You will need to know the levels of pollution in relevant areas and the current legally binding air quality objectives. Guidance on the abatement cost approach Unit abatement costs You can use unit abatement costs if the air quality impact of your proposal is below £50 million. Nitrogen dioxide is the main pollutant likely to cause non-compliance with legal obligations and unit abatement costs for NO₂ are available in £/tonne. These reflect the likely technologies available to reduce NO₂ emissions in 2015, based on current policy. Unit abatement costs are available in the air quality supplementary guidance or the abatement cost guidance. Nine possible unit abatement costs are provided and you should select the most relevant technology for the central case and higher/lower values as sensitivity tests. Detailed abatement assessment If your proposal affects compliance with legal obligations, and air quality impacts are estimated at over £50 million, please [contact Defra] (mailto:igcb@defra.gsi.gov.uk) for advice. You will need to consider in detail how your proposal changes the level of abatement action needed to offset your proposal’s impacts on legal obligations. For example, if your proposal increased emissions from a particular source, you could examine abatement opportunities, and their costs, specific to the affected location.

This guide covers more specific legal requirements for some particular food products. It also explains the requirements for ‘best before’ and ‘use by’. Food standards legislation sets out specific requirements for the labelling, composition and, in some cases, safety parameters for specific high value foodstuffs which are potentially at risk of being misleadingly substituted with lower quality alternatives: bottled water bread and flour cocoa and chocolate products fats and oils fish fruit juices and nectars honey jams and preserves meat and meat products milk and milk products soluble coffee sugar Legislation sets requirements for food labels in the UK and aims to ensure food labels are an honest presentation of food. The requirements in place ensure consistency for the industry and for consumers. Food labelling legislation is harmonised at an EU level. In England, responsibility for food labelling legislation and policy is split across Defra , the Food Standards Agency (FSA) and the Department of Health (DH). For Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland all domestic standards legislation is the responsibility of the FSA. This guide includes Defra ’s table of mineral waters recognised in the UK and how to notify Defra or the FSA about newly recognised mineral waters or make amendments. It also covers the Codex international standards that are not legally binding are generally considered good practice. They ensure fairness in international trade and make sure consumer interests are protected. Bottled water Bottled waters are split into 3 categories: natural mineral water, spring water and bottled drinking water. Each has their own rules and requirements on exploitation, sale and how they are labelled. Natural mineral waters must come from a recognised underground source and can only be subject to very limited treatments. Any water labelled ‘spring water’ must come from an underground source and meet certain exploitation and labelling requirements but does not need to be from an officially recognised source. Bottled drinking can come from any water source and has fewer labelling restrictions than the other 2 categories.

The aim of the list is to let local enforcement officers know which producers can advertise their product as a natural mineral water and to prevent producers from duplicating names. Defra updates the list whenever it is notified of newly recognised natural mineral waters, withdrawals of recognition or changes to the trade description or the name of the spring. English local authorities who wish to notify Defra of any amendments to the list should email bottled.water@defra.gsi.gov.uk Local authorities in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland should contact the relevant FSA devolved office with any amendments to the list as they have responsibility for the equivalent Regulations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

Bread and flour The Bread and Flour Regulations 1998 lay down specific labelling and compositional standards for the breads and flours to which they apply. They also continue with a long standing national requirement to restore to all flour, except wholemeal, with certain vitamins and minerals such as niacin, thiamin, iron and calcium to certain types of flour manufactured and sold in the UK. They also define terms like wholemeal and self raising. Defra is intending to consult on these regulations in 2014. [InlineAttachment:7] Cocoa and chocolate products Certain cocoa and chocolate products must comply with the reserved descriptions set out in the Cocoa and Chocolate Products Regulations 2003 . The rules lay down the composition of chocolate and products including setting minimum ingredient requirements and specific labelling requirements. The amount of cocoa solids and milk solids that must be present are stipulated as well as allowing only certain additional ingredients to be added. A cocoa solids declaration such as X% minimum is required for most chocolate products covered by the rules and also where appropriate a milk solids declaration is required. This enables consumers to make informed decisions about the type of chocolate they want to purchase. If you use one of the reserved descriptions covered in the regulation then your product must be made according to the defined compositional criteria. Fats and oils Legal standards on composition exist for fats and oil exist for labelling them as an ingredient ‘vegetable oil/fat’. In addition there are very specific rules on the labelling and composition of spreadable fats, such as butter and margarine. These set out permitted fat ranges for each type of spreadable fat: dairy spreads made with milk fat; fat spreads made with vegetable fats; and blended spreads which contain a mix of both types of fat. The legal names for a particular spread must appear prominently on packaging. The Spreadable Fats (Marketing Standards) and the Milk and Milk Products (Protection of Designations) (England) Regulations 2008 Fish: species names, commercial designations and labelling Rules are in place to make sure fish is labelled correctly and consistently at the point of sale, so purchasers know exactly what they are buying. The rules require information on: the commercial designation of the species (ie an agreed common name for the species of fish) the production method (ie whether caught at sea, caught in inland waters or farmed) the catch area (ie either the ocean area, or in the case of freshwater fish, the country in which it was caught or farmed) There are new requirements to provide: the scientific name a declaration on whether the fish was previously frozen Updated rules in the form of The Fish Labelling Regulations 2013 have recently come into force which adds new commercial designations (the names of fish) for species of fish that have recently come onto the market and give extra options for some others that were already listed. An updated guidance note has been produced to accompany the Regulations. Guidance for The Fish Labelling Regulations 2013 UK Commercial Designation List Fruit juices and nectars The Fruit Juice and Fruit Nectars (England) Regulations 2013 came into force on 20 November 2013 implementing the changes to EU rules on juices and nectars in EU Directive 2012/12/EU. These rules define terms such as fruit juice, fruit juice from concentrate, concentrated fruit juice, water extracted fruit juice and fruit nectar. The new regulations combine all existing rules on fruit juices and fruit nectars. The rules set minimum requirements for fruit juice quality but provide more flexibility for industry to provide consumers with greater choice. This will provide greater legal clarity and reduce the burden on the fruit juice industry. The new rules include an updated approach to enforcement. They also take into account technical progress and innovation in the manufacturing of juices. What are the main changes I need to be aware of? Juice Processing Move from mandatory to optional restoration of aromas and flavours. This recognises that for some fruits, aromas are unable to be collected or are of insufficient quality to add back. Addition of a new category of juice called “water extracted fruit juice”. This covers juice produced by the diffusion of water with pulpy whole fruit or dehydrated whole fruit e.g. “prune juice” The freezing of fruit is now allowed as an approved method of preserving fruit used in juice production. The minimum Brix values for blackcurrant, guava, mango and passion fruit have been changed to align with the values in the international worldwide Codex Standard on juices Tomato juice is now covered and needs to comply with the new regulations Sugar addition The addition of sugar to fruit juices is no longer permitted. As a result ‘no added sugar’ claims on fruit juices will also no longer be allowed. Up until 28 October 2016 business may use a factual statement “from 28 April 2015 no fruit juices contain added sugars” in order to inform consumers that fruit juices will no longer contain any added sugars. For nectars containing added sweeteners “no added sugar” claims will no longer be allowed. Labelling The product name needs to reflect the fruits used in descending order of their quantity used in the product. Fruit purée used in fruit juice production can now be regarded as a “juice”. For example an “orange juice and mango puree” product could now be called “Orange and Mango juice”. Enforcement Food authorities who are responsible for enforcing these rules, will now use improvement notices for compliance issues backed up with criminal sanctions on failure to comply with a notice. Businesses will have the opportunity to appeal against an improvement notice to the First-tier Tribunal. Other A definition of ‘flavour’ has been added. Water used to restore fruit juice from concentrate needs to comply with Council Directive 98/83/EC on the quality of water intended for human consumption. New guidance to the Regulations is being produced as part of Defra ’s Smarter Guidance project and will be published here shortly. Honey Honey composition and labelling is controlled by the Honey (England) Regulations 2003 as amended. This legislation lays down reserved descriptions that must be used which relate to the source from which the honey is obtained (eg blossom, honeydew), or the processes by which it is extracted (eg drained, extracted) and also the way it is presented (eg comb, chunk honey). The regulations lay down detailed specification honey must comply to in terms its composition and also set out some general quality criteria for honey. In addition the regulations contain some specific labelling requirements including a requirement for country of origin labelling on honey where appropriate. If you use one of the reserved descriptions then your product must be made according to the defined compositional criteria. The Honey (England) Regulations 2003 The Honey (Amendment) (England) Regulations 2005 Jams and marmalade A consultation on revising the Jam and Similar Products Regulations is being held with a view to updating UK domestic legislation. Jam and similar products must comply with the reserved descriptions as set out in the Jam and Similar Products (England) Regulations 2003 . These include compositional requirements such as minimum fruit and sugar requirements and specific labelling requirements such as labelling the amount of fruit and sugar in a jam or marmalade. Products covered include jam, extra jam, jellies and marmalades. In addition only certain ingredients are allowed to be added. The regulations also provide national rules for mincemeat and fruit curds. If you use one of the reserved descriptions then your product must be made according to the defined compositional criteria. Milk products For milk products there are legal standards that set out compositional and labelling requirements and also protect the use of dairy terms when marketing foods. Specific legal standards exist on the composition and labelling of ice cream, cream, casein and caseinates, certain UK cheeses and condensed/dried milk. The use of terms such as milk, cheese, cream, yogurt, etc is also protected so they may only be used for the associated dairy products and not misused to describe non-dairy produce. The Food Labelling Regulations 1996 The Condensed and Dried Milk (England) Regulations 2003 The Condensed and Dried Milk (England)(Amendment) Regulations 2008 The Casein and Caseinates Regulations 1985 (No. 2026) The Casein and Caseinates (Amendment) Regulations 1989 The Spreadable Fats (Marketing Standards) and the Milk and Milk Products (Protection of Designations)(England) Regulations 2008 Meat products For a range of meat products there is legislation setting out specific compositional and labelling requirements. The rules set out minimum meat content requirements for certain meat products sold using reserved descriptions such as sausages, burgers, corned beef, meat pies, pasties, etc. In addition, there are very specific labelling rules for certain meat products that look like a cut, joint, slice, portion or carcase of meat. Where any added water over certain limits as well as any added ingredients of different animal species to the rest of the meat must be mentioned in the name of the food. The Meat Products (England) Regulations 2003 The Meat Products (England) (Amendment) Regulations 2008 The Food Labelling (Amendment) (England) Regulations 2003 Soluble coffee Instant coffee is controlled by rules covered in The Coffee Extracts and Chicory Extracts (England) Regulations 2000. These define soluble coffee extracts and chicory extracts in terms of their coffee and chicory content and also provide for rules on their labelling. Cocoa and Chocolate Products Regulations 2003 The Coffee Extracts and Chicory Extracts (England) Regulations 2000 Sugars Regulations exist which lay down reserved descriptions for certain types of sugar products sold as such to the final consumer. These rules set out specifications for the sugar products covered and in some cases provide for additional labelling requirements. Products covered by the rules include white sugars, dextrose, glucose syrups and fructose. Specified Sugar Products Regulations 2003 ‘Best before’ and ‘use by’ The ‘best before’ date is appropriate for the vast majority of foods and indicates the period for which a food can reasonably be expected to retain its optimal condition (eg it will not be stale) and relates to the quality of the food. The ‘use by’ date is the required form of date mark for those foods which are highly perishable from a microbiological point of view and which are likely after a relatively short period to present a risk of food poisoning, and relates to the safety of the food. Guidance on the application of date labels to food gives the latest advice and guidance. It includes a short guide especially prepared to assist small and medium sized businesses. It aids compliance with the law and assists food businesses which do not have in-house knowledge or expertise to decide which date marks should apply to which foods and if they need to seek further advice eg from their Local Authority or a specialist food consultant. The guidance does not change the use of ‘sell by’ or ‘display until’ dates although it does reiterate existing best practice advice that these dates are confusing to consumers. The Codex standards (Codex Alimentarius) The Codex Alimentarius is a series of food standards and related texts. They aim to provide a high level of consumer protection and fair practice in the international trade of food and agricultural products. Food standards are becoming more important as international trade in food opens up and consumers are more concerned about safety and quality. Standards must provide a high level of consumer protection and not unnecessarily restrict trade. Codex is recognised in the relevant World Trade Organisation (WTO) agreements as the international body able to provide these guarantees. In the event of a trade dispute Codex standards would become accepted reference documents for its settlement. The organisation charged with the development of the Codex standards and related texts is the Codex Alimentarius Commission ( CAC ). This is an intergovernmental body jointly sponsored by the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) and the World Health Organisation (WHO). The detailed work of CAC on drafting standards, codes of practice and other guidance is handled by about 30 Committees which fall into three general categories: commodity committees (eg milk and milk products), horizontal committees dealing with issues across a range of commodities (eg labelling, food additives) and regional committees (eg Europe). Defra acts as the national contact point for the UK in Codex and is responsible for: distributing all Codex papers relating to specific committee/s to interested parties and organising consultations on these issues to feed into the UK position on Codex responding to Codex on standards and other texts in the step procedure representing the UK at relevant Codex committee meetings Further details on Codex working procedures, committees and forthcoming meetings can be found on the Codex website . UK Codex contact point - codex@defra.gsi.gov.uk Food Information Regulation (FIR) Food Information Regulation (FIR) (1169/2011) was agreed and published on 22 November 2011, directly applicable on 13 December 2011. The majority of provisions will apply in 2014 and the nutrition declaration becoming mandatory in 2016. The scope of the regulation includes a number of key issues including mandatory nutrition labelling on pre-packaged food, Country of Origin, date marking (including date of first freezing), clarity of food information, alcohol labelling, labelling of non pre-packed foods and allergen labelling. Defra has consulted on this FIR and is developing the Statutory Instrument (SI) to provide enforcement regulations for FIR in the UK. We are also developing with industry guidance to help them conform to the FIR and will continue to work with stakeholders to ease the transition (mostly by 2014 in the UK)."

/government/news/stewart-new-plans-to-save-englands-hen-harriers,"Details of a new six point action plan published today to help the recovery of England's hen harrier populations.  Stewart: New plans to save England’s hen harriers  Natural England Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Plans to help revive the hen harrier, one of England’s most iconic birds, have been published today as part of the government’s ongoing commitment to preserve and enhance our nation’s natural environment. As a bird of prey, hen harriers make an important contribution to our intricate ecosystem – and are a well-loved feature of our skyline, but in recent years their numbers have dropped. The Hen Harrier Action Plan will for the first time co-ordinate action already taken by conservation groups, landowners and wildlife crime officers across the country to ensure a consistent and strategic approach. The plan will also encourage groups to share best practice to help reverse the decline of these precious birds. Environment Minister Rory Stewart said: This new plan will transform the fate of one of our most magnificent birds. We are working closely with conservation organisations and landowners and with their help, this plan will help hen harriers flourish once more while coexisting with a thriving rural economy. Our wildlife is a crucial part of our national identity. That’s why we care deeply about protecting this vital species for future generations to come. Natural England’s Director of Terrestrial Biodiversity Rob Cooke said: We welcome the publication of Defra’s Hen Harrier Action Plan which sets out an important set of actions to help improve the conservation status of hen harriers in England. Natural England is firmly committed to this shared plan and has been asked by Defra to lead on the implementation of some of the actions set out in it. We are looking forward to working with a range of organisations and land managers to help secure a future for the hen harrier as a breeding bird in England. The plan was developed by Defra in conjunction with the RSPB, Game and Wildlife Conservation Trust, Moorland Association, National Gamekeepers Organisation, National Parks UK. Natural England will lead on the six point plan, working with organisations to: Monitor hen harrier numbers in England and the UK via satellite tagging and tracking; Share best practice with land managers and gamekeepers, encouraging the provision of food for birds of prey; Work closely with the Raptor Persecution Priority Delivery Group (RPPDG) to analyse intelligence on persecution and deliver more effective enforcement and deterrence measures; Monitor and protect nests and winter roosts from disturbance and destruction; Work with landowners to reintroduce hen harriers to suitable areas in the South of England; Scope out feasibility for trialling brood management. Some of these actions, like monitoring and sharing best practice, are already underway at known nesting sites, such as in the Forest of Bowland in Lancashire. Other actions, such as trialling brood management, will be looked into by Natural England which will work closely with partners to determine criteria for a field trial. This countrywide action has already seen nest figures increase last year, from four in 2014 to six in 2015. The plans will also help deliver on a key manifesto commitment for this government to conserve and enhance the environment as part of a comprehensive, long-term vision to protect the country’s natural heritage. Defra will publish a detailed 25 year plan for action on the environment later in the year."
/government/news/lasers-reveal-lost-roman-roads,"Archaeologists are using Environment Agency laser mapping data to rediscover hundreds of kilometres of 'lost' Roman roads. Lasers reveal 'lost' Roman roads  Environment Agency Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Since 1998 the Environment Agency has used lasers to scan and map the English landscape from above to help with work such as flood modelling and tracking changing coastlines. But these LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data are also publically available and have been used to help with everything from building virtual worlds to managing forests. This LIDAR data bonanza has proved particularly helpful to archaeologists seeking to map Roman roads that have been ‘lost’, some for thousands of years. Their discoveries are giving clues to a neglected chapter in the history of Roman Britain: the roads built to help Rome’s legions conquer and control northern England. For decades after the 43AD invasion, a large region of the North (including Lancashire, Yorkshire and Cumbria) was controlled by a Celtic tribe known as the Brigantes. Tacitus writes that it was the collapse of the marriage between Queen Cartimandua of the Brigantes, a Roman ally, and her husband Venetius that led to a showdown with Rome. Following their divorce, Venetius organised a revolt in 69AD and Cartimandua fled. The Emperor Vespasian then sent a force under Britain’s new governor, Quintus Petilius Cerialis, to put down the rebellion and conquer northern England. Building roads to link up forts and settlements across this rugged landscape was a vital part of this decades-long conquest of the North. David Ratledge has been researching Lancashire’s Roman roads for more than 45 years and recently used Environment Agency LIDAR data to discover 17km of a ‘lost’ Roman road from Ribchester to Lancaster. David Ratledge said: “These were the county’s most important Roman sites so good communications between them must have been essential. “Rather than following the Ordnance Survey route, it took a very sensible and economical route via Longridge and Inglewhite to Catterall, near Garstang. Here it joined the main Roman road from the south heading to Lancaster. “Previously in Lancashire we only had aerial photographs from the 1940s and 1960s to go on, but with photographs features only show up after a drought and we don’t get many of those! With LIDAR, once you know what to look for, it’s blindingly obvious – you just know you’ve found a road… It’s been revolutionary.” Roman roads were large structures, typically measuring 5-7 metres wide and reaching a height of around 0.5m in the centre. However, nearly two thousand years of weathering mean that they are often very difficult to spot at ground level. David Ratledge said: “The preservation of the remains varies massively. Parts of a road could still be half a metre high and easy to spot whilst in other parts it could be so subtle that you’d definitely miss it on the ground.” Experts Hugh Toller and Bryn Gethin have found at least 4 ‘lost’ Roman roads around the country using LIDAR with many more potential discoveries awaiting confirmation from fieldwork. In Cumbria, Hugh has used LIDAR data to prove the course of a road from the Roman fort at Low Borrowbridge, near Penrith, to Kirkby Thore, the site of a Roman cavalry camp. This is a missing part of a well known road called the Maiden Way that continues towards Whitley Castle and Carvoran Roman Fort, Northumbria, (near Hadrian’s Wall). LIDAR also provides evidence for a new section of this road past Kirkland. Hugh Toller said: “Often there are vague indicators of a route but not enough evidence to be sure. With LIDAR we can spot any ‘aggers’ – a Roman embankment or rampart – and if you find 2 or 3km of these running dead straight there is nothing it can be except a Roman road.” Hugh is currently working on 4 other Roman roads in northern England discovered from LIDAR that will help to reveal more about the history of Roman Britain. These run from Whitley Castle to Corbridge, from Bainbridge in Wensleydale northwards, from Ambleside to Papcastle and from Ambleside to Carlisle. There are several other ‘lost’ roads that he plans to put back on the map. In the future there could be many more discoveries as the Environment Agency is making all 11 terabytes of its LIDAR surveys available as open data as part of the #OpenDefra initiative. These data are available for everyone to use for free through the new Survey Open Data portal . Martin Whitworth, Deputy Director Data, Mapping, Modelling and Information at the Environment Agency, said: “Archaeologists have been real pioneers in showing us what can be done with our LIDAR data. “By making our LIDAR data open we hope not only to gain further insights into the past but also to inspire entrepreneurs, businesses, and communities to look to the future of how such data could be used to benefit the environment and our rural economy. “From forest management to walking apps, building game worlds to deciding where to plant crops, the uses of LIDAR data are endless.”"

The UK is a world leader in the fast growing agri-tech sector, as global challenges such as rising population, shortages of land, water and energy require better and more reliable production of food. This round of the government’s Agri-Tech Catalyst – alongside industry co-investment – has provided awards between £200,000 and £1.5 million to the most pioneering science and technology projects within the UK’s agricultural sector to help meet the global demand for food with the least environmental impact. !@4 Successful projects in the fifth round of funding announcements include the development of a robot that accurately eliminates and controls weeds, which will significantly reduce the use of herbicides in food production. Another project will look at why potato greening occurs and how to prevent it – helping to reduce the 100,000 tonnes of potatoes thrown away annually. Support has also been given to develop technology that will help fruit farmers monitor and control the storage of British apples – improving their availability window across the year and reducing the need for imports. Five projects will target challenges in developing countries, including improving methods to detect carcinogenic mould toxins in food crops. !@1 Life Sciences Minister George Freeman said: Agri-tech is fast becoming big global business, creating major investment and export opportunities for the UK. Whether extending the availability of UK apples to controlling the infection of cacao plants in Ghana, these innovative projects demonstrate the UK’s leadership in developing technologies and companies that will improve food and farming productivity in this country and around the world. Farming Minister George Eustice said: Although there has been great pressure on farm incomes over the past 12 months, I believe the industry has a good future and technological advances will help. Farmers have an essential role in building a strong economy and feeding the nation.‬‬‬‬‬ Taking innovations from the laboratory to the farm is key to boosting productivity, and tackling pests and diseases. That is why the government supports projects through our Agri-Tech Strategy, like those who have won today. !@3 Today’s investment will help grow the UK’s agri-tech sector – which new research published today reveals is worth around £14 billion to the UK economy and employs over half a million people. Research also shows the vital role of public and private partnerships in the recent success of agri-tech – with private investment in research and development reaching almost £500 million in 2012 to 2013. Today the next round - Round 6 - of the Agri-Tech Catalyst opened which will focus solely on international development projects and will be managed by the Department for International Development. International Development Minister Nick Hurd said: This next round of the Agri-Tech Catalyst offers a fantastic opportunity to help farmers in the world’s poorest countries access the latest technology and innovation, helping them to get the tools they need to lift themselves out of poverty. This has the potential to not only end dependency on aid, but also develop new markets for Britain to trade with. That’s why for this round I want to see new ideas that can make a real, lasting improvement to the lives of those who desperately need it. !@2 Background Agri-Tech Catalyst: The Agri-Tech Catalyst was set up by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills ( BIS ), Innovate UK, Department for International Development ( DfID ), Department for Food and Rural Affairs ( DEFRA ), and the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council ( BBSRC ) with a £70 million investment to help make the UK a world leader in agricultural technology, innovation and sustainability. The Agri-Tech Catalyst offers funding for collaborative projects, taking innovative ideas from any sector or discipline with the potential to provide an economic boost to the UK agri-tech industry, by tackling challenges in agriculture. The scheme helps take innovations all the way from concept to commercialisation, awarding grants for early stage, pre-industrial research feasibility studies, industrial research, and late-stage pre-experimental and experimental feasibility studies. Full summary of projects funded in Round 5: Agri-Tech Catalyst Round 5 – Early Stage Project 1: 3D Vision-based Crop-Weed Discrimination for Automated Weeding Operations Partners: University of Lincoln and Garford Farm Machinery Ltd Description: Current crop production systems have been reliant on the wide-scale application of herbicides to control weeds. However, this approach is not sustainable due to unprecedented regulatory and environmental pressures which place new emphasis on the development of novel techniques to kill weeds. This project will investigate the technical foundations for the next generation of robotic weeding machinery, enabling selective and accurate treatment of specific weeds. The proposed technology is a novel combination of low-cost 3D sensing and learning software together with a suitable weed destruction technique. The proposed developments will lead to more efficient cultural weeding equipment resulting in better management of weeds and reduced input use, bringing several benefits to food producers, sellers and society. Project 2: GrassVision - Automated application of herbicides to broad-leaf weeds in grass crops Partners: Soil Essentials Ltd; University of the West of England ( UWE ) and Aralia Systems Ltd. Description: GrassVision will use imaging and precision agriculture techniques to develop a novel spray apparatus for precision application of herbicides to broad-leaf weeds in grass crops. The GrassVision consortium consists of imaging experts (Centre for Machine Vision, UWE ), data analysis experts (Aralia Ltd.) and precision agriculture experts (Soil Essentials Ltd.). Sustainable production requires weed control methods to reduce herbicide use to comply with current and future EU legislation. The primary focus will be to detect weeds using novel 3D machine vision techniques. Initially the project will use off-the-shelf machinery to spray a targeted area around each weed, with an estimated aimed decrease in herbicide use of around 75%. The project will then look to determine the limits of precision by refining the boom itself. Using this approach, they hope to achieve an ideal target of a 5x5cm spray area per-weed, providing potential reductions in herbicide use in excess of 90%. Project 3: Low cost Hyperspectral Crop Camera ( HCC ) for agriculture optimisation Partners: Wideblue Ltd; Galloway & Macleod Ltd; the James Hutton Institute; University of Strathclyde and University of West of Scotland. Description: A consortium from a broad range of disciplines has come together to develop a revolutionary low cost crop camera that could potentially allow farmers to improve crop yield, use less fertiliser, use less pesticide and spot pests and diseases earlier. The project will be led and coordinated by Wideblue Limited - a developer and manufacturer of specialist cameras. The project will also call on the skills of the James Hutton Institute’s expertise in crop nutrition and monitoring, the University of Strathclyde’s Hyperspectral Imaging Centre, the University of the West of Scotland’s Institute of Thin Films, Sensors and Imaging, and Galloway & MacLeod’s intelligent agriculture division. Project 4: A novel Biopesticide formulation technology for major lepidopteran crop pests Partners: Exosect Limited; Lancaster University and University of Greenwich Description: Biopesticides are products based on the natural diseases of insects that can be used to protect crops against pests. They are environmentally friendly because they target only a limited group of insects and are safe to humans, livestock and beneficial insects such as pollinators. However, biopesticides have a number of shortcomings which mean that they are not commonly used. This project aims to develop an innovative approach to improve the field persistence, efficacy, shelf life and cost-effectiveness of viral biopesticides against the moth caterpillars that eat crops. It will build on tried and tested Entostat technology to better protect the biopesticide while in storage or on the crop, while also improving its capacity to kill pest insects. The opportunity exists to replace current foliar chemical insecticides in this sector with a biopesticide of equal efficacy and substantially lower environmental impact and this project will take an important step in this direction. Project 5: Strategies to reduce waste due to greening in potato tubers Partners: James Hutton Institute; University of Southampton; James Hutton Limited; Amcor Flexibles UK Limited; Branston Limited; Tesco Plc and Waitrose Limited Description: In the UK, tuber greening is directly linked to 116,000 tonnes of household potato waste each year with an associated estimated loss of £60 million per annum to UK retailers. In field losses due to tuber greening also cost the industry £37 million per annum. Greening is a significantly negative factor in consumer purchases where a 1% increase in sales is worth £3 million per annum to producers. This project brings together partners that span the food chain from production, through packaging, to major supermarkets who will work with academic researchers to develop solutions to reduce tuber greening. Photobiological experiments will identify the conditions and target genes for light-induced tuber greening informing the design of prototype packaging film to reduce greening during storage and in store. Recently developed potato genetic approaches will be used to identify markers for genes associated with reduced greening providing the foundation of a longer term strategy to produce new non-greening potato varieties. Project 6: Early detection of tail biting in pigs using 3D video to measure tail posture Partners: SRUC ; Innovent Technology Ltd; Agri EPI Ltd and J Sainsbury Ltd Description: Tail biting in growing pigs starts without warning. Outbreaks of tail biting result in pain and sickness for bitten pigs and economic losses for farmers, particularly when infection through tail wounds results in abattoir condemnation of meat. Recent research shows that a pig’s behaviour changes before a damaging tail biting outbreak starts. This project aims to develop a ‘smart farming’ product based on the latest video technology and machine-vision software to automatically detect these changes and warn farmers so they can intervene to stop tail biting. The project brings together SRUC ’s expertise in pig behaviour analysis, Innovent Technology Ltd’s machine vision software development skills with Sainsbury’s pig supply chain perspective to ensure that end user needs are met. Experience with on-farm 3D video, and access to a network of Agri-tech expertise will be facilitated by the Agri-EPI Centre. Project 7: Humane electric stunning Partners: Ace Aquatec Ltd; Bristol University Description: A novel method of electrically stunning farmed fish. Project 8: Aflascope: sample extraction procedures for improved aflatoxin management Partners: Crop-Innovations; Gorta Self Help Africa; Bora Biotech Ltd; Agsenze Ltd; Secure Harvest Ltd and PepsCAgo Ltd. Description: AflaScope is a cross-disciplinary collaboration to examine the feasibility of using an acoustic separation platform for purification of aflatoxins from crops. Aflatoxins (toxins from storage mould) are a significant threat to food security, particularly in developing nations. Testing and monitoring are vital but, due to complex sample prep, high cost, inaccessibility and lack of information, aflatoxin testing is not thoroughly implemented and billions of people are at risk. This innovative project will develop a novel, rapid and chemical-free procedure for extracting and concentrating aflatoxins. When integrated with down-stream diagnostic advances, the extraction platform could enable a low-cost, sensitive, portable test system for on-site aflatoxin monitoring, increasing ease and frequency of testing, and potentially improve decontamination. If successful, the resultant increase in crop value and safety will bring about a step-change in on-farm management. Project 9: Rapid and cost effective ‘on-site’ detection of Cacao swollen-shoot virus ( CSSV ) Partners: Mars Chocolate UK; WCF Ghana-CocoaAction and the University of the West of England ( UWE ) Description: Cocoa beans are the key raw material in chocolate manufacturing. In West Africa, where 70% of the cocoa imported and consumed in the UK is produced, the chocolate industry has identified Cacao Swollen Shoot Disease ( CSSV ) as the major constraint to productivity. A cacao farm with CSSV will suffer declining yields and hence declining farmer income from what is often the only cash crop being grown. To limit the spread of this disease it is essential to develop diagnostic test that can detect pre-symptomatic infection facilitating its prompt control. In this proposal the project will develop a suitable methodology and associated instrumentation to detect CSSV in crude plant extracts. Our approach will employ paper based detection assays suitable for rapid application that can be used in formats that enable unskilled personnel to operate them, thereby enabling their widespread deployment in the field. This will have a significant impact on the economic prospects of cacao farmers in West Africa. Project 10: DryGroAF ( DAF ) Partners: CO2i Ltd; XL Horticulture; Rothamsted Research and World Vision Kenya Description: The DryGro™ process enables the production of crops on arid land - it uses 99% less water than conventional agriculture and has the potential to transform large areas of land which are currently unproductive. The focus of the DAF project is to develop the process to grow biomass to produce animal feed. Agri-Tech Catalyst Round 5 – Industrial Research Project 1: Tools and technology for predicting tomato glasshouse production Partners: Thanet Earth Marketing Limited; Rail Vision Europe Ltd and East Malling Research Description: Year round UK glasshouse production of tomatoes for supermarkets is highly intensive. Although this production is highly controlled it is still difficult to accurately predict picking yields which has an impact on the food supply chain. This inaccuracy requires businesses to continually react to this inefficacy. Over-prediction results in costly imports, whilst under-prediction incurs financial losses from the disposal of surplus fruit. There is considerable potential to reduce these losses and increase the proportion of UK sales by improving the accuracy of yield forecasts. The project will develop an imaging system, TomVision, and mathematical models, PredictTomPro, to more accurately predict weekly yields and deliver significant savings in import costs and waste. Our aim is to predict weekly harvests to 10% of actual, which will generate £30,000/ha extra income per annum for producers and for the developers the anticipated sales of these tools of £1.3 million / £11.3 million / £26 million (UK/EU/Worldwide) after 5 years. Project 2: Bacteriophage management of on-farm salmonella contamination of vine fruits Partners: APS Biocontrol Limited; University of Leicester; Community Foods Limited and Tesco Plc. Description: Salmonella is the most important foodborne pathogen and incidences caused by contaminated food of non-animal origin have been increasing, reflecting rising consumers’ demands for fresh/minimally-processed fruit and vegetables. Crops with an outdoor post-harvest management period are particularly at risk. This project focuses on Salmonella contamination of vine fruits (raisins, sultanas), which are dried outside post-harvest and exposed to animal fouling. Impacts throughout the supply chain are significant, from grower to retailer, with significant recall costs involved. This project will transfer technology from both industry and academia to develop an innovative technology to prevent on-farm Salmonella contamination; ie at source. The solution will be based on safe, naturally-occurring, highly-specific antimicrobial agents (bacteriophage). A business-led consortium will address questions of technology specificity and characterisation, together with deployment and integration into commercial practice. Project 3: Use of stress pre-conditioning, novel sensors and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) to improve crop management, marketable yields, stress resilience and environmental sustainability of raspberry production Partners: BerryGardens Growers Ltd; East Malling Research; Plantworks Ltd; Environmental Monitoring Solutions Ltd and Netafim UK Ltd. Description: UK raspberry production was worth £109 million in 2014, but a further 11KT of berries, worth £59 million, are imported each year. A 20% increase in the 14KT of fruit produced per annum in the UK could be expected to reduce imports by 2.8KT, and raise the value of the UK industry by £15.7 million per annum. However, improved on-farm management of water and fertiliser inputs is needed to optimise productivity; currently, excessive fertigation to substrate-grown raspberry results in vigorous cane growth which makes crop management difficult and harvesting costly. Nutrient leaching also poses a risk to groundwater quality. The project will use novel affinity sensors combined with fuzzy logic to automatically adjust nutrient inputs to match plant demand in real time, reduce fertiliser losses to the environment and improve berry quality. Stress pre-conditioning and AMF will be used to raise marketable yields, improve resource use and acquisition, and increase crop resilience to stresses. Project 4: Integrated control of Leptosphaeria pathogens on UK winter oilseed rape Partners: HL Hutchinson Ltd; DuPont UK Ltd; KWS UK Ltd; Weston Park Farms; SynTech Research UK; F G Taylor & Son (Grove Farm) and University of Hertfordshire Description: Phoma stem canker is a damaging disease of oilseed rape in the UK, leading to yield losses > £100 million per annum despite the use of fungicides. This disease is caused by 2 related pathogens: Leptosphaeria maculans and L. biglobosa. However, current control of the disease focuses only on L. maculans. Recent work showed that L. biglobosa can cause substantial yield losses and that it is less sensitive to triazole fungicides than L. maculans. L. biglobosa is a threat to oilseed rape production in the UK since no methods have been developed to control it. This project will investigate stem canker epidemics caused by L. biglobosa, determine the proportions of L. biglobosa and L. maculans in pathogen populations, screen cultivar resistance against L. biglobosa, determine efficacy of different fungicides for control of L. biglobosa as well as L. maculans. The new knowledge about the pathogens, host resistance and efficacy of fungicides will be used to develop new control strategies that ensure both pathogens are targeted. Project 5: Automato Partners: Sharp Laboratories of Europe Ltd; The Shadow Robot Company Ltd; Stockbridge Technology Centre Research Foundation; Thanet Growers Eight Ltd (Thanet Earth) and Cornerways (as part of British Sugar PLC) Description: The Automato Robot project aims to address the seasonal labour constraints in the UK/European tomato industry and their increasing cost through the development of a cost-effective robotic system that performs on-crop quality and ripeness inspection and then automated harvesting. The project brings together state of the art knowledge of innovative robotic arms, 3D sensing, computer vision and object/pattern recognition as well as expert industry knowledge of commercial greenhouse operations and optimum growing/harvesting practices. This is an industry led project with clear goals for manufacturing and commercialisation post-project following proof of concept demonstration Project 6: Supply chain development in Kenya - UK Agritech to improve rural livelihoods Partners: James Finlay Ltd; Dudutech Limited; Forum for the Future; University of Reading and University of Lincoln Description: The project plan undertakes to develop a new sustainable essential oil market supply chain for large numbers of smallholders in Kenya. The project aims to develop a range of crops to market which would enable the small holders’ production portfolio to be more balanced and robust, and develop into long-term supply programs. The Project is centred on the Fairtrade Fintea Co-operative Union Ltd (12,000 Members) in Kericho Western Kenya and the Dudutech Marigat Project in Baringo County (approx. 7,000 members). It will develop sustainable production systems for 5 oil crops, underpinned by research in sustainable crop production systems and the development of novel QA processes to monitor oil quality in Kenya. Project 7: A whole supply chain approach to control Campylobacter Partners: Moy Park Ltd; Devenish (NI) Ltd; Primer Design Ltd; University of Lincoln; University of Liverpool; Slate Hall Veterinary Practice and St David’s Poultry Team Description: Campylobacter is one of the most serious food borne pathogens, infecting over 280,000 people and costing the UK economy £580 million per annum. This study will conduct the largest known molecular study to track and trace Campylobacter through the supply chain. It will deploy whole genome sequencing on a massive scale to optimise a series of on farm and factory interventions that reduce the contamination of whole chickens with Campylobacter. These interventions include novel animal feeds and factory processes. It will also develop a new qPCR testing kit for Campylobacter. This will be deployed and validated on farm and in factories. The kit will be developed to segregate live from dead cells. It will provide the industry with a real time and accurate rapid enumeration technique. Project 8: Next generation modified atmosphere materials to extend farm storage & reduce waste Partners: Johnson Matthey Plc and Cranfield University Description: The control of respiratory gases within a storage or packaging environment has long been recognised and used to extend the post-harvest quality of fresh fruit and vegetables, and thereby reduce food wastage. The manipulation of respiratory gases can either be controlled or passive, but is rarely responsive. Current modified atmosphere packaging is inflexible as it does not actively and sufficiently react and respond to the changing physiology of the product and the allied gaseous kinetics. This project sets out to develop the next generation of modified atmosphere materials by creating innovative cost effective packaging formats which are able to actively manipulate the internal atmospheric composition within the packaging environment and thereby administer the ideal gaseous conditions at the optimum time during post-harvest life. Project 9: Carcass trait phenotype feedback for genomic selection in sheep Partners: Texel Sheep Society; Anglo Beef Processors ( ABP ) and Scotland’s Rural College ( SRUC ) Description: Only around half of UK-produced lambs meet target conformation and fat quality specifications resulting in waste at the farm and processor levels. This livestock genomics project addresses key issues in primary livestock production by collecting, analysing, and exploiting state-of-the art genomic and new phenotypic data from meat sheep on hard to measure ( HTM ) traits, combining carcass and disease for sustainable sheep improvement. New visual image assessments ( VIA ) of post-mortem lamb carcass quality, and novel, in-line meat hygiene records on individuals will be linked to genome-screening technology to identify superior bloodlines and genomic regions that are more productive and also more resistant to economically-important disease traits. This allows greater productivity to be achieved without compromising health and welfare, and explores the best method to deliver genomic solutions for increases in productivity and efficiency in tandem with improvements in animal health. Project 10: Improving consistency of yields and quality of large-scale and small-holder bean production in Kenya by precision management of soil, water and pathogens  Partners: Provenance Partners Ltd; Vegpro (Kenya) Ltd; East Malling Research; WeatherQuest Ltd and DuduTech Kenya Ltd Description: Delivering consistent supplies of high quality fresh produce is a significant challenge for Kenya’s fresh vegertable growers. A yield of beans range from 5 to 50T/ha and up to 40% of produce is of poor quality due to ineffective irrigation and soil-borne diseases. A 12% increase in average yield and a 20% reduction in waste would raise Class 1 yields by 978T/year; this would generate an extra £3.2 million per year, increase food security and improve soil management practices. The project will: develop irrigation scheduling tools to improve consistency of cropping identify effects of biocontrol agents on soil pathogens and soil microbiome determine effects of soil water availability on incidence and severity soil pathogens and efficacy of biocontrol agents develop integrated control measures to improve Class 1 yields, quality and shelf-life promote benefits of precision irrigation and biocontrol at workshops/on-farm demos assess social and economic impacts of outputs and implement sustainability improvement plans Project 11: Extending the availability and flavour-life of UK apples using innovative photonics Partners: Avalon Produce Ltd; Richard Hochfeld Ltd; Empire World Trade; Chelsea Technologies Group Ltd; Tesco Stores Ltd and Cranfield University Description: The British apple industry is continuously asked by UK retailers to extend availability; this being achieved by implementing ever more sophisticated storage technologies. Whilst this demand is driven by a brand loyalty to domestic production, the industry is increasingly challenged by imports. In order that primary production of UK apples can be fully utilised and be made more competitive, a paradigm shift is needed to improve how apples are stored such that the focus is moved towards ‘flavour-life’ rather than being just driven by firmness and sugar content. The proposed work will develop novel sensor and allied storage interventions which will control ripening whilst maintaining ‘flavour-life’. This offers a route to incremental storage extension to help reduce the reliance on imports and extend the window in which high quality British fruit can be offered. Project 12: Integrating control strategies against soil-borne Rhizoctonia solani in oilseed rape ( ICAROS ) Partners: Syngenta and University of Nottingham Description: Rhizoctonia solani is an aggressive soil-borne pathogen of oilseed rape ( OSR ) and canola worldwide. It is implicated in the yield decline of the crop when grown with increased frequency in field rotations. Presently there are no disease resistant varieties hence the control of the disease relies on the use of chemical seed treatment. The key objectives of this project are to identify novel resistance traits and loci to R. solani which can be utilised in crop breeding and effective seed treatments that can be registered against the pathogen in OSR and made commercially available to UK growers. The ultimate output of this multidisciplinary project will be the first integrated guidelines for the control R. solani incorporating targeted seed treatments and varietal resistance for improved disease management and protection of OSR yield. Agri-Tech Catalyst Round 5 – Late stage Project 1: Vydrofarm – promoting sustainable food production via automated commercial indoor farms Participant: Hydrogarden Wholesale Supplies Ltd Description: VydroFarm is a fully automated commercial vertical hydroponics indoor system adapted for both cold and hot/humid climates. It incorporates a set of proprietary technologies and knowledge – including special LED lights, specific nutrient regime, and biodegradable growing media – to deliver 30% more crop yield, compared to existing growing technologies, and reducing by half the normal growing period. Vydrofarm delivers significant impact on crop production, making it feasible to grow nutritionally rich microgreens and medicinal herbs in urban and peri-areas, particularly rehabilitating redundant buildings, brownfields sites and high-polluted land. It also improves food security and increases the supply of nutritious and better quality produce to a larger amount of population. Project 2: Rubber track undercarriage systems for controlled traffic farming Participant: Sly Agri Ltd Description: Rubber track undercarriage systems for controlled traffic farming."

This change simplifies our survey processes and brings our slaughter survey in line with our milk surveys which are already run on a calendar month basis, it also removes the need for the 53 week year (which would have to be 2016). Since the end of weekly slaughter survey several years ago, there is no legislative requirement for weekly data, so since then we have derived the average weekly throughput from the monthly survey data. January 2016 data will include the last week of December 2015 and therefore be classed as a 5 week month. From 1st February 2016 onwards the statistics will be based on calendar months.

Rights of way circular (1/09)  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs The information contained in this circular is applicable only within England. This circular replaces previous advice and guidance in circulars: 1/08, 2/93, 3/93, 17/90, 18/90, 32/81, which are now no longer valid. In many areas, rights of way help to boost tourism and contribute to rural economies. They can also provide a convenient means of travelling, particularly for short journeys, in both rural and urban areas. They are important in the daily lives of many people who use them for fresh air and exercise on bicycle, on foot, on horseback or in a horse-drawn vehicle, to walk the dog, to improve their fitness, or to visit local shops and other facilities. Local authorities should regard public rights of way as an integral part of the complex of recreational and transport facilities within their area. This advice and guidance sets out Defra’s policy on public rights of way and its view of the law. It does not take the place of the legislation, but seeks to give an overview of it within a policy context."

/government/news/support-for-uk-salad-growers-affected-by-e-coli-scare,"Scheme guidance and all forms are available on the RPA website. Support for UK salad growers affected by e.coli scare  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs UK growers must act quickly to apply for support under the new EU scheme to compensate them following the market disruption caused by the German e.coli outbreak and the ongoing Russian trade ban. The scheme, worth €210 million across the EU, is open to growers of tomatoes, lettuce, endives, cucumbers, sweet peppers and courgettes and provides aid for growers whose produce has been withdrawn from sale or has not been harvested. Agriculture Minister Jim Paice said: “British salad growers are facing a tough time through no fault of their own and I urge those affected to act quickly. This funding is only available for a very limited time and it’s vital that UK producers don’t miss out.” The scheme applies to products withdrawn from sale between 18 and 30 June 2011. The deadline for applications is 6pm on Thursday 30 June 2011. RPA will provide information about the quantities of products withdrawn in the UK to the European Commission on 18 July 2011. The Commission will then use this information to determine whether the total number of applications fall within the financial limit set for these measures. Any products notified for withdrawal will be subject to checks, which may be unannounced. Checks will include ensuring marketing standards are met, weighing and sampling, and will cover produce in the field as well as harvested produce. Growers will need to retain produce for inspection until 6pm of the next working day following notification, unless otherwise advised by RPA. Notes Scheme guidance and all forms are available on the RPA website at rpa.defra.gov.uk . Lines are open 8.30am to 5pm Monday to Friday. For queries contact RPA on 0845 053 9103 or visit the website or email F&VWithdrawals@rpa.gsi.gov.uk . Growers wanting to notify their wish to withdraw products, need to submit a form HOR7A, Application for Withdrawals, which is available on the RPA website at rpa.defra.gov.uk . Anyone without web access can obtain copies of the form from RPA by fax to 0191 226 1081. Anyone wishing to receive payment from this scheme will need to be registered with RPA. Those not registered with RPA, and not a member of one of the recognised Producer Organisations, will need to register as a trader, be allocated a trader registration number and provide bank details for the payments. To register with RPA call 0845 053 9103. Growers can apply under this scheme (using form HOR7A) even though they are not registered as they can still notify RPA and action withdrawals while in the process of registering. If necessary, to ensure the financial limit is not exceeded across the EU, the Commission will determine an allocation coefficient to reduce the total aid, on a pro rata basis. Rates of aid to be applied in the UK, the maximum amounts of additional Union support for market withdrawals as referred to in Article 4(5) of Regulation 585/2011, are: Product Maximum support (EURO/100 kg) Tomatoes 33.2 Lettuce  and curled-leaved and broad-leaved endives 38.9 Cucumbers 24.0 Sweet peppers 44.4 Courgettes 29.6"
/government/news/benyon-calls-for-firm-action-against-archaic-trade-in-rhino-horn,"Poaching is one of the main threats to the survival of the species. Benyon calls for firm action against ‘archaic’ trade in rhino horn  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs The international community must take urgent action to tackle the alarming rise in the trade of rhino horn before the species is wiped out, Natural Environment Minister Richard Benyon said today. The call came as the UK Government submitted proposals at a Convention on the International Trade of Endangered Species (CITES) meeting for all countries to clamp down on illegal sales of rhino horn and tighten restrictions on the trade in rhino products. The trade in rhino horn has been fuelled in part by unsubstantiated claims that it can cure cancer or reverse the effects of a stroke and an increase in its black market value. Rhino horn is now reported to be worth more than £50,000 per kilo - more profitable than diamonds, gold, heroin and cocaine. Three out of the five species of rhinoceros are critically endangered. Environment Minister Richard Benyon said: “This trade in rhino horn belongs in the Victorian era, along with the idea that it can cure cancer or reverse a stroke. Rising demand based on these false claims has brought a majestic species to its knees while criminals and snake-oil salesmen line their pockets. “We need to act now if we want the rhino to survive, and we need a global effort to ensure the strongest possible restrictions are placed on this archaic, cruel and completely unnecessary trade.” In September 2010, following a surge in the number and value of horns being exported from the UK, Defra increased restrictions on their sale. Since then the Government has been working with the European Union to ensure that all Member States take the same approach. The European Commission issued a guidance note to all Member States in February this year urging the adoption of stricter trade controls. As one of 16 members of the CITES Standing Committee, the UK today called on all countries to introduce EU-style measures, to clarify that there is no scientific proof that rhino horn is of benefit to cancer and stroke victims, and to establish a working group that can identify measures to ensure the long-term survival of the species in the wild. The UK will also support a workshop in South Africa in September to help develop better cooperation between countries where rhinos are poached and countries where their horns are sold. The Standing Committee, which meets annually, will also consider the current status of a range of other species this week such as elephants, tigers, great apes, snakes, sturgeon and mahogany. The UK will be seeking a precautionary approach for the benefit of all species, and in particular calling for future sales of legally sourced ivory - designed to undermine the illegal ivory market - to be stopped unless it can be clearly shown that such sales reduce poaching levels. Notes CITES is the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, an international agreement between governments that came into force in 1975. Under this agreement the import, export and use for commercial gain of certain species is strictly controlled and requires a CITES permit. The UK proposal submitted to the Standing Committee can be found here: http://www.cites.org/eng/com/sc/61/E61-45-02.pdf . All species of rhinoceros (except certain populations of southern white rhino) are listed on Appendix I of CITES and Annex A of the EC Regulations implementing CITES in the EU, affording rhinos the highest level of protection. Poaching is one of the main threats to the survival of the species. Last year in South Africa alone over 330 rhinos were poached out of a global population of 17,000 white rhino and around 4000 black rhino. Around 2000 Indian rhinoceros survive in the wild along with even smaller numbers of Javan and Sumatran rhinoceroses. Next month’s planned South Africa workshop on the rhino horn trade will also be supported by South Africa, the United States and TRAFFIC International."
/government/news/common-weed-has-hidden-superpowers,"A plant that used to be killed as a weed could soon be farmed for essential fatty acids. Common weed has hidden superpowers  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Innovative research sponsored by Defra shows that Corn Gromwell, rich in omega-3, could potentially be grown commercially in the UK for the first time. Corn Gromwell is native to Europe, North Africa and across Siberia and Western Asia and has also been introduced into the USA. Until recently it was best known a common weed in spring cereal crops. Agriculture Minister Jim Paice said: “Turning a common weed into a valuable crop is a great example of the innovation that our farming industry is so good at. This research is part of our wider support to help farmers under pressure to diversify and find new markets.” Essential fatty acids are needed to support our nervous, cardiovascular and immune systems. They can’t be made in the body so have to come from our diets. Corn Gromwell contains stearidonic acid (SDA), an omega-3 fatty acid. It will have the potential to be marketed as a supplement or included as an ingredient in foods. The research carried out by the National Institute of Agricultural Botany (NIAB TAG), in collaboration with Technology Crops Limited, looked at whether Corn Gromwell (Buglossoides arvensis) could be grown commercially. The trials found that the crop: needs few inputs and a low amount of fertiliser; doesn’t suffer from many pests or diseases and isn’t palatable to pigeons or rabbits; and has a higher yield and is easier to harvest than the only commercial non-GM plant source of SDA, Echium. Notes The oil produced from Corn Gromwell is a source of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) stearidonic acid (SDA). There is some evidence that SDA is converted to the n-3 PUFA eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), which is found in oily fish. Plant sources rich in SDA do not replace fish as the main source of the long chain PUFAs EPA and DHA. This project was sponsored by Defra under the Sustainable Arable LINK programme, which supports collaboration between industry and academia for high quality pre-commercial research that furthers the sustainable development of the arable sector. The programme is closed to new projects, as Government support for such collaborative research is now provided through the Sustainable Agriculture and Food Innovation Platform. Further information on the project can be found at http://www.niab.com/pages/id/319/Corn_Gromwell ."
/government/news/john-whitehead-obe-appointed-interim-chair-of-seafish,"The Government has today announced the appointment of John Whitehead OBE as interim Chair of Seafish. John Whitehead OBE appointed interim chair of Seafish  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Mr Whitehead is currently the Deputy Chairman of the Seafish board. He will take on a new, more hands on role as interim Chair to lead Seafish through the planned Supreme Court appeal against a previous ruling on the legality of raising levy on imported fish and fish products. Mr Whitehead replaces Charles Howeson who has played a major role in guiding Seafish through the current legal challenge facing the organisation and has given his time and expertise to enable Seafish to adapt to the changing circumstances it faces. Mr Howeson currently has a number of other important public service roles which also call heavily on his time. He has reluctantly decided that having laid the groundwork for Seafish’s legal response he is not in a position to extend his service without detriment to his other public duties. The Government has accepted Mr Howeson’s decision with regret but fully respects his reasons, and is extremely grateful for the service he has given both to Seafish and the wider seafood industry over the last three challenging years. Government is continuing to provide every support to Seafish during this critical period and warmly welcomes John Whitehead’s agreement to accept the interim Chairmanship of the Seafish Board. Notes John Whitehead OBE biography John Whitehead currently Deputy Chair of Seafish, has spent all his working life in the food industry, latterly as the Managing Director of Top Hat Holdings Limited, Dundee based producers of convenience food for many of the major multiple retailers and food service chains. He has considerable experience in public sector organisations having previously served as a Commissioner of the Meat and Livestock Commission and a Member of the Council of Food from Britain. He is Chairman of the Certification Council of Scottish Food Quality Certification Ltd and Senior Independent Director of Improve, the Sector Skills Council for the food and drink industry. He serves as a non executive Director with Strathmore Foods Ltd and Glycomar Ltd. In 2004 he was awarded an OBE for services to the agri food industry. Educated at Keswick School and the Royal Agricultural College, he was admitted as a Fellow of the Institute of Horticulture in 1986."

/government/news/movement-restrictions-on-older-cattle-introduced,"The restrictions are being placed on cattle born or reared in the UK before 1 August 1996. Movement restrictions on older cattle introduced  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Cattle born or reared in the UK before 1 August 1996 have had new movement restrictions placed on them as an extra precaution against meat from these older cattle entering the food chain. The restrictions are being placed on cattle born or reared in the UK before 1 August 1996 following a Government investigation into whether any illegal trade in these cattle has occurred. Defra has written to the 18,000 keepers with animals of this age to inform them of the new measures. Controls to prevent these animals from entering the food chain are already strong. It is illegal to slaughter pre-1996 animals for food, and specified risk material (SRM) such as brain and spinal cord is removed from all cattle after slaughter. In addition, any cattle aged over 48 months are tested for BSE after slaughter and only those that test negative are allowed into the food chain. Agriculture Minister Jim Paice said: “I regret that due to what appears to be illegal activity by a few individuals, this has been necessary. The industry has worked hard over the years to ensure British beef regained the good reputation it deserves, both at home and abroad.   “We want to maintain this reputation, so it’s sensible to introduce this extra safeguard. It shouldn’t have much impact on most cattle keepers, but it will give us additional confidence that these animals don’t enter the food chain.” Relevant livestock keepers are being informed that no cattle born or reared in the UK before August 1996 will be allowed to move from their holdings without an individual movement licence, and no licences will be granted to move these cattle to markets or through dealers. In practice, this should affect a relatively small number of owners. Notes: As at 1 January 2011 there were around 53,000 cattle that were born or reared in the UK before August 1996 - around 34,000 in England, 11,000 in Scotland and nearly 8000 in Wales - on 18,190 holdings. The total cattle population in Great Britain is around 9 million.  Fewer than 1 per cent of holdings have more than 20 cattle that fall into this category. The number of pre-August 96 cattle is declining steadily in line with expectations. The removal of specified risk material (SRM) such as brain and spinal cord is the key food safety measure against BSE. In the unlikely event that a cow infected with BSE is slaughtered for food, its SRM would have been removed, thereby removing almost all of the risk. In addition, any cattle aged over 48 months are tested for BSE after slaughter."

The latest improvements will: enable the HMI to make random inspections of just one per cent of goods subject to the General Marketing Standard (GMS) passing through the HMI PEACH system; allow eligible firms to self certify their imports for Customs clearance of Specific Marketing Standards (SMS) goods through the Approved Trader Status scheme (ATS); improve risk selection of produce for inspection control; and use clearer and more informative forms. Under EU rules, products covered by the General Marketing Standard (GMS) must be subject to a risk-assessed inspection. To minimise the impact on industry, the HMI will check one per cent of all GMS imports, using a system that targets companies with poorer compliance records. Importers will be informed if their goods are selected for random inspection when they apply for each consignment. These initiatives follow consultation and collaboration with fruit and vegetable importers who will benefit from a simplified and more rational system. Notes Further information, including the criteria and application process for the Approved Trader Status scheme is available on the HMI pages of the RPA Website at www.rpa.gov.uk References to EC marketing regulations relate to Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1580/2007 as amended. The new system will allow for a one per cent selection of produce by the HMRC CHIEF system, this will be reviewed periodically and the use of other rates considered. If necessary some goods from particular countries or from particular importers or particular products may be subject to a higher rate of check. However, every effort will be made to work with industry to rectify any problems before considering other rates. Clear guidance for importers whose goods are selected for random inspection will be provided by the HMRC CHIEF system and more information will be available through the HMI Helpdesk on 0845 607 3224. Criteria for the Approved Trader Status (ATS) scheme include: a record of good compliance with the regulations; training in place for their staff; records of inspections having been carried out on their goods showing appropriate corrective action; and suitable facilities. Status will be granted for three years only, ATS companies will be subject to regular checks and audits and status can be withdrawn should they subsequently fail to meet all criteria. Enforcement of these regulations is delivered in England and Wales by the Horticultural Marketing Inspectorate (HMI), a branch of the Rural Payments Agency Inspectorate (RPAi)."
/government/news/pip-pip-hooray-its-national-cherry-day,"Saturday 17 July is National Cherry Day and there’s something to celebrate as British cherry orchards begin to grow again.  Pip, pip hooray, it's National Cherry Day  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs During the 20th century Britain lost 90 per cent of our cherry orchards. But between 2003 and 2008 they increased by 17 per cent. However, despite the good news, the UK still imports around 95 per cent of our cherries. Food and Farming Minister, Jim Paice said: “The taste of fresh cherries is as much a part of summer as the smell of freshly cut grass or a trip to the seaside. The British fruit industry is a vital part of our rural economy so what better excuse to tuck into some delicious and healthy British cherries on National Cherry Day.” Cherries have been part of British culture for thousands of years but most of the cherries we see in the shops now are from Spain, Turkey and the USA. Here in the UK we grow juicy and flavoursome cherries and even export them to the Republic of Ireland. This weekend marks the peak in the British cherry harvest, so why not pick your own or look out for them in farm shops, greengrocers and some supermarkets Top Ten cherry facts Cherries belong to the plant genus Prunus, which also includes plums, peaches, apricots and almonds. Most of the cherries that we eat come from either the wild cherry (Prunus avium) or the sour cherry (Prunus cerasus). Wild cherry and sour cherry are thought to have originally come from Asia Minor (now Turkey). The Greek writer Theophrastus (c. 371 - c. 287 BC) mentions them in Historia Plantarum (History of Plants). They were first brought to Britain by the Romans but the cherry orchards of Kent are claimed to have been created directly on the orders of Henry VIII after he tasted the fruit in Flanders. Are cherries the next super food? Like other red berries, cherries contain the red pigment anthocyanins and there are claims that this can reduce pain and inflammation in rats. Researchers are also investigating the possibility that tart cherry powder eaten by rats as part of a high-fat diet might reduce the amount of weight gain and body fat and reduce levels of cholesterol. Cherry orchards also support other plants and animals. Cherry trees host mistletoe and the blossom and fruit provide nourishment for many birds and insects. The National Fruit Collection, held at Brogdale Farm is home to more than 300 varieties of cherry. They range in colour from bright scarlet to nearly black. Cherry stones contain amygdalin, which becomes cyanide when metabolised by the body. At the start of the 20th Century there were more than 5,000 ha of cherry orchards in Kent. By the end of the century this was reduced to less than 600 ha. Girls have been predicting who they’ll marry using the cherry stone counting rhyme ‘Tinker, tailor, soldier, sailor’ for centuries. The first written record with these professions grouped together dates from 1695. Before the invention of the hot water bottle, heated cherry stones were placed in pans to warm up beds on cold winter nights. Notes National Cherry Day was started in 2008 as part of CherryAid, a campaign to save the British cherry."
/government/news/uk-secures-international-agreement-to-combat-illegal-rhino-trade,"Three out of the five species of rhinoceros are critically endangered. UK secures international agreement to combat illegal rhino trade  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs The UK has united the international community to clamp down on the illegal trade in rhino horn and fight the archaic myths that fuel the continued demand for rhino horn products. Britain’s leadership at the latest CITES (Convention for International Trade in Endangered Species) in Geneva will mean countries and conservation groups across the world will work together by sharing intelligence, policing tactics and public awareness campaigns against the illegal trade which is now more profitable than drug smuggling. Environment Secretary Caroline Spelman said: “Criminals trading in rhino horn have lined their pockets while bringing this magnificent animal to the brink of extinction.  But their days are now numbered. “We will be leading global action to clamp down on this cruel and archaic trade, and to dispel the myths peddled to vulnerable people that drive demand for rhino products.” The UK will lead the new steering group providing the evidence which will dispel unproven beliefs that rhino horn can prevent a range of diseases such as cancer, or help in the treatment of strokes.  The group will also bring in further enforcement measures needed to prevent and control the illegal trade to ensure the long-term survival of the species. Three out of the five species of rhinoceros are critically endangered. Recent rumours have falsely suggested that that rhino horn can cure cancer and help in the treatment of stokes, fuelling demand around the world to supply markets in Asia. This has seen an increase in demand and more animals are now being poached and more horns stolen from private collections, museums and auction houses. Rhino horn is now reported to be worth more than £50,000 per kilo - more profitable than diamonds, gold, heroin or cocaine. In September 2010, following a surge in the number and value of horns being exported from the UK, Defra increased restrictions on their sale. Since then, Britain has been working with the European Union to ensure that all Member States take the same approach. The UK will also support a workshop in South Africa in September to help develop better cooperation between countries where rhinos are poached and countries where their horns are sold. Steering group members will include the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda, USA, UK, South Africa, India, Kenya, Zimbabwe, Namibia, China, IUCN, WWF, TRAFFIC, SSN and the Safari Club. Notes CITES is the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, an international agreement between governments that came into force in 1975. Under this agreement the import, export and use for commercial gain of certain species is strictly controlled and requires a CITES permit. All species of rhinoceros (except certain populations of southern white rhino) are listed on Appendix I of CITES and Annex A of the EC Regulations implementing CITES in the EU, affording rhinos the highest level of protection. Poaching is one of the main threats to the survival of the species. Last year in South Africa alone over 330 rhinos were poached out of a global population of 17,000 white rhino and around 4000 black rhino. Around 2000 Indian rhinoceros survive in the wild along with even smaller numbers of Javan and Sumatran rhinoceroses. Next month’s planned South Africa workshop on the rhino horn trade will also be supported by South Africa, the United States and TRAFFIC International."
/government/news/world-rhino-day-message-from-environment-minister-richard-benyon,"Governments and conservation groups need to work more closely together to help combat the illegal trade in rhino horn, Environment Minister Richard Benyon said today. World Rhino Day message from Environment Minister Richard Benyon  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Speaking on World Rhino Day, at a time when three out of the five species of rhinoceros are critically endangered, Mr Benyon said that sharing intelligence on poachers and rhino horn traders and discussing tactics on policing were important elements in the fight to protect rhinos. He added that public understanding about the illegal trade in rhino horn needed to be much higher than it is at the moment. “When you consider the horrifying news that more than 300 rhinos were killed by poachers in South Africa last year, it shows you how much work still needs to be done,” Mr Benyon said. “World Rhino Day gives us all an opportunity to step back and consider what we can do to protect rhinos, and I’m proud to say that the UK is leading the way internationally to make sure there is global action on this issue. Future generations wouldn’t forgive us if we allowed these magnificent animals to be wiped out by the illegal and barbaric trade in rhino horn. “One of the saddest aspects of all of this is that rhinos are being slaughtered because of a myth. People need to realize that there are absolutely no medical benefits to be gained from rhino horn - it’s made of the same stuff as fingernails and toenails - and the more we can get this message out and reduce the demand for rhino products the nearer we will be to getting rhinos off the endangered species list.” Last month Britain united the international community against the illegal trade in rhino horn, setting up and leading a new CITES (Convention for International Trade in Endangered Species) steering group to provide evidence against rhino horn as a medicine and bringing in further enforcement measures to prevent and control illegal trade."

/government/news/1-3-million-government-pledge-to-protect-our-most-endangered-species,"This new fund cements the UK's commitment to leading the way in international conservation. £1.3 million Government pledge to protect our most endangered species  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs £1.3 million is being invested in a range of projects dedicated to protecting some of the world’s most endangered and best-loved species, Environment Minister Richard Benyon announced today. From supporting efforts to stamp out the barbaric trade in rhino horn to preserving habitats for fast-disappearing wild tigers, this new fund cements the UK’s commitment to leading the way in international conservation. Environment Minister Richard Benyon said: “Global action must be taken before these species are wiped out for good. Tigers, rhinos, elephants and apes are much loved animals that some of us take for granted. Yet many are suffering horrific deaths at the hands of poachers and traffickers or because their habitats are being destroyed.  “It would be a travesty if these animals were allowed to disappear forever, which is why the UK Government is committed to leading the way in supporting such vital international conservation. “We need to stop these animals disappearing forever and the projects receiving funding today are working to do just that, which is why I am so pleased to be able to support them.” Defra has consistently supported efforts to protect tigers and rhinos in the wild, earlier this year pledging over a quarter of a million pounds to a range of conservation projects. This latest funding will go towards efforts to clamp down on the international trade in endangered species and to the Global Tiger Recovery Plan, which is working to double the number of the animals in the wild by 2022.  The £1.3 million fund will contribute to vital projects across the world to help animals that are on the brink of extinction have a chance of survival.  A breakdown of the projects receiving funding are:  £312k - Global Tiger Recovery Programme - a global programme, running until 2022, being coordinated by the World Bank; £312k - Contribution to the Nagoya Protocol Implementation £200k - UK - Brazil workshop to develop biodiversity actions plans for countries across the world; £120k - Zoological Society of London - Progressing REDD+ as a sustainable funding mechanism for tiger conservation in the Berbak National Park; £100k - ABS Collaborative initiative with Colombia - to pursue an initiative on biodiversity with the Colombians; £100k - The Great Apes Survival Project - shaping a new strategy for protecting this vulnerable species; £50k - IUCN African elephant (AfESG) specialist group - AfESG work with African states on elephant conservation including the fight against poaching and illegal trade; £50k - IUCN African rhino (AfRSG) specialist group.  AfRSG work with African states on rhino conservation; £40K - To strengthen Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) implementation via the International Consortium for Combating Wildlife Crime; £25k - Flagship Species Fund - an additional contribution to the £100k already given to Fauna and Flora International to support small-scale biodiversity projects around the world; £14k - Rhino conservation - to a number of vital rhino conservation missions; £14k - Ivory action plan verification missions - to combat the illegal trade in ivory; and £10k - Zoological Society of London - fire fighting in Berbak National Park, to help safeguard a key tiger habitat."
/government/news/days-are-numbered-for-criminals-illegally-trading-rhino-horn,"The temporary suspension of trade in 'artistic items' will mean nearly all future applications for the export of rhino horn will be refused. Days are numbered for criminals illegally trading rhino horn  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Ongoing pressure from the UK for tougher controls to tackle the illegal trade in rhino horn has proved successful, as the European Commission announced further restrictions on the export of rhino horn across the EU today. The temporary suspension of trade in ‘artistic items’ will mean nearly all future applications for the export of rhino horn will be refused. Licenses will only be granted if buyers and sellers meet stringent criteria.  We do not expect the suspension to be lifted until it is successful in reducing poaching and demand.    Environment Minister Richard Benyon said: “These magnificent animals are on the brink of extinction, suffering horrific deaths at the hands of greedy poachers.  We’ve been pushing for firmer restrictions to put an end to this cruel trade in the UK, and so I am really pleased to see this important step being taken.  “But of course our efforts will not stop there. We will continue to lead the way internationally to ensure the rhino has a chance of survival.”   Evidence suggests that criminal groups are targeting rhino horns in all their forms, including ‘artistic items’, such as carved ivory, and re-selling it on the black market.  In September 2010, following a surge in the number and value of horns being exported from the UK, Defra increased restrictions on their sale.  Since then, the UK has been working with the European Union to ensure that all Member States take the same approach. From today, all applications to re-export products made from rhino horn will no longer be granted unless they meet at least one of the following criteria: The item is part of a genuine exchange between reputable institutions (i.e. museums); The item is an heirloom moving as part of a family relocation; or The item is part of a bone fide research project. Three out of the five species of rhinoceros are critically endangered, with only around 28,000 remaining in the wild.  The UK will continue to work with countries where rhinos are poached and countries where their horns are sold, on enforcement and educational measures and look at ways to improve cooperation. Notes The revised guidance can be found on the European Commission’s website The European Union plan to review this Guidance at the end of the year. All species of rhinoceros (except certain populations of southern white rhino) are listed on Appendix I of CITES and Annex A of the EC Regulations implementing CITES in the EU, affording rhinos the highest level of protection. Poaching is one of the main threats to the survival of the species. The UK is chairing a rhino working group to discuss and identify measures that could be taken by CITES Parties to reduce the impact of illegal trade on the conservation of rhinoceroses and to enhance existing controls on trade in rhinoceros horn products."
/government/news/nation-s-biggest-inland-flood-defence-opened-in-nottingham,"Owen Paterson unveils a plaque to mark the opening of the Nottingham flood defence scheme. Nation’s biggest inland flood defence opened in Nottingham  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs A new £45 million flood defence, which will protect more inland properties than any other in England, was opened today in Nottingham by Environment Secretary Owen Paterson. Stretching along a 27 kilometre stretch of the River Trent, from Sawley to Colwick, the flood defence will protect 16,000 homes and businesses, as well as roads and factories at the heart of the communities. The flood defence has been funded by Defra and built by the Environment Agency, working closely with the local community, Nottingham City Council, Natural England and other local partners. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson said: “This is a great example of the Government’s commitment to improve flood defences.  Our investment here will bring much relief to 16,000 homes and businesses - more than any other inland flood defence in the country. “We’re doing all we can to protect people from the devastating effects of flooding and now expect to beat our goal to better protect 145,000 households across the country by March 2015.” Chairman of the Environment Agency, Lord Chris Smith said: “Nottingham has a long history of flooding so the completion of this scheme will bring much needed relief to the people who live and work along the Trent. Protecting 16,000 properties along 27 kilometres of the Trent, the Nottingham left bank scheme is also the largest inland flood scheme that Environment Agency has ever completed. In the four years to 2015 the Environment Agency will have reduced the flood risk to over 145,000 households across England.” Nottingham has a history of flooding dating back to 1683. The flooding that took place in 1947 affected 28 miles of road, 3,000 properties and 86 factories in the city centre. Nottingham flood alleviation scheme The Nottingham Left Bank Scheme is the biggest individual inland flood defence scheme ever built in terms of properties protected. The defences cover the following areas: Sawley and Trent Meadows - the defences reduce the flood risk to large areas of Long Eaton. The work included the raising and rebuilding of approximately 1.8km of flood embankment, constructing about 250m of new flood wall, raising the B6540 at Sawley to cross over the defences and replacing the flood gate across the Erewash canal. Beeston and Rylands - the work included the raising of about 700m of existing flood wall, building about 200m of new flood wall, rebuilding about 900m of flood embankment and the raising of the flood gate on the Beeston canal. Attenborough - the work created 2.5km of new flood wall between the Attenborough Nature Reserve and the railway line and raised the road at Barton Lane. New defences extend around Attenborough village protecting it for the first time. The nature reserve is a Site of Special Scientific Interest and the work required special care to minimise the effect on the environment. Meadows - the defences extend through the Victoria Embankment Park for a length of about 1.8km.  The work had to take into account listed structures such as the War Memorial and the bandstand as well as ensuring that events such as the Riverside Festival and the Robin Hood marathon could continue during and after the scheme. Colwick - about 2.5km of defences have been raised and strengthened including both embankments and flood walls."

The disease causes leaf loss and has already killed trees in England, Scotland and parts of mainland Europe. The infected trees in the UK had come from nurseries in  Europe or had been in contact with imported ash trees. A ban would also mean trees from infected areas would not be able to be moved to other locations. Owen Paterson said: “This disease could have a devastating impact on our native ash trees so we need to take action  to stop it. We are working towards a ban on imports, and looking to impose movement restrictions on trees from infected areas. “Work is already underway to prevent the disease spreading and trade bodies have been encouraging their members to impose voluntary import bans. “By taking decisive action we can prevent our ash trees from suffering the same fate as elm trees did in the 1970s.” All infected trees are being destroyed and the Plant Health Authority are on high alert across the country. Ash trees in the vicinity of infected sites are also being monitored by the Plant Health Authority to ensure early detection of the disease. Suspected cases of the disease should be reported to the Forestry Commission so that appropriate action can be taken to prevent the disease from spreading. A consultation on managing the threat to the UK’s ash trees is due to end on 26 October. A ban could then come into force before the main planting season gets underway in mid November. The Government will work with the industry and those that grow or trade in ash plants to minimise the impact a ban will have on their businesses.

The disease, caused by the fungus Chalara fraxinea, leads to leaf loss and has already affected trees in England and Scotland, and killed trees in parts of mainland Europe.  A rapid eight week consultation was launched which has shown that there is strong support for an import ban. The ban is being put in place before the main planting season gets underway in late November.  Movement restrictions will also be imposed, so that trees from infected areas will not be able to be moved to other locations within the UK. Announcing his decision on a visit to Cannock Chase, Staffordshire, Owen Paterson said: “This is a very serious disease that demands action to stop its spread.  I have ordered both an import ban and movement restrictions on trees from infected areas.  This comes into force immediately. “Work is already underway to tackle the disease. Plant Health Authorities have been monitoring trees in infected areas to ensure early detection and trade bodies have been encouraging their members to impose voluntary import bans.  By working together we can protect our native trees from this devastating disease.” The Plant Health Authorities will remain on high alert across the country and will continue to look for signs of Chalara, ensuring infected trees are dealt with effectively. Suspected cases of the disease should be reported to the Forestry Commission or Fera so that appropriate action can be taken to prevent the disease from spreading.

/government/news/government-action-on-ash-tree-disease-chalara,"Hundreds of staff members from government agencies will be out checking sites across the UK for signs of the tree disease Chalara ash dieback… Government action on ash tree disease Chalara  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Hundreds of staff members from government agencies will be out checking sites across the UK for signs of the tree disease Chalara ash dieback this weekend. It’s one of several actions to emerge from a meeting of the Government’s emergency committee COBR, which Environment Secretary Owen Paterson chaired this morning. Plant health experts are undertaking an urgent survey of a thousand sites which have had saplings from nurseries where Chalara has found to be present. They are also prioritising the examination of around 2500 blocks of land, each 10 kilometres square, where mature ash trees are known to be present, in order to seek out traces of the disease in our established trees. These experts will be backed up by volunteers from organisations such as the Woodland Trust, National Parks and the National Trust as well as the CLA who have urged their members to use Forestry Commission guidance to check their ash trees for traces of the disease over this weekend. The ash tree is a native British species of tree, providing around five percent of woodland cover. Chalara is a serious disease that has affected a high proportion of ash trees in northern Europe and which was confirmed as present in the UK in March. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson said: “The fact that we had a COBR meeting shows how seriously the Government is taking the threat of this disease. We’re co-ordinating work across all of the main Government departments and their agencies, as well as the devolved administrations, to make sure we’re all doing everything we can to control the disease. “The urgent work that will happen this weekend will give us a much better picture of where the disease is; we can then target our efforts in those areas. I’ll be sharing the results of these initial surveys with colleagues across the industry at a Plant Health Summit next week where we’ll be working together on the next steps. “The action we are taking now builds on the crucial work earlier in the year when the disease was first identified here back in March in a nursery. We’ve been tracking down affected trees and destroying them, and last week I banned imports of ash trees and imposed movement controls ahead of the planting season. We’ve taken the right action at the right time in order to tackle this disease.” A task force of staff is also being set up, pulling staff from Defra, Fera, Forestry Commission, Natural England and the Environment Agency to be deployed in surveying for Chalara. The COBR meeting was also updated on the state of the disease. Cases of Chalara are still being discovered in East Anglia in mature trees. So far there are 41 confirmed sites where the disease is present. These are 13 nurseries, 16 recent planting sites and 12 woodland sites. Action taken over the summer to identify areas where the disease might have been present has resulted in 100,000 saplings being destroyed to prevent the spread of the disease. Ian Boyd, Chief Scientific Advisor to Defra, gave an account of the latest findings on the disease. He said: “We’re dealing with a new disease for the UK and the science community is pulling together to provide as much information as it’s emerging to allow us to take action as quickly as possible. “The evidence of Chalara present in mature trees in East Anglia points to the disease being present for a number of years and unfortunately we are likely to discover it in other mature woodland, particularly in coastal areas. That’s why this survey is so important as the more evidence we can compile, the better we are equipped to tackle it in the best way possible.” Government scientists set out the most up-to-date understanding of the disease. Their assessment agreed with the earlier Pest Risk Analysis carried out in August and concluded that: the spores are unlikely to survive for more than a few days; spore dispersal on the wind is possible from mainland Europe; trees need a high dose of spores to become infected; the spores are produced from infected dead leaves during the months of June to September; there is a low probability of dispersal on clothing or animals and birds; the disease will attack any species of ash; the disease becomes obvious in trees within months rather than years; wood products would not spread the disease if treated properly; once infected, trees can’t be cured; and not all trees die of the infection, and some are likely to have genetic resistance. Government scientists are working with their counterparts in other countries to learn from existing and emerging research and practical experience in combating the disease in countries which have had it for longer than the UK. Government scientific experts are also approaching companies with proposed treatment solutions for Chalara to rapidly evaluate their research to see if they have potential for further testing and development."

Ash disease found in Kent and Essex  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs The tree disease Chalara, also known as ash dieback, has been confirmed in forests and woodland in Kent and Essex after an urgent survey to seek out traces of the disease in Britain’s established woodlands. The confirmation of Chalara in Kent and Essex does not mean the disease has spread since the first case in woodland was detected in East Anglia. It is believed that the disease in East Anglia may have been present for a number of years, and is likely to have been transmitted by wind from the mainland Europe. The same is likely to be true for the cases in Kent and Essex. Of the thousand sites initially surveyed, plant health experts are undertaking an urgent check of 220 prioritised sites which have had saplings from nurseries where Chalara was found to be present. They are also prioritising the examination of around 2500 blocks of land, each 10 kilometres square, where mature ash trees are known to be present in order to seek out traces of the disease in our established trees. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson said: “We’re doing everything we can to identify where the disease is so that we can focus our efforts on those areas. Once we had the scientific advice that the disease in mature trees had probably arrived here by wind from Europe, it was always likely that we’d find it in coastal areas. Sadly that’s the case with the confirmation today of the disease in Kent and Essex. I would expect even more cases to be confirmed as our urgent survey of ash trees continues. “We will have the results of the initial survey in time for a major summit on tree and plant health later this week. Scientists, charities, landowners and the horticultural industry will meet  to agree the next steps for how we can work together to control this threat to our ash trees. “Over the weekend hundreds of people, both plant health experts and volunteers, were working flat out to find traces of this disease. I particularly want to thank the work of volunteers from organisations such as the Woodland Trust, the National Trust, the Country Land and Business Association and our National Parks who have given so much of their time.” A specialist team of staff has been set up, pulling staff from Defra, Fera, Forestry Commission, Natural England and the Environment Agency to be deployed in surveying forests for signs of Chalara in ash trees. The ash tree is a native British species of tree, providing around five percent of all woodland cover. Chalara is a serious disease that has affected a high proportion of ash trees in northern Europe and which was confirmed as present in nursery stock in the UK in March Government scientists set out the most up-to-date understanding of the disease. Their assessment agreed with the earlier Pest Risk Analysis carried out in August and concluded that: • the spores are unlikely to survive for more than a few days; • spore dispersal on the wind is possible from mainland Europe; • trees need a high dose of spores to become infected; • the spores are produced from infected dead leaves during the months of June to September; • there is a low probability of dispersal on clothing or animals and birds; • the disease will attack any species of ash; • the disease becomes obvious in trees within months rather than years; • wood products would not spread the disease if treated properly; • once infected, trees can’t be cured; and • not all trees die of the infection, and some are likely to have genetic resistance. Government scientists are working with their counterparts in other countries to learn from existing and emerging research and practical experience in combating the disease in countries which have had it for longer than the UK. Government scientific experts are also approaching companies with proposed treatment solutions for Chalara to rapidly evaluate their research to see if they have potential for further testing and development.

/government/news/survey-reveals-ash-disease-in-six-further-counties,"The disease has now been confirmed in 115 sites: in 15 nurseries, 39 planting sites and 61 locations in forests and woodlands. Survey reveals ash disease in six further counties  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Further cases of the tree disease Chalara, also known as ash dieback, have been confirmed in woodland in Sussex, Berkshire, Bedfordshire, Lincolnshire, Yorkshire and Northumberland after an unprecedented survey of Britain’s established woodlands. These instances of Chalara are being discovered as a result of a rapid and intensive surveying operation carried out over the course of last weekend and the beginning of this week. The discovery of the disease in these counties does not mean the disease is spreading rapidly. It is likely that the disease has been present in these areas for a number of years, originally caused by spores blown in from mainland Europe. Plant health experts, in conjunction with volunteers from groups such as the National Trust and Woodland Trust have been examining around 2,500 blocks of land, each 10 kilometres square, where mature ash trees are known to be present in order to seek out traces of the disease in our established trees. At the same time, plant health experts have been undertaking an urgent check of 220 prioritised sites which have had saplings from nurseries where Chalara was found to be present.  Taken together, these surveys will give a much better picture of the extent of Chalara throughout the country, but will not have identified all cases of the disease; it is likely that more cases will emerge as checks continue. Martin Ward, Chief Plant Health Officer said: “We have thrown all possible resources at this surveying exercise which has given us a much clearer picture of the distribution of the disease to inform our evidence base. “The science on Chalara is still emerging and the more evidence we have, the greater our knowledge and understanding of this disease and the better we are able to tackle it. “I’d like to thank everyone involved in this survey.  Together we’ve surveyed over 92 percent of England and all of Scotland and Wales so far -a tremendous achievement, especially in such a short time, which shows our combined determination to deal with Chalara.” The ash tree is a native British species of tree, providing around five percent of all woodland cover.

Following the urgent survey to seek out traces of the disease in our woods and forests, East Sussex is the eleventh county in England where Chalara has been discovered; the other counties are Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex, Kent, West Sussex, Berkshire, Bedfordshire, Lincolnshire, Yorkshire and Northumberland. The disease has now been confirmed in 237 sites including 127 locations in the wider environment (forests and woodlands).  Chalara is likely to have been in this country for at least two years but has only recently been discovered in our forests and woodland as a result of the intensive survey carried out of sites across the UK where ash trees are known to be present. Martin Ward, Chief Plant Health Officer said: “Although the rate at which we are discovering new areas infected with Chalara is slowing, there are still results coming through from our surveying exercise earlier this month and reports from landowners and the public.  The better informed we are, the more effective we can be in our work to contain the spread and impact of this disease.” The ash tree is a native British species of tree, providing around five percent of all woodland cover.

/government/news/wildlife-crime-fight-continues,"Continued funding has secured the future of the UK National Wildlife Crime Unit (NWCU) Environment Minister Richard Benyon confirmed today. Wildlife crime fight continues  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs The NWCU is at the forefront of the UK’s fight against the growing illegal wildlife trade. Through effective intelligence-led enforcement, it targets key criminals engaged in serious and organised crime. Announcing the funding, Richard Benyon said: Wildlife crime is a very serious issue with organised gangs using the proceeds from illegally traded items like rhino horn to fuel other illegal activities. It’s right that a specialist unit supports the police in bringing these people to trial. The funding for another year will mean the unit can continue to bring criminals to justice and tackle the illegal wildlife trade both at home and abroad. The Wildlife Crime Unit has been instrumental in the UK in combating the illegal trade in rhino horn, which now has a blackmarket value in Asia as high as gold. During 2012 the NWCU : provided direct assistance in 175 cases; supported a further 74 cases and provided direct input into 13 ongoing enforcement operations involving wildlife and other criminality within the UK; collated and assessed 970 intelligence logs helped with a number of the 57 cases known to have been brought; supported a Europol project focussing on illegal trade in rhino horn; and supported Interpol projects on internet trade in ivory, on the illegal trade in birds and on illegal trade in endangered species and tigers particularly . Defra funds £136,000 of the NWCU budget; it is additionally funded by the Home Office, who will match Defra funding with a further £136,000. Notes The NWCU is a strategic police unit, based in Livingston in Scotland, which collates intelligence and enforcement activity about wildlife crime across all UK police forces.

/government/news/calls-for-crackdown-after-bird-of-prey-poisoning-maps-are-published,"Nineteen incidents of illegal poisonings occurred in 2011 bringing the total number of confirmed cases since 2007 to 101. Calls for crackdown after bird of prey poisoning maps are published  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Maps showing where birds of prey have been poisoned should serve as a wake-up call, Environment Minister Richard Benyon said today. The maps, published for the first time by the Partnership for Action Against Wildlife Crime (PAW), highlight both the number and location of confirmed poisonings of birds of prey from 2007 to 2011 across England and Wales. Nineteen incidents of illegal poisonings occurred in 2011 bringing the total number of confirmed cases since 2007 to 101. Environment Minister Richard Benyon said: I am appalled that these crimes continue to be committed and I am determined to stamp them out. Those responsible have no consideration for what they are killing or the impact their activities are having on wildlife and the wider environment. I want people to be alert to this problem and report their suspicions to the police. It is about time we put an end to this cruel and barbaric crime. The information published today also shows that the majority of poisonings were carried out using substances called Carbofuran, or aldicarb, which are illegal to possess in the UK and are potentially dangerous to humans. Members of the public are warned not to touch any suspected poisoned animals or baits and to report them to their local police by calling 101. Bob Elliot, the RSPB’s head of investigations, said: These maps are welcome as they illustrate the problem that our birds of prey face. We need to remember, however, that these dots represent the tip of a much bigger iceberg as these criminal offences are often discovered by pure chance. These aren’t just points on a map. Each dot represents a crime where a bird of prey has been killed in a calculated way. Birds of prey have suffered centuries of persecution, and these maps prove those attitudes still prevail today. We will continue to work in partnership to ensure that we all bear down on these unacceptable crimes. Glynn Evans, head of game and gamekeeping at the UK’s largest shooting organisation, the British Association for Shooting and Conservation (BASC) said: The use of illegal poisons to kill birds of prey has no place in modern land and wildlife management. The British Association for Shooting and Conservation welcomes the publication of these incident maps which will be valuable tools in combating those who persist with this unacceptable practice. Wales’ Environment Minister, John Griffiths, said: I welcome the publication of these maps, which show the extent of this problem and focus attention on the illegal poisoning of birds of prey. The Welsh Government is working with a number of organisations to send the message loud and clear that the illegal poisoning of wildlife is not acceptable and the law will be enforced. The maps are available at www.defra.gov.uk/paw Notes These new charts show confirmed incidents of illegal poisoning. In 2011 there were 19 incidents, in which 30 birds of prey were poisoned. The mapping project is an action supported by all members of the PAW England & Wales Raptor Persecution Priority Delivery Group which includes the Police, National Wildlife Crime Unit, BASC, Defra, the Moorland Association, Natural England,  National Gamekeepers Organisation, Northern England Raptor Forum, RSPB and the Welsh Government."
/government/news/more-than-half-of-the-uk-public-believe-that-rhinos-will-be-extinct-in-the-wild-in-30-years,"The 'If They're Gone…' campaign will run for a full year and starts with a focus on rhinos. Every three months the focus will switch. More than half of the UK public believe that rhinos will be extinct in the wild in 30 years  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs A poll conducted by YouGov and published today has found that 54% of people in the UK do not think that animals like tigers, rhino, and orangutans will exist in the wild in 30 years time. This shocking statistic comes as Secretary of State Owen Paterson launches the year long ‘If They’re Gone…’ campaign, which has been designed to highlight the threats posed to four iconic endangered species - rhinos, tigers, orangutans and elephants The campaign, which has been launched at the Cotswold Wildlife Park, involves more than 20 organisations from key wildlife organisations, zoos and safari parks. The campaign will provide more information on the plight of these species and give practical advice on how people’s decisions can help save these majestic animals from extinction. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson said: Today, I am launching a very important campaign. ‘If They’re Gone…’ aims to raise awareness and encourage individuals to take action to protect four of the planet’s most iconic species, rhinos, elephants, orangutans and tigers, from extinction. I don’t want future generations to think of these species in the same way I think of the Dodo. We must act now. It’s by working together that we show international leadership in the fight against the disastrous trade in wildlife and devastating impact of deforestation. Charlie Mayhew, CEO of Tusk Trust said: On average this year one rhino has been lost to poachers every 11 hours. If this poaching continues to escalate, a species, which has existed on this planet for 40 million years, faces the very real prospect of extinction in our lifetime.  We cannot be the generation that allows this to happen and Tusk is working hard to preserve all endangered species in Africa. Reggie Heyworth, Owner of Cotswold Wildlife Park Rhinos are perhaps the iconic species at Cotswold Wildlife Park, and the recovery of the White Rhino population in the 20th Century from near extinction proves that we can save these magnificent animals. We must not let the poachers and the illicit traders win in the 21st Century: Rhinos now are under dreadful pressure but we can make a difference. The tide has been reversed before and we can do it again. We are all diminished as human beings by the poaching of these magnificent animals, and we must all do what we can to save them. Together all the campaign partners will help to raise awareness and encourage individuals to take action to protect the four species that are being highlighted. As such the campaign calls on the public to: Think before you buy anything that could be made from or contain body parts of endangered species; Ask where products have come from and if they have been produced sustainably; Get involved and support wildlife conservation programmes; Spread the word - tell your friends and family about tigers, rhinos, elephants and orangutans and how important it is to help protect them; and Report any suspicious activity concerning the buying and selling of wildlife products to your local police. Owen Paterson added: Together we can all make a difference by finding out if products have been produced sustainably and not buying goods made from illegal body parts or ivory. There are no medicinal benefits to traditional Asian medicines that contain animal parts and by turning your back on them you can help to protect these iconic animals” The launch of the ‘If They’re Gone…’ campaign coincides with the first day of the Convention of International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) conference in Bangkok. At this conference Defra is calling for maintaining the ban on ivory sales and to protect rhinos by introducing stricter measures on the export and re-export of rhino horn. Currently it’s estimated there are only 28,000 rhinos left in the wild. The ‘If They’re Gone…’ campaign will run for a full year and starts with a focus on rhinos. Every three months the focus will switch. A poster competition aimed at primary school children and an extensive programme of activity by all partners will run during different parts of the year.

/government/news/major-hunt-is-on-for-chalara-resistant-ash-trees,"A major project to find Chalara-resistant ash trees has been announced by Environment Secretary Owen Paterson.  Major hunt is on for Chalara-resistant ash trees  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs The £1.5 million project is part of the latest Chalara Management Plan published today, and will see a quarter of a million young ash trees planted in up to 25 sites. These sites will mainly be in East Anglia as this is the area with the most cases of Chalara and the young trees will be exposed and monitored in the search for resistance. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson said: “We know we can’t stop Chalara infecting our ash trees so we have to throw our resources into managing it and slowing the spread. A key part of that strategy will be identifying those trees which have a natural resistance to the disease so that we can re-stock our woodlands in the future. “This project of monitoring 250,000 young ash trees is unprecedented in its scope. The UK is leading the way internationally on trying to identify resistant strains. “However this is not the whole story.  In tandem with this project, we are also commissioning research to investigate genetic resistance in a laboratory setting. “In addition, we’re helping landowners replace their recently planted infected young ash trees with other trees to ensure that we have thriving woodlands for future generations.” The project, which is believed to be the first of its kind and scale in Europe, will use existing stocks of ash saplings which will be bought by Government and planted in the East and South East of the country.  Defra scientists and the Forestry Commission will work with local landowners to monitor the trees for signs of Chalara, paying particular attention to saplings which show resistance to the disease. The threat from a range of pests and diseases has increased over the last decade and shows no sign of decelerating.  This is one of the reasons that Environment Secretary Owen Paterson has put tree and plant health as one of Defra’s four key priorities, alongside animal health, improving the environment and growing the rural economy. Work carried out by Cambridge University supported the likelihood from the Autumn that Chalara is an airborne disease which has blown across from the continent.  It therefore concludes that it is impossible to prevent the disease spreading across the country. However, the impact and spread of Chalara could move slowly over generations with proper management strategies in place.  These include: Removal of young infected ash saplings; Continuing with the ban on movement of ash trees; and Continuing to monitor signs of Chalara in established woods and forests. That is why from April landowners will be able to apply for grants to plant other trees in areas where they would once have planted ash.  Owners of woodland in areas of the country with lower levels of Chalara will be able to access funding to help them remove any infected ash saplings to help to slow the spread of Chalara and replant with alternative trees. In the meantime, the process to evaluate the possible usefulness of various chemical treatments against Chalara, submitted by a number of producers, has reached a new stage.  Fourteen of the treatments that have been submitted for scientific analysis are being taken forward for laboratory testing.  These are a mixture of products which may be effective on live trees and those which may be effective on leaf litter.  These products need to be tested to ensure they do not adversely affect other wildlife or human health and investigated as to how they might be used. The interim Chalara Control Plan was published in December and focussed on: reducing the rate of spread; developing resistance to the disease in the native UK ash tree population; encouraging citizen, landowner and industry engagement and action in tackling the problem; and building resilience in the UK woodland and associated industries. In consultation with the various woodland groups involved in developing it, the new plan has continued the ongoing process of addressing these issues. This ongoing work is in addition to and complementary to the report from the Plant and Tree Health Independent Task Force, chaired by Professor Chris Gilligan, which is being published later in the Spring. The report will look at tree and plant health overall and make recommendations on how we can best protect our forests and woodlands against a variety of tree pests and diseases. The £1.5million of money into research for genetic resistance announced today is in addition to the £8 million the Government has already allocated for research into various pests and diseases which could affect our trees.

Stopping wildlife crime at the border  Border Force Home Office Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs The event was held at St James’s Palace and hosted by Their Royal Highnesses, The Prince of Wales and The Duke of Cambridge. Poaching In recent months, poaching of elephants and rhinos has reached epidemic levels. Wildlife experts indicate the losses have reached such unsustainable levels - in some places in the tens of thousands - that certain populations of African elephant are for the first time threatened with extinction within a decade. Wildlife crime Border Force and its specialist CITES (Convention of International Trade in Endangered Species) team play an important part in disrupting the illegal trafficking of animal and plant products. They work alongside the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and their campaign on endangered species, ‘If They’re Gone…’, which aims to raise awareness and encourage individuals to take action in order to protect some of the planet’s most iconic species. Grant Miller, senior officer for the CITES team, who attended the event said: Border Force is proud of the work we’re doing to protect and preserve endangered species. A lot has happened over the last 40 years of CITES. Border Force officers nationally have played a major role in its success working with partners across government and in non-governmental organisations. In the last financial year we have made more than 675 seizures of material. As part of the event, Border Force exhibited a number of products seized at the border including two large African elephant tusks; £1 million worth of rhino horn; ivory; taxidermy items (a bobcat and tiger cub); and plants including orchids, cycads and cacti.

/government/speeches/rt-hon-owen-paterson-speech-to-illegal-wildlife-trafficking-meeting,"Speech made by Owen Paterson on the illegal trade in wildlife. Rt Hon Owen Paterson speech to Illegal Wildlife Trafficking meeting  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs I would like to start by thanking Their Royal Highnesses for hosting today’s forum and for providing us with an opportunity to discuss this urgent and vital issue. It is inspiring to see and hear two generations of our Royal Family following in the footsteps of the Duke of Edinburgh who over many decades has done so much to promote the conservation of many of the species that are now under threat. The illegal trade in wildlife jeopardises the very survival of some of our most iconic species, like rhinos, elephants, tigers and orangutans. ‘If they’re gone…’ It is against this background that I launched the ‘If they’re gone…’ campaign at the Cotswold Wildlife Park back in March, focusing initially on rhinos. The campaign is a key part of our efforts to raise awareness of the impacts of the demand for products made from animal parts. Education must be a key weapon in our armoury. Rhino horn has the same medicinal value as my big toenail. Despite this, the seemingly insatiable appetite for rhino horn means that it is now fetching as much as £40,000 per kg. It is shocking that we are losing a rhino to poachers every 11 hours. This is reversing all of the good conservation work that saw white rhino numbers increase by around 9.5 per cent a year and black rhinos by 6 per cent between the early 1990s and the end of 2007. It is beyond depressing that between 2007 and 2011 there has been a 3,000 per cent increase in rhino poaching. In June, I will go to Knowsley to launch the next part of the ‘If they’re gone…’ campaign focusing on elephants. In 2011 more than 23 tonnes of illegal elephant ivory were seized around the world, that’s the equivalent of 2,500 elephants. These statistics are particularly worrying when it is estimated that up to 30 per cent of tree species in central African forests may require elephants to help with dispersal and germination. As the Prince of Wales has already said, these animals do not exist in isolation but at the heart of ecosystems and communities. What should shame us all is the fact that the perilous situation many of these species find themselves in is not as a result of some hideous disease that we can’t cure but as a result of human criminal violence. A human crime that is based on ignorance and greed. A human crime that supports a trade that is estimated to run into billions of dollars. This is a problem of global proportions that will need a coordinated global response. That’s why we must use events such as today to commit to redouble our efforts to protect these wonderful animals for future generations. We cannot afford to lose them or the habitats or ways of life they support. History will not forgive us if we allow vicious criminals to make them extinct. Implications of the trade This abhorrent trade not only puts our wildlife in danger. It poses an increasing threat to security by funding criminal gangs and terrorism. It also hampers efforts to tackle long term poverty. Collectively, we need to stop activities like poaching and illegal logging. It is also crucial that we end the demand for wildlife and wildlife products. We need to stop both supply and demand. Much good work is being done in this respect through international organisations such as CITES and INTERPOL. And the UK Government is determined to play its part. William Hague and I recently met other senior ministers to agree to focus our efforts on 3 key areas that will have the most impact. We want to improve enforcement, reduce market demand and help communities find viable alternatives. Owen Paterson speech at the End Wildlife Crime conference Enforcement To carry out enforcement in the UK, we have a dedicated National Wildlife Crime Unit within our Police Service and a dedicated Border Force team at Heathrow Airport monitoring imports of wildlife products. We are also helping to fund international enforcement through INTERPOL, the Global Tiger Initiative and the African Elephant Action Plan. We share our expertise in enforcement with other countries to strengthen global efforts. I would like all of us in this room to work together to make sure we’re learning best practice from one another. Supporting communities in developing countries The UK Government will continue to play an active role in the international legal framework through CITES. However CITES can only establish the framework for action. It is the responsibility of individual countries to implement these agreements. The UK is helping developing countries to implement CITES and other environmental agreements through the Darwin Initiative Grant Scheme. For example, a Darwin project in La Primavera forest in Mexico is looking into a local payment scheme to provide resources for rural development. This will protect biological corridors and halt land-use change in the oak-pine forest. We believe that this model, where a small amount of funding can lead to significant and long-lasting action on the ground, is an effective way to help. Concluding Remarks There is no doubt that the organised level of ruthless criminality that we’re up against will require strong international co-operation and leadership. We need to build consensus to tackle the underlying cause of poaching: the demand for wildlife products. The UK is committed to developing the tools and generating the international drive to help us safeguard these species. I believe that this meeting provides a tremendous basis for the gathering of Heads of States planned for the autumn, where I hope we can secure international agreement to work together to eradicate illegal wildlife trafficking. The prize if we do is glittering: a legacy for our children and their children after them. Failure will be a shame on us all. I would like to thank the Prince of Wales, once again, for getting us all together today and I look forward to working with each and every one of you to ensure that the amazing diversity of species on this planet not only survives, but under our watch, thrives."
/government/news/ivory-poaching-hits-record-levels,"A new drive to help save the elephant has been launched today by the government, in the wake of the highest levels of ivory poaching since records began.  Ivory poaching hits record levels  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) estimates that in 2011 at least 17,000 elephants have been killed illegally in Africa alone but the real figure may be much higher. At the same time a YouGov poll commissioned by Defra shows that more than a third of UK consumers are still unaware that parts of elephants (and other endangered species) are popular ingredients in traditional alternative medicines. Ivory is often used to carve valued ornaments and is falsely believed to help cure some diseases. If this continues, elephants could become extinct within our lifetime. Speaking at today’s launch at Knowsley Safari Park today, Environment Secretary Owen Paterson said: “Today, we are here to highlight the plight of this iconic and majestic animal, to ensure it’s still here for our children, and for future generations. “It’s totally unacceptable that elephants are being poached at such an alarming rate, fed by a high demand for traditional Asian medicine. “We are calling on people never to buy ivory or products that contain it, as if we buy, elephants die.” Broadcaster and writer Ben Fogle who is supporting the campaign said: “It’s unacceptable that elephants are being killed purely for their ivory. We must do all we can to stop this devastating crime and the ever increasing demand for ivory products. I am supporting the ‘If They’re Gone…’ campaign to raise awareness of the crisis situation which these truly breathtaking animals are in. We all need to act now before it’s too late.” Part of the year-long endangered-species campaign, ‘If They’re Gone’, the elephant season will run for three months, offering practical advice to consumers and tourists about how can play their part. Over 20 partners including wildlife organisations, zoos and safari parks have joined this fight to save them. Eveline De Wolf, Head of Animal Management at Knowsley Safari comments: “Many people will never see a herd of elephants in the wild, which is why safari parks have such an important role to play in helping communities understand the impact of poaching on this keystone species. “At Knowsley Safari, we have the power to make a difference, and through conservation and education, we are working to make sure that our children’s children grow up in a world where an elephant is more than just a memory.” You can take the following steps to help protect the elephant: Don’t buy ivory. If you buy, elephants die. Think before you buy anything that could be made from or contain body parts of endangered species such as certain alternative traditional medicines; Ask where products have come from and if they have been produced sustainably; Get involved and support wildlife conservation programmes; Spread the word - tell your friends and family about elephants and how important it is to help protect them; and Report any suspicious activity concerning the buying and selling of wildlife products to your local police. As part of the campaign, a primary school poster competition has been developed in partnership with Eco-Schools. Children from across the country have been invited to submit posters with the chance of winning a tour of Parliament. ‘If They’re Gone…’ focuses on the increasing threat to four endangered species; rhinos, elephants, orangutans and the tigers. For more information see the ‘If They’re Gone…’ Facebook page . Notes to Editors YouGov Poll - All figures, unless otherwise stated, are from YouGov plc. Total sample size was 1,704 adults. Fieldwork was undertaken between 24 - 25 February 2013. The survey was carried out online. The figures have been weighted and are representative of all GB adults (aged 18+). The launch of the elephant season comes only two weeks after the Illegal Wildlife Trafficking Conference hosted by HRH The Prince of Wales and the UK Government. The conference brought together officials from African, Asian, European and American countries, NGOs and multilateral organisations and recognised that this trade not only affects conservation efforts but also fuels organised crime and undermines the fight against poverty. Governments who attended agreed to meet again in London in the autumn at Heads of State level. For more information on the primary school poster competition see the Eco-Schools website .

/guidance/pests-and-diseases-in-combinable-crops,"How to recognise symptoms of common diseases in combine machine harvested crops, and prevent and control them with effective treatments. Pests and diseases in combinable crops Crops and horticulture  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Introduction Pests and diseases can affect crops and have a serious impact on the economic output of a farm. Farmers should vary their prevention and treatment methods depending on the crops they grow and the pests or diseases they are susceptible to, as they affect crops differently. Farmers also need to ensure that they balance pests and disease prevention and treatment methods against damage to the environment. This guide covers how to control pests and diseases in different types of combinable crops. It will explain how to spot early signs of certain diseases, the symptoms that they show, and how to prevent certain diseases completely and reduce the effects of others. Wheat disease management Wheat disease management is essential for controlling diseases in the following areas of wheat: foliar stembase root ear Seed production and certification Certifying seed is one way to reduce pests and diseases, and all seed bought and sold in the UK must be certified. Wheat quality must meet EU minimum standards and member states can set their own, higher standards. Farm Saved Seed ( FSS ) can be grown and processed on a farm. You must declare any use of FSS to the British Society of Plant Breeders ( BSPB ) and must not sell, share or exchange FSS . You can find out how to make an FSS declaration on the BSPB website . Organic certified seed must meet the same standards as conventional seed. Seed must be officially sampled and tested by the Food and Environment Research Agency ( Fera ) before certification. Find information on seed certification on the Fera website . Seed-borne diseases There are a number of seed-borne diseases, the most common of these being: bunt Microdochium seedling blight Septoria seedling blight Fusarium seedling blight Ergot seedling blight, foot rot and leaf spot loose smut To help recognise these diseases, you can find illustrated information on plant diseases on the Fera website . Once you have confirmed the diseases you should then choose a product to treat it. You can download the Home Grown Cereals Authority’s ( HGCA ’s) wheat disease management guidance from the Agricultural Document Library ( ADLib ) website (PDF, 3.38MB) . Other diseases There are a number of other diseases that can affect wheat crops and it is essential that you recognise these as soon as possible to limit contamination. Some of the most common diseases are: foliar diseases - eg leaf blotch, leaf and glume blotch, yellow rust, tan spot, powdery mildew root diseases - eg take-all stem based diseases - eg eyespot ear diseases - eg sooty moulds virus diseases - eg barley yellow dwarf virus Find illustrated information on plant diseases on the Fera website . Assessing disease risks You should start crop protection as upper leaves emerge, and before disease develops on yield-forming leaves. However, predicting disease is difficult and depends on a number of factors such as: disease pressure disease resistance rating weather conditions However, you can use crop management to limit disease risk. You can download the HGCA ’s wheat disease management guidance from the ADLib website (PDF, 3.38MB) . Fungicides Fungicides are often the best way to limit crop diseases. However resistance can occur when a disease becomes insensitive to a particular fungicide. To prevent resistance, you should: practise good hygiene - eg disposal of crop debris avoid large areas of any one variety of crop, especially in high disease areas only use fungicides when treatment is necessary use fungicides in mixture where possible to reduce the risk and use a minimum number of applications of the same active ingredient regularly monitor crops for diseases and resistance You can  read updates on fungicide resistance on the Chemicals Regulation Directorate website . Barley pest and disease control Barley diseases can affect the growth and survival of both tillers and spikelets which can affect initial plant count. Therefore early disease management is vital, as initial plant count is important for a successful yield and economic profits. Seed production and certification Certifying seed is one way to reduce pests and diseases, and all seed bought and sold in the UK must be certified. Wheat quality must meet European Union ( EU ) minimum standards and member states can set their own higher standards. FSS can be grown and processed on a farm. You must declare any use of FSS to the BSPB . You must not sell, share or barter FSS . You can make a FSS declaration on the BSPB website . Organic certified seed must meet the same standards as conventional seed. Seed must be officially sampled and tested by Fera before certification. You can find information on seed certification on the Fera website . Seed-borne diseases There are a number of seed-borne diseases, the most common of these being: loose smut leaf stripe covered smut seedling blights seedling blight, foot rot and leaf spot net blotch Ramularia leaf spot Rynchosporium To help recognise these diseases, you can find illustrated information on plant diseases on the Fera website . Once you have confirmed the diseases you should then choose a product to treat it. You can download the HGCA ’s wheat disease management guidance from the ADLib website (PDF, 3.38MB) . Foliar and stem-based disease control Disease control should keep the crop healthy during the growth stages that are most important for yield. The three grain yield phases are: number of ears per unit grain numbers per ear average grain weight It is essential you keep crops protected from disease during these phases. These phases occur at different dates depending on winter or spring sowing. The most common diseases to affect barley are: foliar diseases - eg brown rust, yellow rust and powdery mildew stem-based diseases - eg eyespot ear diseases and mycotoxins - eg ergot virus diseases - eg barley yellow dwarf virus, soil-borne mosaic viruses Find illustrated information on plant diseases on the Fera website . Assessment of disease risks You should start crop protection as upper leaves emerge, before disease develops on yield-forming leaves. Forecasting disease is difficult and depends on a number of factors such as: disease pressure field resistance of the crop crop variety’s genetic resistance You can use crop management to limit disease risk. You can download the HGCA ’s wheat disease management guidance from the ADLib website (PDF, 3.38MB) . Fungicides Fungicides are often the best way to limit crop diseases. However resistance can occur when a disease becomes insensitive to a particular fungicide. To prevent this, you should: practise good hygiene - eg disposal of crop debris avoid large areas of any one variety of crop, especially in high disease areas only use fungicides when treatment is necessary use minimum amounts of fungicide regularly monitor crops for diseases and resistance Karnal bunt Karnal bunt ( Tilletia indica ) is a quarantine fungus of wheat, durum wheat and triticale. It is not present in the EU but has been found in grain imported for consumption. Effects of the disease Karnal bunt reduces grain quality significantly which has an impact on grain marketability, and can cause large economic losses. Countries where Karnal bunt is present often suffer damage to their export markets as countries often regulate against the disease. Therefore it is essential that this is not introduced to the UK. Symptoms The Karnal bunt fungus spreads through the infected seed from its germinal end along the seed groove. Occasionally however, the infection may be limited to the germinal end. The following symptoms may also be present: dark coloured spores under the grain surface badly infected grain can smell of rotting fish grain splits at harvest leaving hollow or broken grains The disease is currently found in the following areas: Asia - India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Nepal, Iraq and Iran Mexico USA South Africa Prevention The disease is not currently present in any EU member state and prevention of spread is essential. The disease spreads through the rupture of infected grains when they are harvested. The fungus then spreads to the soil where it can survive for up to five years - or longer if it is in stored seed - and contaminate further crops. The only way to prevent the fungus is to acquire seed from an area or location where the fungus does not occur. You should follow this rule for: wheat rye triticale imported grain for feeding or milling If you suspect you may have the presence of this disease, you should contact the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs ( Defra ) Plant Seeds Health Inspector ( PHSI ) immediately. You can call the Fera PHSI Division on 01904 465 625 or email them at planthealth.info@fera.gsi.gov.uk . You can also find your nearest PHSI office on the Fera website . Oilseed and other cereal disease and pest control Controlling cereal diseases and pests varies slightly for each cereal crop, although the control methods are similar for all cereals. Controlling oilseed and cereal diseases Monitoring and using fungicides is the most efficient way to control cereal diseases. You can find a cereal disease encyclopaedia on the HGCA website . Another way to control cereal disease levels is to monitor crop disease levels in your region. Crop Monitor is a HGCA -funded initiative that allows you to monitor crop health and crop protection in wheat and oilseed rape crops in England and Wales. Find information on crop pest and disease activity on the Crop Monitor website . Fungicides Fungicides are often the best way to limit crop diseases. However resistance can occur when a disease becomes insensitive to a particular fungicide. To prevent this, you should: practise good hygiene - eg disposal of crop debris avoid large areas of any one variety of crop, especially in high disease areas only use fungicides when treatment is necessary use minimum amounts of fungicide regularly monitor crops for diseases and resistance Oilseed and cereal pest control The impact of pests on yield and quality can be more variable than that of many diseases. However, pest control must be balanced against damage to the environment and encouraging other insects which may benefit the crop. The following steps can help you produce effective pest control: assess the risk of infestations minimise pest risk by cultural means introduce natural enemies use treatments where economically justified You should follow general principles of pest management at each stage of the process. Before sowing: for pests that seed treatments may control - you should check whether they have caused previous crop damage, and if the risk has increased before using seed treatment for pests that cultivations may control - you should check if regrowth increases pest risk before early ploughing or using dessicant From sowing to emergence, you should check whether slugs pose a threat and whether they are above the threshold before sowing deeper, using traps or molluscicide. After emergence, you should check if there is a risk of an imminent attack, and if natural enemies are present before treatment For specific treatments of pests, you can find cereal pests factsheets on the Fera website . For general information on rodent and pest control, see the guide on managing wildlife and pests . Mycotoxins Mycotoxins are toxic chemicals produced by specific fungi which infect crops. As different species produce mycotoxins of varying toxicity, there are different levels allowed into human and animal foodstuffs and feed. Mycotoxins can be classified into two groups: field mycotoxins storage mycotoxins Field mycotoxins Mycotoxins can occur when a crop is out in the field. For example, Fusarium infection in grain ears can lead to mycotoxin development during flowering - especially when the weather is warm and wet. Field mycotoxins can also occur more often if harvests are delayed due to wet weather. You can minimise field mycotoxins by limiting certain risk factors. In particular you should: rotate crops to minimise wheat after maize, as maize can cause a high risk of potential mycotoxin pollution remove straw to reduce crop debris  or ensure crop debris is buried by ploughing cultivate to mix crop debris into upper soil layer consider ear spray during flowering, especially if weather is to be wet apply the correct doses of fungicide during flowering, as close to infection time as possible prepare crops before harvest to minimise delays harvest grain as soon as possible consider growing crops with lower risk of contamination Download the HGCA ’s guidance on reducing field mycotoxins from the ADLib website (PDF, 283KB) . Storage mycotoxins Mycotoxins can also be produced when crops are in storage - particularly if grain exceeds 18 per cent moisture content. The greatest risks occur: during harvest backlogs during ambient air drying when grain may take weeks to dry To reduce the possibility of storage mycotoxins, check your grain is correctly dried and cooled. In particular, you should consider: hot-air drying or stirring if you have wet grain - this reduces the length of time that grain is above 18 per cent moisture cooling grain using an airflow rate of around 10 cubed metres per hour - you can measure the airflow rate yourself or get airflow data from a manufacturer recording the length of time you run your fans controlling fans using a differential thermostat running bulk drying fans - if using - for a shorter time than cooling fans ways of voiding hot air from any building containing fans Spray technology It is essential that if you are applying fungicide or pesticides to your crop that you use the appropriate sprays. If you apply too much fungicide, insecticide or pesticides, then resistance may occur as disease can become insensitive to that particular spray. It is therefore essential that you apply the correct dose of the treatment to your crop. To do this, you must ensure that you calculate the correct volume of spray to use. Low volume spraying You should try to use the lowest volume of product you can. Although most products recommend application at 200 litres per hectare, they can often be sprayed at lower volumes and be just as effective. If you use lower volumes, then coverage can be improved as you can cover a larger area of crops more efficiently. When considering low volume spraying you should: check manufacturer information to ensure that product can be applied at volumes lower than the minimum specified on the label assess the extent to which using low application volumes can improve work rates choose an appropriate nozzle for the target and to reduce drift risk always check with your pesticide adviser before using water volumes below those recommended on the product label You can use the HGCA spray volume calculator to work out how much of the relevant product you should use.  Find the spray volume calculator on the HGCA website . You will achieve maximum efficiency by: maximising pesticide deposition on the correct area of the target plant - rather than achieving maximum deposition on the whole plant ensuring that the distance between individual pesticide deposits does not result in variation in pesticide deposition between target plants ensuring other factors, such as too low volumes and boom instability do not lead to variations in pesticide deposition between target plants ensuring a high concentration of the pesticide in the spray solution does not impede its penetration of the plant Spray nozzles When applying sprays, you should also consider the nozzle you will use for applications. You can download HGCA ’s spray nozzle selection information from the ADLib website (PDF, 249KB) . Organisations that can help Controlling pests and diseases in combinable crops is an essential task and there are a number of bodies that can offer help and support.

/government/news/ash-disease-found-in-devon,"A further case of the tree disease Chalara, also known as ash dieback, has been confirmed in a woodland in Devon. Ash disease found in Devon  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Devon is the 11th county in England where Chalara has been discovered in the wider environment (forests and woodland); the other counties are Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex, Cambridgeshire, Kent, Surrey, West Sussex, East Sussex, Lincolnshire and Northumberland. The disease has now been confirmed in 525 sites including 185 locations in the wider environment. Chalara was discovered in England’s woodland last Autumn as a result of the intensive survey carried out of sites across the UK where ash trees are known to be present. As the trees are leafing, it is easier to see cases of Chalara and further sites are likely to be identified. Martin Ward, Chief Plant Health Officer said: “We expected to see new cases as the leaves came through on ash trees. The better informed we are, the more effective we can be in our work to slow the spread and reduce the impact of this disease and we will be investigating this new case closely.” As part of the Government’s plan to manage Chalara, published in March, work is ongoing to identify genetic resistance in ash trees. A quarter of a million saplings have been planted in East Anglia to expose them to Chalara and they will be monitored to see which ones show signs of resisting the disease. This work complements research being undertaken in the laboratory to isolate a Chalara-resistant genome. Later this month Defra is hosting a summit to discuss how we collectively respond to the recommendations made in the report from the independent Tree Health and Plant Biosecurity Expert Task Force published in May. The ash tree is a native British species of tree, providing around five percent of all woodland cover. Chalara is a serious disease that has affected a high proportion of ash trees in northern Europe and which was confirmed as present in nursery stock in the UK in early 2012. A map showing all locations with confirmed cases of Chalara is available at - www.forestry.gov.uk/chalara ."

Endangered animals: join #thebigroar to highlight their plight  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs The #TheBigRoar Twitter event sparked a worldwide conversation on endangered species. This event gave the public the opportunity to put their questions to the experts. A summary is available on Storify . Kate Silverton is supporting the plight of wild rhinos, elephants, tigers and orangutans as part of Defra’s twitter event, #thebigroar, on 10 July from 9:15am to 3pm. As part of Defra’s ‘If They’re Gone…’ campaign, Kate will join Environment Minister Richard Benyon and many other organisations in a bid to inspire individuals to take action to help these four iconic species, which are threatened with extinction within our lifetime. Poaching of elephants and rhinos has now reached unprecedented levels, with the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) estimating that at least 17,000 elephants were killed illegally in Africa alone (2011), but the real figure is likely to be much higher. Their natural habitats are being destroyed at an alarming rate and the demand for traditional Asian medicines, which uses parts of tigers and rhinos, is skyrocketing internationally. Throughout the day, people can put questions to different organisations who can give a unique insight into the different aspects of species conservation. People will also be able to find out how they can help to save these animals for future generations, because if they’re gone, they’re gone forever. The organisations partnering with Defra on #thebigroar are WWF-UK, Zoological Society London, Tusk Trust, TRAFFIC, Helping Rhinos, Interpol and the Environmental Investigation Agency.

Ash disease found in Dorset  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Dorset is the 13th county in England where Chalara has been discovered in the wider environment (forests and woodland); the other counties are Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex, Cambridgeshire, Kent, Surrey, West Sussex, East Sussex, Devon, Lincolnshire, Yorkshire and Northumberland. The disease has now been confirmed in 557 sites including 198 locations in the wider environment. Chalara was discovered in England’s woodland last Autumn as a result of the intensive survey carried out of sites across the UK where ash trees are known to be present. As the trees are leafing, it is easier to see cases of Chalara and further sites are likely to be identified. Martin Ward, Chief Plant Health Officer said: “We expected to see new cases once the leaves came through on ash trees. The better informed we are, the more effective we can be in our work to reduce the impact of this disease and we will be investigating this new case closely.” As part of the Government’s plan to manage Chalara, published in March, work is ongoing to identify genetic resistance in ash trees. Saplings have been planted in sites across East Anglia to expose them to Chalara and they will be monitored to see which ones show signs of resisting the disease. This work complements research being undertaken in laboratories to isolate a Chalara-resistant genome. In June Defra hosted a summit to discuss how we collectively respond to the recommendations made in the report from the independent Tree Health and Plant Biosecurity Expert Task Force, published in May. At the summit an initial risk register of 70 pests and diseases which could potentially affect plants and trees in this country was presented. Good progress is also being made to catalogue the threat posed by some 700 more pest and diseases present across the world. The ash tree is a native British species of tree, providing around five percent of all woodland cover. Chalara is a serious disease that has affected a high proportion of ash trees in northern Europe and which was confirmed as present in nursery stock in the UK in early 2012.

Defra’s If They’re Gone… campaign is supporting World Rhino Day (22 September) which celebrates all five species of rhino: Black, White, Greater one-horned, Sumatran and Javan rhinos. The If They’re Gone… campaign launched in March 2013, involves more than 20 organisations from key wildlife groups, zoos and safari parks. The campaign aims to raise awareness and highlight the threats to rhinos along with three other iconic endangered species tigers, elephants and orangutans. The campaign calls on the public to: think before you buy anything that could be made from or contain body parts of endangered species ask where products have come from and if they have been produced sustainably get involved and support wildlife conservation programmes spread the word - tell your friends and family about tigers, rhinos, elephants and orangutans and how important it is to help protect them report any suspicious activity concerning the buying and selling of wildlife products to your local police The If They’re Gone… campaign is running for a full year and for more information visit the ‘If They’re Gone…’ Facebook page See our If They’re Gone… infographic on our Flickr site World Rhino Day website"

UK boosts fight against illegal wildlife trade  Department for International Development Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs The Department for International Development (DFID) and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) have joined forces for the first time in the fight against international wildlife crime. Justine Greening and Owen Paterson have announced today a £10 million DFID funded package to support efforts by the UK and other countries to tackle illegal trade in wildlife products including rhino horn and elephant ivory. The illegal wildlife trade is a multi-billion pound activity which promotes corruption, damages tourism opportunities and undermines economic growth in some of the world’s poorest countries. Heavily armed poachers and organised criminal networks are destroying some of the world’s most iconic species and posing a threat to security in rural African communities. The UK is playing a leading role in efforts to end the illegal wildlife trade and will hold an international conference next February, to be hosted by the Prime Minister in the presence of His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, to work with our international partners to spur action to combat this growing threat. Funding will be awarded to support action in developing countries including on: reducing the opportunity and incentive to poach by improving economic opportunities and promoting security and good governance providing training and access to better equipment and practical support to agencies in their efforts to address the illegal trade reducing demand for illegal wildlife and animal products such as elephant ivory, rhino horn, and tiger parts by raising awareness of the impacts and economic losses caused by wildlife crime. International Development Secretary Justine Greening said: “By working with DEFRA to tackle the illegal wildlife trade we are helping to improve the economic opportunities of the poorest people whose livelihoods depend on natural resources. DFID carries out significant work tackling corruption and illicit flows from developing countries and this fund will also help stop the corruption fuelled by the illegal wildlife trade.” Environment Secretary Owen Paterson said: “Poaching devastates livelihoods and sustainable communities as well as endangering the existence of these wonderful animals. We must work together with other countries to stamp it out by stopping demand, improving enforcement and by helping communities develop sustainable economic activity. The wildlife in areas where this is already being done becomes a valued and protected community asset so both the wildlife and the community benefit.” The fund will be available to address illegal wildlife trade in the most affected developing countries, either because they have threatened populations of animals or a strong demand for illegal wildlife products. ‘Transit’ developing countries through which the trade in wildlife occurs, including some of those in the Commonwealth, will also be eligible. The fund will be available to governments, charities and NGOs. The London Conference will be hosted by the Prime Minister in the presence of His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales and aims to address three inter-related aspects of the illegal wildlife trade: supporting the development of sustainable livelihoods for communities affected by illegal wildlife trade improving law enforcement and the role of the criminal justice system reducing demand for wildlife products.

/government/news/uk-gives-support-to-kenya-in-fight-against-wildlife-poaching,"British Environment Secretary announces British Army support to tackle poaching in Kenya. UK gives support to Kenya in fight against wildlife poaching  Ministry of Defence Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs British Secretary of State for the Environment, Owen Paterson, is visiting Kenya this week where he will announce that the British Army will join forces with Kenyan anti-poaching groups later this month in an effort to crack down on illegal wildlife crime. To help in the fight against poaching, British Army paratroopers will provide patrolling and field training to members of the Kenyan Wildlife Service (KWS), Kenyan Forestry Service (KFS), and Mount Kenya Trust (MKT) over the next few weeks. During his visit, Mr Paterson will also discuss the importance of a strong legal framework to punish and deter the perpetrators of poaching and will highlight the work that the British High Commission, through its Criminal Justice Advisor, has been doing with the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and others, leading to the setting up of Kenya’s Wildlife Crime Taskforce. Speaking ahead of his visit Environment Secretary Owen Paterson said: “It will be an honour to meet so many people who work so hard to conserve some of the world’s most iconic species for ourselves and our children. “Illegal poaching is having a devastating effect on some of the world’s most iconic species and we must work together to tackle it. “By joining forces with those on the front line in Kenya, our armed services will be able to provide training and support to the courageous people who put their lives on the line every day to protect these animals.” The Environment Secretary will also use the visit to extend an invitation to the Kenyan Cabinet Secretary for Foreign Affairs & International Trade, Amina Mohamed, to attend the London conference on illegal wildlife trade in February next year. This conference will focus on illegal wildlife crime and aims to tackle three inter-related aspects of illegal wildlife trade: improving law enforcement and the role of the criminal justice system; reducing demand for wildlife products; and supporting the development of sustainable livelihoods. The conference will focus primarily on elephants, rhinos and tigers as these iconic species are the primary targets of organised criminal activity and are facing unprecedented levels of poaching. Owen Paterson added: “I want the London conference to be an event at which colleagues from across the world come together and agree the detail of how we will work together to tackle the scourge of illegal wildlife trade and leave the world a better place for future generations.” Photocredit: Tusk Trust"

Flood defences: South Derbyshire residents help protect their homes  Environment Agency Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs The Lower Dove flood defence scheme has just opened and is a successful example of private-public partnership. Local authorities, parish councils and local businesses worked in partnership with the Environment Agency to protect 1600 residential properties in the South Derbyshire villages of Scropton, Hatton and Egginton. Existing flood banks and flood walls have been improved and new ones added to improve the standard of defence. Nestle made a significant contribution to the cost of this work as it reduced the risk of flooding to their factory. They also built a new diversion channel for the Salt Brook which improved biodiversity and incorporated a new bridle path providing amenity for the local community. Residents in the 31 homes in a Hatton cul-de-sac have clubbed together to buy the field behind their homes and then obtained grant funding to turn the field into a local nature reserve. They have planted trees and wildflowers around the flood bank and it is now not only a form of protection, but also a local leisure attraction. Lynne Saul, secretary of Thistley Place Meadow Nature Reserve, said: In the 2000 floods our house was surrounded by water. It was like a lake. The water came with such force that the river broke through a wall which protects some bungalows. It was like a tsunami. It was a miracle that the bungalows were still standing.

/guidance/combinable-crops,"Payments under agricultural policies for farms growing combinable crops, grants for processed fodder and biofuels and the EU cereals intervention scheme. Cereals, oilseeds and fodder: getting funding  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Introduction The UK is one of the largest producers of cereal and oilseed crops in the EU . Within UK agriculture, cereal crops account for about 15% of total UK agricultural land, but over 65% of total cropping. Cereals such as wheat and barley and oilseeds such as oilseed rape are grown on around 71,000 holdings across the country with the majority grown in the southern and eastern part of England. This guide covers combinable crop production in the UK - ie all types of crops gathered by use of a combine harvester. It explains the roles of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs ( Defra ) and the Rural Payments Agency ( RPA ). It also includes information on the Single Payment Scheme ( SPS ), aid for dehydrated fodder, non-food crops and briefly mentions Cross Compliance. Finally, it covers the EU cereals intervention scheme, including how to offer cereals for intervention. Combinable crops production in the UK Wheat, barley and oilseed rape are the most important combinable crops grown in the UK and oat production is on the increase. All these cereals are well suited to the UK’s temperate climate. The majority of cereals are sown in the autumn, known as ‘winter cereals’ as the young plants have to survive the winter in the open fields. These cereals are usually higher yielding because of the longer growing period. The remaining cereals are sown in the spring. Wheat Wheat is the most widely grown arable crop in the UK. On average, it covers around two million hectares of land and produces about 15 million tonnes each year. Wheat is a versatile crop and is used mainly for milling into flour for bread and starch - about 40% of annual production - and as an animal feed ingredient - around 50% - with most of the rest being exported. It is found in numerous food products, including bread, cakes, biscuits and breakfast cereals. Barley Barley is grown on around one million hectares and produces an output of around five million tonnes. About 1.7 million tonnes are used in the production of malt - a key ingredient in beer and whisky. The remaining barley is mostly used in animal feeds or exported. Oilseed rape The bright yellow flowers of oilseed rape cover around 0.6 million hectares each year and produce around two million tonnes of seed. The seed is crushed to extract oil, which is used in the food and animal feed industries, with the residue being used as a high protein animal feed ingredient. Oilseed rape is also used for the production of biodiesel. Oats Oats use around 3% of the total UK cereals area and are mostly sown in the autumn months. About half of the oat crop is milled and used for human consumption - eg breakfast cereals, cheese biscuits and haggis - with the rest being used for animal feed. Aid for dehydrated fodder The EU ’s aid for dehydrated fodder scheme pays aid to processors who dry and market ‘green fodder’ within guaranteed national quantities and quality requirements. ‘Green fodder’ includes products intended for animal feed such as lucerne, sainfoin, clover, lupins, and vetches. The aid rate is fixed at €33 per tonne. It is granted for processed fodder, provided that its maximum moisture content is between 11% and 14% and its crude protein content in dry matter is not less than 15% or 45%, depending on the product concerned. You may be entitled to advance payment of €19.80 per tonne or €26.40 per tonne if you have lodged a security of €6.60 per tonne. For each marketing year - running from 1 April to the following 31 March - a maximum guaranteed quantity ( MGQ ) of dehydrated or sun-dried fodder applies. If the quantity of dried fodder produced in the European Community exceeds the MGQ for that marketing year, the amount of aid is reduced in those member states whose production has exceeded their guaranteed national quantity. This scheme applies to all of the following products: meal, pellets and other forms of lucerne, sainfoin, clover, lupins and vetches other similar artificially heat-dried fodder products lucerne, sainfoin, clover and certain other sun-dried and ground pulses protein concentrates obtained from lucerne juice and grass juice dehydrated products derived from concentrates If you supplied fodder to processors for drying during the historical reference period between 2000 and 2002, you may be eligible for entitlements under the SPS . From 1 April 2012, the aid for dehydrated fodder scheme will be fully incorporated into the SPS . In the UK, the RPA is responsible for administering both the aid for dehydrated fodder scheme and the SPS . For information on how SPS works, see the guide on the Single Payment Scheme ( SPS ) . The Single Payment Scheme You can claim payments for land used to grow combinable crops against SPS entitlements. You will need to adhere to Cross Compliance requirements in order to receive the direct payments in full. Most Cross Compliance standards are closely aligned with existing national law and best practice in the farming sector. For more information about SPS and how it can help your farming business, see the related guide on the Single Payment Scheme ( SPS ) . EU intervention scheme for cereals The EU cereals intervention scheme supports cereal prices by setting a guaranteed price for certain cereals - subject to them meeting minimum quality requirements and if their levels of contaminants do not exceed the maximum levels permitted under Community Regulations. The intervention scheme applies across the EU for common wheat, durum wheat, barley, maize and sorghum. However, in the UK, intervention schemes are only operated for common wheat and barley, with the latter more usually being taken up. The minimum quantity of either that can be offered for intervention in the UK is 100 tonnes but this amount can be formed by pooling up to four separate lots. Where the goods are to be intervened from in-situ storage - ie on-farm - rather than being delivered to a designated store - the minimum quantity is 5,000 tonnes. The RPA is responsible for administering the intervention scheme in the UK. Under the scheme, you can offer your grain to RPA between 1 November and 31 May. Subject to the appropriate sampling and inspection being satisfactorily carried out, you will then have to deliver your grain to the nearest intervention centre, or possibly store the grain on your own premises. If you are a farmer - or trader - with grain of a suitable quality that you wish to offer into intervention, you should contact RPA . The grain will be subject to sampling and inspection on - and possibly before - delivery which will determine whether it meets the regulatory quality rules. You will be responsible for delivering the grain to the nominated intervention store. As of 1 July 2010, intervention for common wheat takes place at the intervention price of €101.31 per tonne, up to a maximum quantity offered of 3 million tonnes. Once this quantity has been reached, intervention takes place by way of buying-in by tender. Note that although rice and durum wheat are not normally grown in the UK, quantities of these crops are set to zero - ie their intervention scheme is no longer in operation. The EU Commission does however retain the right to re-open this scheme at times of market disturbance. How to offer cereals for intervention Cereals intervention in the UK is limited, and it is generally only grain merchants - or their agents - who actually make use of the system. You must be aware of what you have to do in order to offer your grain. You must register with the RPA before you can offer your cereals for intervention, by completing form CEPU1 and returning it to them. Download form CEPU1 to offer to sell cereals into intervention from the RPA website (PDF, 70KB) . You can only submit your offer during the buying-in period, which is currently 1 November to 31 May. Your offer will only be accepted by RPA if your cereals are of ‘sound, fair and marketable quality’. They must also meet minimum quality criteria as defined in RPA scheme leaflet IM(C)15. You can download RPA scheme leaflet IM(C)15 from the Agricultural Document Library (ADLib) website (PDF, 856KB) . The intervention price for cereals When you offer your cereals under the cereals intervention scheme, the price is set at €101.31 per tonne. You will be paid the equivalent in pounds sterling at the current exchange rate. Sampling and testing, transportation costs and payment calendar You must allow samples of your cereals to be taken for testing before you will receive any payment. If your samples fail, you can appeal the decision within two days of receiving the results. You will have to pay a fee to appeal and you will be advised of the amount at the time. The cereals intervention section will then arrange for a reference sample to be tested. Further testing will take place once your cereal has been delivered. The storekeeper will weigh the load and take a representative sample, which is then divided into three subsamples. One sample is tested by the storekeeper, another will be returned to you, your offerer or his representative, and the final subsample is retained at the store as a reference sample. Tests will be carried out in accordance with the procedures set out in the RPA leaflet. These will confirm whether the cereals meet minimum European standards. Download the RPA ’s guide on analytical methods for determination of physical qualities from the Agricultural Document Library (ADLib) website (.PDF, 58K) . Transportation costs RPA will send you delivery instructions for each load, which will include: the contract number the delivery number the location - and communication details - of the intended store for delivery You or your offerer must arrange and pay for delivery to the store. You must do this in accordance with RPA delivery instructions and the timetable agreed with the storekeeper. RPA will then pay the intake costs if the cereals are purchased. The offerer is responsible for the cost of transporting the cereals to the storage place at the lowest cost where the distance is equal to or less than 100km. Once this distance has been exceeded, the transport costs over 100 km shall be paid for by RPA . RPA will pay for additional transport costs except for the first 20km if they change the storage place. However, the transport costs over 100km shall still be paid for by RPA . Payments calendar You must complete the claim form CEPU11 when the final delivery has been made and you have confirmation of the delivered tonnage on the weighbridge tickets returned from the store. The form should then be posted to the cereals intervention section at RPA . Claims should be sent immediately following receipt of the final weighbridge ticket, so that a takeover certificate may be issued and the total value of the contract calculated. Faxed submissions will not be processed until the hard copy is received. When RPA is satisfied that the contracted tonnage of cereals has been delivered and a claim has been received, a takeover certificate and a pricing document will be sent to the offerer. RPA will make arrangements for payment to be made no later than the 65th day after the date of issue of the takeover certificate. As payment is made on the basis of the amount shown in the pricing document, offerers invoices are not required. For further information on transportation costs and payments, you can download the RPA ’s guide on the support buying of cereals from the ADLib website (PDF, 856KB) . Further schemes and funding for farmers who grow combinable crops Some crops, including oilseeds, beet and wheat are grown for non-food production, eg bio-fuel for transport. Find information on the use of non-food crops on the National Non-Food Crops Centre website . In addition, vegetable protein-based crops are grown to supply products such as animal feed. The Protein Crop Premium The Protein Crop Premium ( PCP ) scheme helps support farmers growing key protein crops defined as: field beans within CN code 0713.50 peas within CN code 0713.10 sweet lupins within CN code ex 1209 29 50 The premium is paid at €55.57 per hectare. If the EU Maximum Guaranteed Area of 1.648 million hectares is exceeded, payments may be reduced. You can find information on the PCP scheme on the Rural Payments Agency website . The PCP scheme operates separately to the SPS . You can claim both schemes together on your SP5 application form, or either scheme individually. For more information, see the guide on the Single Payment Scheme ( SPS ) . Funding from the Rural Development Programme for England The Rural Development Programme for England ( RDPE ) helps farmers and growers run sustainable rural businesses and improve the competitiveness of the agricultural and forestry sectors in England. Find information in the guide on the Rural Development Programme for England ( RDPE ) . The RDPE is jointly funded by the EU - through the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development ( EAFRD ) - and the UK government. Funds from Common Agricultural Policy schemes can also be transferred into the RDPE as part of a process called ‘voluntary modulation’. The RDPE is structured around four EU objectives for rural development, called ‘Axes’: Axis 1 - improving the competitiveness of the farming and forestry sectors Axis 2 - improving the environment and the countryside Axis 3 - improving rural quality of life and diversification of the rural economy Axis 4 - the Leader approach Individual measures in each axis set out which farming activities are eligible for funding. Who to contact The following organisations offer grants in England under the RDPE : Defra for economic and social funding in rural areas under Axis 1 and 3 Natural England - through Environmental Stewardship schemes under Axis 2 the Forestry Commission - for forestry funding under Axes 1 and 2 Local Action Groups ( LAGs ) through the Leader Approach under Axis 4 You can  find your LAG on the RDPE Network website . From April 2012 RDPE delivery will consist of a single offer, available across the whole of England on consistent lines and with a consistent set of business processes.

Voahirana’s background Voahirana works for Madagasikara Voakajy ( MV ), a non-governmental organisation (NGO) in Madagascar which worked in partnership with Bangor University on a Darwin Initiative main project. The project contributed to the development of a national strategy to reduce the hunting of wild animals (including lemurs) for food. Building on Darwin project experience Voahirana’s Darwin Fellowship allowed her to obtain an MSc in Conservation and Land Management at Bangor University in Wales. Voahirana was able to get the training she needed whilst also building and developing a link between her organisation and the National Zoo of Wales which has provided financial support for lemur conservation in Madagascar. Educational success The fellowship was an enormous success. Voahirana excelled academically on her masters course (getting one of the best marks for her module on Conservation Biology) and presented her research at an international conference at the University of Cambridge. Building links between the UK and Madagascar Voahirana co-organised a fund-raising evening at the National Zoo of Wales. 120 people enjoyed Malagasy food, music and dancing and a speech from Voahirana about MV ’s work in Madagascar inspired many to make generous donations. Voahirana will apply what she has learnt while doing field work for her MSc dissertation on methods to reduce illegal hunting of wild animals for food in Madagascar and in her future work for MV . Reflections on the Darwin Fellowship Reflecting on her time in the UK, Voahirana said: “The Darwin fellowship was a great opportunity for me to benefit from high-level training and research instruction, which is not available on Malagasy postgraduate courses. This fellowship also improved my capacity in research design and writing academic quality English. Now, I am delighted to share my new skills with my colleagues to strengthen our organisation.”"

This is an issue that matters to the UK. In February we hosted a major conference of global leaders to help eradicate the trade once and for all, and from this conference came an ambitious political declaration containing 25 commitments to action. Our commitment to this has not wavered. Reports that elephants and rhinos could be extinct within our lifetimes have strengthened our resolve. We will be supporting Botswana in holding the follow-up Summit due to take place on the next World Wildlife Day - 3rd March 2015. This will be no talking shop. It will be an opportunity to review progress on the commitments made in London and to take further action. I urge participants to maintain the momentum . It will also be an opportunity to identify gaps where further work is needed and agree next steps including a possible third Illegal Wildlife Trade conference in Asia. Only coordinated international action will succeed in tackling this crime, and in dealing with the numerous issues that stem from it: from poverty and instability to the funding of terrorist activity. I would like this coordinated action to achieve even more, to reflect the gravity of the situation we find ourselves in, whether that is a UN Resolution or a Special Representative who can speak out on this issue. Whilst it is important not to duplicate existing efforts such as those of CITES and the International Consortium for Combating Wildlife Crime, we cannot pretend that this is enough for such a unique and prevalent problem as the illegal wildlife trade. We need real political commitment by governments around the world, firm resolve and strong action at all levels to tackle this trade. I therefore encourage action now to deliver on the London commitments, and urge high level attendance at the Botswana conference next year."

Non-members can purchase the 2011 version on the Freshfel website . Public campaigns for healthier eating in the UK and EU are showing signs of encouraging consumers to eat more fresh fruit and vegetables. However, increased demand does not always benefit the grower. This may be because: prices are forced down as supermarket chains strive to increase their market share consumer taste is not constant and new demand is often for exotic rather than homegrown varieties - 90% of fruit and 70% of specialist vegetables are being imported to match supply with demand the effects of currency fluctuations and in particular the lower value of sterling Levies payable by growers of horticultural produce The HDC serves British growers by driving research and development in horticulture and associated technology. The company also sponsors market research and promotion of specific products where there is shown to be a collective need for it. The HDC is a statutory body which administers the collection of an ‘industry levy’ to fund essential near-market research and development for the benefit of UK horticulture. The levy for most crops is 0.5% of annual turnover, with the exception of the mushroom industry. You are required to pay the levy if you grow or sell horticultural products, or sell anything derived from horticultural products, and if you have an adjusted sales turnover of £60,000 or more. The levy is calculated by years ending 31 March. Under the annual AHDB Order, horticultural products include: vegetables grown in the open, except potatoes - see the guide on potatoes fruit flowers and bulbs hardy nursery stock protected crops and herbs mushrooms - these are included, but growers pay on a different basis Mushroom growers are required to pay the levy if they buy more than 700 litres of mushroom spawn in any given year ending 31 March. This applies to spawn purchased separately or incorporated into compost. The maximum permitted levy rates are 20 pence per litre for agaricus mushrooms and 8 pence per litre for non-agaricus mushrooms.

In order to receive the full SPS payments, you must comply with a set of Statutory Management Requirements ( SMRs ). These relate to areas of public, animal and plant health, environment and animal welfare. You must also demonstrate that you are keeping your land in good agricultural and environmental condition ( GAEC ). Together, SMRs and GAEC are known as ‘cross compliance’. All agricultural activities are covered by Cross Compliance and you must comply with the requirements across the whole agricultural area of your holding, regardless of the amount of land you entered into the SPS . Most of these standards reflect legal requirements that you should already follow. To apply for payments, you need to fill in an annual SP5 application form, either electronically or as a hard copy. The deadline for applications is usually in May for payments starting 1 December. Find more information on the requirements and standards of Cross Compliance in the guides on Cross Compliance: the basics, SMR and standards of GAEC . For more information on how the SPS works, see the guide on the SPS . For technical advice and queries on cross compliance, contact the Cross Compliance Helpline on Telephone: 0845 345 1302. Read about the SPS on the RPA website . Producer Organisations on the Fresh Fruit and Vegetables Aid Scheme To help growers increase their competitiveness in the supply chain, the EU Fruit and Vegetables Regime provides financial support to co-operatives formed by producers, which must meet EU driven criteria and methodology to be recognised as Producer Organisations (POs). POs are legal organisations that require formal recognition by the Rural Payments Agency ( RPA ), which operates the Scheme. Once a PO is recognised, the members typically work together to obtain EU funding to: promote the use of environmentally sound cultivation and waste practices ensure that the organisation’s production is planned and adjusted to demand promote the concentration of supply reduce production costs improve the quality, marketing and end value of their produce monitor their members’ compliance with EU marketing standards, maximum permitted levels of pesticide residues, and generally keep within plant health requirements Find the guidance index for fruit and vegetables operational programmes on the RPA website . Area Payment for Nuts Scheme Payments for the Area Payment for Nuts Scheme ( APNS ) are linked to the area of eligible nuts grown. APNS is separate to the SPS , allowing you to make a claim on any nut orchard of a minimum plot size of 0.1 hectares on which you grow nuts that satisfy all the eligibility criteria for that type of nut as set out in the table: Crop codes and Tariff code ranges for different types of nut Type of nut Tariff code range Crop code Minimum tree density per hectare Almonds 0802 11 and 0802 12 NT3 50 Hazelnuts or filberts 0802 21 and 0802 22 NT1 125 Walnuts 0802 31 and 0802 32 NT2 50 Pistachios 0802 50 NT4 50 Locust beans (carob pods) 1212 10 10 - 30 A ‘nut orchard’ is defined as an unvarying and geographical continuous area which is not divided by other crops or plantations. Isolated nut trees or a single row of nut trees planted alongside roads or other crops are not considered to be an orchard. Although APNS is not decoupled from the SPS , you will need to use the annual SPS form SPS5 to make your application. The average payment of €120.75 per hectare will be reduced if the ceiling of the UK’s National Guaranteed Area of 100 hectares is exceeded. The payment will also be reduced by 19% for the combined EU and national modulation. The scheme rules are described in the latest version of the RPA ’s booklet: ‘Single Payment Scheme Handbook and Guidance for England’. RPA administers a wide range of CAP schemes. Find a list of individual CAP schemes on the RPA website . Rural Development Programme for England funding The Rural Development Programme for England ( RDPE ) aims to safeguard and enhance the rural environment by helping farmers and growers to run sustainable rural businesses and improve the competitiveness of the agricultural and forestry sectors in England. The RDPE is jointly funded by the EU - through the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development - and the government. Funds from CAP schemes can also be transferred into the RDPE as part of a process called ‘voluntary modulation’. The RDPE is structured around four EU objectives for rural development, called ‘Axes’ each of which sets out the type of farming activities eligible for funding: Axis 1 - improving the competitiveness of the farming and forestry sectors Axis 2 - improving the environment and the countryside Axis 3 - improving rural quality of life and diversification of the rural economy Axis 4 - the Leader approach Who to contact The following organisations offer grants in England under the RDPE : the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs ( Defra ) - by delivering economic and social funding in rural areas under Axes 1 and 3 Natural England - by offering funding for delivery of Environmental Stewardship agreements under Axis 2 the Forestry Commission - by offering forestry funding under Axis 1 and 2 Local Action Groups (LAGS) or the Leader approach under Axis 4 You can  find your LAG on the Defra website .

Horticultural marketing standards for fresh fruit and vegetables The EC marketing standards apply to most fresh fruit, vegetables, salad crops, nuts and cultivated mushrooms. These marketing standards are split into two types - Specific Marketing Standards ( SMS ) and a General Marketing Standard ( GMS ). SMS apply to 10 products and require classification into quality classes and full labelling, GMS applies to most other types of fresh fruit and vegetables, and requires compliance with a minimum quality standard as well as origin labelling. The Horticultural Marketing Inspectorate (HMI) of the RPA enforces the marketing standards and is responsible for checking produce for GMS and SMS compliance. For imports of SMS products, notification to import is required, this is done via PEACH (Procedure for Electronic Application for Certificates). SMS apply to the following ten types of fruit and vegetables if they are intended for sale in their natural state: fruits - apples, citrus fruit, kiwi fruit, peaches and nectarines, pears, strawberries, table grapes vegetables and salads - lettuces, curled-leaved and broad-leaved endives, sweet peppers and tomatoes However you can use GMS instead of SMS if the produce is sold at retail for customers’ personal use and you label it with the wording ‘intended for processing’ or similar. If produce is intended for use in industrial processing or as animal feed and is marked as such, it is exempt from the marketing standards. For imports of GMS products, you do not have to notify the HMI via the PEACH system. However the HMRC (Her Majesty’s Revenue & Customs) Chief system does make a 1% random selection of GMS products and requests a PEACH application, but this is only needed if requested by Chief. Under the GMS , the size and shape of produce is not relevant, but you must ensure that produce meets or exceeds certain standards. In general it must be sound and in fair condition for marketing purposes. You must also label produce to show its country of origin. If you are a trader in fresh fruit and/or vegetables, any produce that you sell, display or offer for sale, deliver or market must be graded and labelled according to the particular standards that apply to that type of fresh produce. The RPA helps you comply with the law, but may consider prosecution where traders deliberately or persistently do not meet their obligations. Read about horticultural marketing standards on the RPA website . Export procedures for fruit and vegetable farmers Regulations, charges or other restrictions may apply to agriculture and horticulture exports as they leave the UK and/or when they arrive at their destination country. It is important that you research both sides of the transaction. First, you need to classify your goods. Using the standardised classification codes for goods makes it easier to check if any restrictions or charges apply. You can use the UK Trade Tariff to find commodity codes to classify import and export goods. . Export of fruit and vegetables The RPA administers an export refund scheme on added sugar used in the manufacture of certain processed fruit and vegetable products or specific products themselves. RPA also issues licences, which may be required for the payment of export refunds. If you think you may be eligible for refunds, you should contact RPA for more information.

This first ever long-term investment programme will protect 17,134 properties in this region alone and save the national economy £2.7 billion by 2021. The lifetime benefits of this investment will be even higher at over £30bn. New schemes may also be added as the programme progresses. Since the beginning of this parliament flood defence investment has improved protection to over 230,000 homes and over 580,000 acres of land in England. This new investment will protect at least another 300,000 homes by the end of the decade.

/government/news/nuclear-security-mission-to-sellafield-and-barrow-completed,"A team of nuclear security experts led by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has visited the UK to assess civil nuclear security … Nuclear security mission to Sellafield and Barrow completed  Closed organisation: Department of Energy & Climate Change A team of nuclear security experts led by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has visited the UK to assess civil nuclear security arrangements. This follows a commitment made in advance of President Obama’s Nuclear Security Summit in April 2010. The International Physical Protection Advisory Service (IPPAS) Mission assessed the UK’s laws and regulations around nuclear material and nuclear facilities. The Mission Team also assessed compliance with the International Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Materials and the IAEA’s guidelines on nuclear security. The Mission Team visited the Sellafield civil nuclear site and Barrow port, which is used for the transport of civil nuclear material, to see first-hand how these measures are implemented in practice. The IAEA concluded the state of civil nuclear security is sufficiently robust. This is both in the context of the legal and regulatory framework and how this is implemented at the Sellafield site and the Barrow port. Lord Marland of Odstock, Minister for Energy and Climate Change, said: “We are the first nuclear weapons state to open its doors to the international experts to assess our civil nuclear security regime. “This shows the world our commitment to nuclear security and to learning from others. I encourage other countries to follow suit and invite the IAEA to carry out such a mission. “I am grateful for the work of the IAEA and this report from the IPPAS Mission Team, who identified many examples of good practice within the civil nuclear security regime and a number of valuable recommendations and suggestions. “We will work with the nuclear regulator, Sellafield Ltd and the NDA to use this report to ensure that we continue to develop and improve our security regime.” Notes for editors Prime Minister David Cameron endorsed the commitment made by former Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who had invited an IAEA IPPAS mission to Sellafield as part of the UK’s approach to the President Obama-led Nuclear Security Summit held in Washington in April 2010. The objectives of this IPPAS Mission to the UK were to assess the UK’s legal and regulatory framework on the physical protection of nuclear material and nuclear facilities and its compliance with IAEA guidelines, and to see how these measures are implemented at the Sellafield site and at Barrow for the transport of nuclear material. The Mission Team’s work has resulted in a ‘CONFIDENTIAL’ report that contains site-specific information and, for reasons of national security, cannot be made publicly available. However, certain information can be anonymised and used to good effect by being shared and used by the IAEA to develop even better ‘best practice’ worldwide. About 60 IPPAS Missions, over 15 years, have been carried out across the world and all recipients have benefitted from this international advice. UK nuclear security experts from the Office for Nuclear Regulation have been involved in about 20 of these missions. The IPPAS Mission to the UK included representatives from eight different member states (Netherlands, US, Canada, France, Slovenia, Germany, Lithuania and Sweden) with a range of expertise in the various areas related to nuclear security, for example legislative and regulatory practices, physical protection, personal and information security, transport security, security management and culture, policing, and contingency planning."

Oil containment and capture devices have been engineered into the gas venting equipment. “Whilst it’s unlikely there will be further oil loss to the environment, contingency and mitigation measures including surveillance aircraft and at sea counter-pollution equipment will be on scene to detect and also respond as necessary to any sheen. “This operation will not remove any of the trapped oil in the pipeline - that will be the focus of the next phase of the operation. “Over the last 10 days UK Government surveillance aircraft have flown over the Gannet Field and have confirmed that no trace of oil was detected. “The joint DECC and HSE investigation into the cause of the incident continues.”"

/government/case-studies/global-threat-reduction-programme-nuclear-security-programme,"A scheme to improve the security of fissile and other nuclear and radiological materials. Global Threat Reduction Programme: Nuclear Security Programme  Closed organisation: Department of Energy & Climate Change The objective of the Global Threat Reduction Programme ( GTRP ) Nuclear Security Programme is to improve the security of fissile and other nuclear and radiological materials in line with internationally accepted International Atomic Energy Authority ( IAEA ) standards. The Programme supports improvements to the physical protection at vulnerable sites and provides training for security personnel, designed to strengthen security culture and procedures. Physical protection projects in Russia The UK has been supporting improvements to civilian nuclear security infrastructure in Russia for a number of years as part of our contribution to the Global Partnership. Work at Atomflot and four other civilian sites is now complete and GTRP ’s two final physical protection upgrade projects in Russia will complete in 2011. To maximise the sustainability of upgrades, the UK is providing tapered sustainability support for a graduated handover of responsibility for the maintenance and upkeep of UK-funded systems to the site operators. Physical protection projects outside Russia As part of a multinational project to improve the management of disused sealed radioactive sources ( SRS ) in the Ukraine, the UK is leading a joint project with the European Union, to design and build a new secure store for highly active SRS inside the Chernobyl exclusion zone. A contract for the construction of the store has been signed and construction is expected to commence in June 2011. Negotiations for the procurement of equipment are ongoing. Collaboration with the IAEA The UK works closely with the IAEA Office of Nuclear Security to implement a range of projects funded via the UK’s contributions to the IAEA Nuclear Security Fund. GTRP contributed £2 million to the Fund in 2006, £4 million in 2009 and a further £4 million in 2011. Our first major infrastructure project, completed in 2009, provided physical protection upgrades for the radioactive waste facility at the Institute of Nuclear Physics at Alatau, Kazakhstan. A project to upgrade security at the Armenian Nuclear Power Plant was completed in early 2010: one of the largest physical protection projects undertaken to date by the IAEA . A project to improve security infrastructure at a radioactive waste store in Tajikistan is due to complete in 2011. UK funds also provide support to the IAEA ’s global nuclear security training activities. Collaboration with the United States In March 2009, the UK contributed £4 million to the United States National Nuclear Security Administration’s Global Threat Reduction Initiative ( GTRI ) to support specific work identified by the UK as high priority, on radiological and nuclear security, including contributions to GTRI ’s highly enriched uranium minimisation programme. Nuclear security workshops Security culture plays an essential role in underpinning the effectiveness of physical security systems. Complementing UK-funded infrastructure projects, the GTRP nuclear security workshop forms an important component of the Nuclear Security Programme. The workshop draws on IAEA and UK best practice and is run in collaboration with the UK Civil Nuclear Constabulary and Magnox South’s Dungeness site."

The new network - called norstec - was first announced by the Prime Minister at the Clean Energy Ministerial in April and brought together around 20 companies. Today, with its ranks more than doubled and numbers continuing to grow, the network is holding its first full meeting in London centred around this vision and the role that norstec can play in maximising the potential of the northern seas’ abundant resources.   Norstec will communicate the scale of the opportunity and the benefits of clean energy in Europe’s northern seas to the public and the business and political spheres. Signatories will collaborate and share information to ensure that the benefits offered by vast clean energy potential in the Northern Seas are fully realised. Prime Minister, David Cameron, said : “I continue to be strongly supportive of the UK offshore renewables sector and am delighted to see Norstec rising from the waves. As I said when I launched this network last April we are on the cusp of a second, clean energy revolution in the North Sea. Close collaboration between industry and government will be critical to making this happen.” Edward Davey, Energy and Climate Change Secretary, said: “The offshore wind industry represents a massive growth opportunity for the UK and our neighbours around the northern seas, bringing jobs and re-energising once thriving industrial heartlands on the East Coast and beyond. “I am determined that we work closely with North Seas governments, businesses and academics to make the most of our plentiful offshore renewable resources. “Norstec will help the offshore wind industry in the northern seas to grow and create a new industrial revolution, driving economic growth across this part of Europe. I’m delighted to see the potential for offshore wind deployment in the northern seas set out so clearly and vividly.” Notes for editors Read the norstec vision statement Watch the Norstec launch video The Norstec website will be launched on Thursday 4 October.

/government/news/climate-week,"Ministers and senior staff from the Department of Energy & Climate Change last week took part in a series of events to mark Climate Week. Climate Week  Closed organisation: Department of Energy & Climate Change Climate Week & Ecobuild Climate Week partnered with Ecobuild and together they presented Edward Davey with the Climate Week declaration when he attended the Ecobuild trade exhibition at ExCel last Tuesday. Pictures from Ecobuild (Flickr) The Building Centre – Building the “Movement” Edward Davey’s other appearance at this year’s Climate Week was to take part in a very lively discussion on Green Deal at the Building Centre in London. The audience, consisting of community and faith groups, green NGOs, and also architects and builders, was invited by the Secretary of State to discuss ways to engage with the public on energy efficiency. Facing a forest of hands, the Secretary of State called of Tracy Vegro, Green Deal Director, to join him on the platform. Questions ranged from energy efficiency for community centres, to the best messages to communicate. The event was so successful that we are now looking at ways to maintain some form of engagement with the Building centre! Pictures from the event Climate Week and International Women’s Day Baroness Verma visited Manchester on Thursday 7 March for a series of ‘Climate Week’ events. Arndale Centre, Manchester - Carbon Literacy Her first session was the public launch of the Carbon Literacy programme at the Arndale centre. Under this programme, each person living, studying or working in Manchester will get one full day of carbon training before the end of 2014. During the visit, Baroness Verma met several projects taking part in the programme, including the University of Manchester and their Food Journey, Bike Right and their work to get adults cycling with their children, MAES -teaching Carbon Literacy to challenged families, Dwelle’s scale (3m high) Eco-house “dwelleing”, the real version of which is being used as a Carbon Literacy training centre, and the Carbon Classroom, where she sat with children and took part in a lively discussion on climate change! Pictures from the events Manchester BME Network Her second event of the day was with the Manchester BME (black & ethnic minority) Network, where she took part in a discussion hosted at the Wai Yin Women’s Society, meeting several local charities all looking after specific communities and groups and engaging them in being more energy efficient. Baroness Verma stressed the role played by women in these organisations, which was saluted by both the women and men taking part in the discussion. She asked that the organisations stay in contact with her as she is very keen for the learning from this group to be shared more broadly across the country. Smart Meters The last visit of the day – though not entirely under Climate Week auspices but close enough - was with Landis+Gyr, one of the principal manufacturers of Smart Meters. Their management gave Baroness Verma a very good overview of their activities, illustrating the jobs that will be created across the next few years as part of the smart meters roll out, as well the role they play in the regional economy. Following this discussion, Baroness Verma was given a short tour of the factory, where she met with some of the staff, and saw for herself the type of precision work that is required to assemble these devices."

Investigation of the interaction between hot water cylinders, buffer tanks and heat pumps  Closed organisation: Department of Energy & Climate Change The report describes two laboratory tests carried out with two main aims: to investigate the best way to heat domestic hot water tanks with a heat pump to investigate the best way to integrate buffer tanks into a heat pump heating circuit. The domestic hot water study concluded with some recommendations for installers: Low heat pump flow temperatures and low storage temperatures combined with periodic sterilisation give the best system efficiencies. The heat pump output must be higher than the cylinder thermostat set point, to minimise pump on-time and decrease heat loss. Sterilisation should be carried out at night, or during periods of low draw off. Reheat times can be shortened by fitting fast recovery coils, with a higher surface area. The buffer tanks study also concluded with recommendations for installers: In circuits with low central heating volumes, buffer tanks can be helpful to reduce cycling (and its adverse effect on efficiency). If used, a buffer tank should be inserted in a two pipe configuration in the return pipe. Finally, the study concluded that further research is needed into energy-efficient ways of sterilising domestic hot water."

These ERUs can be traded and sold, and used by industrialized countries to a meet a part of their emission reduction targets under the Kyoto Protocol. Joint implementation offers Parties a flexible and cost-efficient means of fulfilling a part of their Kyoto commitments, while the host Party benefits from foreign investment and technology transfer. A designated focal point (DFP) is the organization granted responsibility by a Party to the Kyoto Protocol to authorise and approve participation in JI projects. DFP project approval is just one of the steps required of JI projects in the project cycle. For further information on the JI process please refer to the UNFCCC JI website . Since June 1, 2011 the Environment Agency has served as the UK’s DFP for JI and issues the letters of approval for voluntary participation in the scheme. The Government does not approve JI projects hosted in the UK, but can issue letters of approval to UK companies wishing to participate in JI projects overseas. Guidance documents linked to this page apply to the UK approval and authorisation of JI projects under Article 6 of the Kyoto Protocol and which occur in countries other than the UK (the Government is not currently approving JI projects hosted in the UK).

Microgeneration Strategy Industry Action Plan Final Report  Closed organisation: Department of Energy & Climate Change This is a report on the implementation of the Microgeneration Strategy Industry Action Plan – a two-year programme of action to tackle non-financial barriers facing small-scale renewable and low carbon energy technologies. The Microgeneration Government-Industry Contact Group provided oversight and coordination of the implementation of the action plan. The Government is committed to development of the microgeneration market and wants to see wider take up of renewable and low carbon technologies. These technologies present an opportunity for consumers to generate their own electricity and heat. Combined with reducing energy through support of the Green Deal, consumers can take steps to not only reduce the environmental impact of heating and powering their homes but also to reduce energy bills. The Final Report sets out the actions that have been completed to develop the supply chain to ensure we make the most of the domestic Renewable Heat Incentive which is due to start in the Spring 2014. In terms of micro-electricity, we have already seen a transformation, particularly in the solar PV sector, because of the success of the Feed-In Tariffs. Implementation of Microgeneration Strategy Action Plan has been driven by the ‘Microgeneration Government Industry Contact Group’. This work is an example of Government and industry working in partnership to make a real difference to the development of sector."

/government/publications/usability-testing-of-smarter-heating-controls,"The report tests the usability of five smarter heating controls to gain insight into the potential for smarter heating controls to save energy. Usability testing of smarter heating controls  Closed organisation: Department of Energy & Climate Change DECC has set up a programme of work to understand the potential for smarter heating controls to save energy. As part of this DECC wished to gain insight into the usability of smarter heating controls to understand their suitability for future trials. DECC is interested in whether smarter heating controls have the capacity to support energy saving behaviours, but foresee a prerequisite of this is the ability of smarter heating controls to support easy use by consumers. The study reports usability testing of five currently available smarter heating controls in a simulated home environment with 72 participants. Results, presently anonymously in the report, show that none of the controls met the benchmarks for effectiveness (completion of tasks), satisfaction (ease of completing tasks) or the industry standard subjective assessment for how easy the controls were to use overall. Three of the controls met the benchmark for efficiency (how long users spent attempting the tasks) indicating that users could complete tasks within a reasonable or desirable time for a number of controls. A number of barriers to use were inferred through observation of participant behaviours and their subjective comments regarding the controls. These included: complex set-up of schedules; lack of error prevention; unclear icons and text labels; visual design issues; difficulties in identifying the status of controls; and lack of confirmatory feedback. Participant demographic data was analysed as a potential factor underlying the relative usability of the smarter heating controls. It was found that usability issues may be more prevalent among older people, those less familiar with smart phones, and users with dexterity or vision impairments. The report concludes that these findings have implications for the potential users and manufacturers of smarter heating controls as well as for DECC. Difficulty in using current space heating controls may present a barrier to people who wish to save energy. The perceived difficulty in using smarter heating controls may also pose a substantive motivational barrier to the uptake of energy saving behaviours, even if controls are installed in a person’s home. There is a need for innovation around the usability of controls in order to address the current barriers to use. A number of recommendations are provided to highlight opportunities for manufacturers and DECC to improve the usability of smarter heating controls.

/government/publications/what-people-want-from-their-heating-controls-a-qualitative-study,"The report gathers requirements for smarter heating controls by studying how people use their existing heating controls. What people want from their heating controls: a qualitative study  Closed organisation: Department of Energy & Climate Change The Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) has set up a programme of work to understand the potential for smarter heating controls to save energy. As part of this DECC wished to understand what people need from their heating controls so as to improve their understanding of how emerging technologies could best meet these needs. This research gathered requirements for smarter heating controls by studying how people use their existing heating controls. The study found that a number of factors influenced behavior such as functionality, usability and accessibility; beliefs and understanding around efficient use of heating; awareness of the cost implications of different behaviours; and a tension between comfort and spend. It also found that participants broadly fell into the following five user types: Rationers, Ego-centric, Hands off, Planners and Reactors. The key requirements for heating controls were the ability to monitor spending on heating, control the temperature at different times in different rooms from one panel, turn the heating on before getting home and to see the current state of the heating system in different parts of the home. Implications for smarter heating controls are that participants were interested in minimising waste but were not always sure how to achieve this. Analysis of ‘wasteful’ behaviours suggested that automation could help minimise waste, but it was relatively unpopular. Participants wanted more rather than less active involvement in their heating, with a greater degree of control. A key future requirement of smarter heating controls would allow users to monitor the spending consequences of their use of heating and make informed decisions accordingly. Analysis also suggested that remote and zonal control of smarter heating controls could be combined with optional automation to build trust. More information can be found on the Smarter Heating Controls Research Programme page."

/government/news/new-projects-pass-first-hurdle-to-secure-government-guarantee-for-infrastructure,"Energy, road and rail projects worth £33 billion pass 'first hurdle' in getting a government infrastructure guarantee. New projects pass ‘first hurdle’ to secure government guarantee for infrastructure  Closed organisation: Infrastructure UK HM Treasury Closed organisation: Department of Energy & Climate Change Energy, road and rail projects worth £33 billion have passed the first hurdle in getting a government infrastructure guarantee Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander has announced today (21 October). Forty projects are now at the stage known as pre-qualification, meaning that they are eligible for the UK Guarantee scheme. Over half that have pre-qualified are energy projects, helping ensure that Britain develops a sustainable future energy supply. While further discussions, assessment and due diligence remain, the move could see them secure government agreement to act as a guarantor for a project, giving private lenders confidence that they will get their money back if the project cannot pay. If the government gave a guarantee it would be for a proportion of the capital value of the project, and the scheme is authorised to issue up to £40 billion of guarantees in total. Of the £40 billion of guarantees available, the government has already awarded a £75 million guarantee to power plant Drax for their £700 million programme to partially convert the UK’s biggest coal power station to biomass. The power station will produce 7% of the UK’s electricity with the biomass conversions set to be up and running over the next 3 years. 17 of the pre-qualified projects have agreed to be named. The new pre-qualified projects named today are: Helius Energy - Avonmouth biomass energy generation is a 100MW capacity facility in the South West expected to produce energy for the national grid, costing around £300 million to construct and creating approximately 450 full time jobs during the construction phase Islandmagee gas storage project in Northern Ireland worth £400 million which will be capable of storing up two month’s worth of Northern Ireland’s total gas requirement two Intergen gas-fired power generation projects at Spalding in Lincolnshire and Gateway Energy Centre in Essex, the latter being an investment of £600 million Countesswells mixed use development in Aberdeen, Scotland which will see 3000 new homes built alongside business spaces and retail outlets Neart Na Gaoithe 450MW Windfarm in the outer Forth Estuary, Scotland Able Marine Energy Park, a port facility to support the manufacture, assembly and installation of offshore renewable technologies on Humberside Chinook Energy plants, producing renewable energy from waste at sites around the UK Gasrec, a producer and distributor of new, low carbon Bio-LNG fuel for UK commercial vehicle fleets University of Roehampton campus redevelopment in South London Tilbury Green Power 60MW waste wood fired power generation plant in Essex relocation of University of Northampton from its current campus into Northampton Enterprise Zone Five-Quarter Energy plant to process unconventional gas extracted from below the North Sea to create low-cost energy for British manufacturing and new jobs in the north-east of England Ineos Grangemouth Ethane Plant near Falkirk, Scotland– a project to build ethane importation and storage facilities Eggborough Power Limited conversion of coal-fired power station to biomass View a full table of projects pre-qualified for the UK Guarantees scheme Already announced as pre-qualified: Northern Line Extension – UK Guarantee will be provided to support up to £1 billion of borrowing by the Greater London Authority for the Northern Line Extension to Battersea scheme Mersey Gateway – a guarantee to support the construction of a bridge to relieve congestion and improve road transport links in the north-west of England Hinkley C nuclear power – the first new nuclear power plant to be built in Britain in a generation, a £16 billion investment In April 2013 a guarantee for £75 million was issued to Drax Power for the partial conversion of their coal-fired power station to biomass The guarantees are one option for projects to use when financing themselves - many are also in discussion with private lenders. The pre-qualification means that should efforts to secure private finance fail, the government is there to help. Government guarantees are offered on commercial terms so involve a fee which is based on the riskiness of the project. Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Rt Hon. Danny Alexander MP said: Getting our infrastructure right means we can be globally competitive, boost growth and create jobs across the UK. What we see today is the extent to which the government is reaching out to help the private sector build Britain’s key infrastructure. Having passed the first hurdle these companies know the government is there to help if they need it. I hope today’s announcement will encourage even more businesses to consider how they can take advantage of a guarantee. Find out what else the government is doing to support and grow the UK economy The scheme is open to major infrastructure in sectors such as energy, transport, communications, waste and housing that are seen as growth boosting projects that will help support the local and national economy."

/guidance/export-of-nuclear-equipment-material-and-technology-trigger-list-requirements,"Guidance if exporting certain types of controlled sensitive nuclear items on what is known as the 'Trigger List'. Export of nuclear equipment, material and technology: 'Trigger List' requirements  Export Control Organisation Closed organisation: Department of Energy & Climate Change Department for International Trade Overview The Export Control Organisation ( ECO ) is responsible for legislating, assessing and issuing export licences for a wide variety of controlled goods. One particular category of controlled goods which requires an export licence is nuclear equipment, material and technology. This guidance is for exporters who want to export certain types of sensitive nuclear items which are detailed in what is known as the Nuclear Suppliers Group ( NSG ) ‘Trigger List’, so called because exports of such material triggers the requirement for safeguards. This guide explains how the ECO , together with the Nuclear Unit - Non Proliferation ( NU-NP ) team in the Department of Energy and Climate Change ( DECC ), assess these applications and sets out the important factors that exporters should bear in mind when applying for a licence. This information is for guidance only. It is not a statement of law. Before exporting you should refer to the legal provisions in force at the time. Where legal advice is required exporters should make their own arrangements. Assurances needed for sensitive nuclear items and what exporters should do Nuclear export controls outline the kind of sensitive items that can be exported or transferred internationally. International nuclear exports depend upon recipient countries meeting certain security standards and safeguards, and pre-notification or assurance of a proposed export. This is the case in particular for nuclear items - equipment, material or technology - which are listed on what is known as the NSG Trigger List. What is the NSG ? The NSG is one of the international regimes or groups which impact upon national export controls of most industrialised countries, including those of the UK. The NSG consists of over 40 nuclear supplier countries, including the UK, and seeks to control nuclear exports in order to aid non-proliferation, without hindering international nuclear trade and cooperation. It achieves this via the implementation of guidelines. For further details about the NSG , read about international non-proliferation and arms control regimes . What is the Trigger List? The so-called NSG Trigger List is a list of certain types of sensitive nuclear items. This list is one of two lists published by the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ). Download the NSG Part 1 Trigger List guidelines from the IAEA website . Background on the role of the ECO and DECC and the export of sensitive nuclear items NU-NP , which is based within DECC , deals with non-proliferation work including nuclear safeguards matters, and implementation and verification in the UK of relevant international regimes and conventions, including the IAEA . The ECO is responsible for issuing export licences for controlled goods. They and the NU-NP frequently work behind the scenes to obtain specific Government-to-Government Assurances on many NSG Trigger List items before an export licence can be issued. What is the Government-to-Government Assurance? An Assurance is a formal undertaking issued by one government to another. There are three forms of Assurance for exporters: a full Government-to-Government Assurance a European Union Intra-Community Assurance known as a POCO a Confirmatory Note All three require a formal diplomatic exchange. In principle an Assurance is similar to an End-User Undertaking ( EUU ). For more information, see the guide on end-user and stockist undertakings for SIELs and consignee undertakings for OIELs . The key difference with an EUU , however, is that an Assurance binds the issuing government to agreed non-proliferation measures, for instance, those stated in the NSG Part 1 Trigger List guidelines or the terms and conditions stated in existing bilateral or multilateral treaties. What should exporters do to meet the Trigger List requirements? Given the pre-requirements necessary internationally for the sensitive nuclear items concerned, it is vital for any exporters exporting any listed items to provide all the facts, clearly, when the application is first made. This includes providing the following exact details: the name of the end-user(s) the use to which the equipment, material or technology will be put exactly what is being exported, including specific quantity and weight full details of any consignees or agents involved proposed shipment dates Almost all queries raised by the ECO concern the quantities of material or shipping dates on the licence application, which turn out not to match the details the importer enters on his or her EUU . You should also allow plenty of time to sort out an Assurance. For more information, see the sections in this guide on factors to consider in obtaining an Assurance and applying for a licence for sensitive nuclear items. Why and when Assurances are needed for exporting sensitive nuclear items A fundamental part of the international nuclear non-proliferation infrastructure is the requirement for Assurances to be given before the export of certain types of sensitive nuclear material, equipment and technology is authorised. The principle behind this requirement is that notifications of particularly sensitive exports for nuclear End-Use are conveyed directly between governments so that the legitimacy of the proposed export and End-Use can be verified. Essentially, any item included on the NSG Trigger List may be subject to an Assurance, which must be in place before the ECO can approve and issue an export licence. The underlying requirements for each type of Assurance are derived from the following international agreements and commitments: Government-to-Government Assurances ( GTGAs ) come from the NSG Part 1 Trigger List Guidelines EU Intra-Community Assurance or POCO is stipulated in the EU Declaration of Common Policy for nuclear transfers the need for Confirmatory Notes is stated in many of the bilateral/multilateral Nuclear Co-operation ‘Peaceful Use’ agreements which we have with other countries, such as the Australia/EURATOM Agreement Download the NSG Part 1 Trigger List guidelines from the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) website . You can read the EU Declaration of Common Policy for nuclear transfers on the IAEA website . When Assurances are needed Not all transfers of Trigger List items will require an Assurance. However there are several policy and treaty requirements that must be taken into consideration for each export and, only after examining the details of the items to be exported, the weight/quantity concerned, the intended End-Use, the country and End-User location, will the ECO , together with the DECC , be able to determine whether an Assurance is required. The underlying requirement for a GTGA comes from the NSG Part 1 Trigger List Guidelines, where the Guidelines for nuclear transfers, stipulates: “Suppliers [States] should authorize [issue licences for the] transfer of items or related technology identified in the trigger list only upon formal governmental assurances from recipients explicitly excluding the uses which would result in any nuclear explosive device.” However, some items covered by the Trigger List are accompanied by conditions which must be met for an item to be classified as a Trigger List export. For example, nuclear grade graphite is included on the list but it is only classified as a Trigger List export (and therefore requiring Assurances), when it is being used within a nuclear reactor. Mitigating some of the GTGA requirements stated in the NSG Part 1 Trigger List Guidelines are a number of bilateral and multilateral international nuclear co-operation Peaceful Use agreements or treaties. The UK is a party to a large number of these treaties, the intent of which is to facilitate nuclear trade by having pre-agreed measures and requirements that will apply to transfers between countries. However, the terms and coverage vary and many treaties stipulate the requirement for a Confirmatory Note, in other words, an exchange between countries to confirm that the transfer of items will fall under the terms of the treaty in question. For EU intra-community transfers, the EU Declaration of Common Policy - which underlines the EU free trade principle - further mitigates the need for a POCO Assurance except for certain quantities of both high enriched uranium (material with an isotopic rating of U235 of 20 per cent or higher) and plutonium. When an EUU is required for sensitive nuclear items Where a GTGA , POCO or Confirmatory Note is needed, you will not also need to obtain an EUU from your customer. However, you should remember that for EU intra-community transfers, a POCO is only needed for certain quantities of high enriched uranium and plutonium. So although for all other intra-community transfers of Trigger List items, a POCO is not required, an EUU will be. Where to get an EUU In the great majority of cases the End-User will be self-evident. However, this is not always the case, and there have been instances in which the UK and other governments have adopted different interpretations. The problem area is where a UK exporter is transferring nuclear fuel to a fuel fabricator, or similar, who then repackages the fuel into rods, or similar, and sells it to the final user, often a power plant. The UK has taken the view that the fuel fabricator receives the material in the state that it left the UK and is, therefore, responsible for providing an EUU where one is needed. However, some other countries have taken the view that the input of the fuel fabricator is insignificant and that, in reality, the power plant is the End-User. These are legitimate differences of interpretation and so the ECO is prepared to allow a degree of flexibility. From their perspective it is more important that they are made aware of exactly what is happening (in other words, who is initially receiving the fuel, what they are doing to it and where it is then going to be sent) than the format of the document. Therefore, you should ask for the EUU to be provided by whoever initially uses the product in the state in which it left the UK. However, if you encounter problems or reluctance to provide this Undertaking, please contact the named Case Officer in the ECO ’s Licensing Unit, who, in liaison with the NU-NP within DECC , will see if an alternative solution can be found. For more information on the requirements of EUUs, including a template EUU to be completed by your End-User, see our guide on end-user and stockist undertakings for SIELs and consignee undertakings for OIELs . The export licence application process for sensitive nuclear items You can apply for an export licence using SPIRE. A licence application will first be assessed against the UK Strategic Export Control Lists and NSG regulations to determine under what part of the controls the goods, material or technology are licensable and whether they fall under the NSG Trigger List. If this is the case, the NU-NP within DECC will then draft the request for the Assurance. This will include information on: the exporter any consignee(s) or agent(s) involved the End-User(s) the stated End-Use(s) a full item description - including quantity/weight proposed shipment dates This will then be passed to the British Embassy in the recipient country who pass the request to the respective country’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs who, in turn, will pass the request to whichever organisation has responsibility for providing the Assurance. At the same time, the ECO will seek advice from its advisors in other UK government departments, in accordance with normal procedures. The responsible organisation in the recipient country may need to make enquiries with its nuclear regulatory body, the import licensing body and the commercial companies involved (consignees, agents and end-users) and, only when the responsible organisation is satisfied that the items will be used as stated, and that these items are adequately protected and safeguarded, will an Assurance be issued. Unresolved queries will usually be passed back for the ECO or the NU-NP to take up with the UK exporter. For more information, see the guides on the export control licensing process and how to appeal  and the  UK Strategic Export Control Lists - the consolidated list of strategic military and dual-use items . Factors to consider in obtaining an Assurance and applying for a licence for sensitive nuclear items The Assurance sought will cover the specific export detailed on the licence application - in other words, it will cover the transfer of the exact quantity of items within the anticipated validity period of the export licence. If a licence needs to be amended - for instance, in terms of quantities increased or the lifetime extended - then a new Assurance will need to be sought. Timescales for obtaining an Assurance There are no target times set within the existing guidelines and treaties. In practice, countries will process Assurance requests as quickly as possible, but remember that a reasonable amount of time is needed to allow the necessary enquiries. Even with email and fax, the chain of parties involved in passing the request to the organisation responsible for issuing the Assurance will inevitably slow things down, particularly given different time zones, working hours and national holidays. The complexity of the proposed transfer will be a significant factor. For instance, a Standard Individual Export Licence ( SIEL ) covering a single shipment to a single End-User will usually be quicker to process than an Open Individual Export Licence ( OIEL ) covering multiple shipments to multiple End-Users. Another significant factor will be the available resources of the recipient government. Countries with a well-developed nuclear industry often have a dedicated office for processing requests of this nature and the turnaround time of Assurances is usually two to three weeks. However, other countries without such resources may take considerably longer to process the request. The following table shows the average turnaround time for the countries to which the UK frequently exports. Country Approximate length of turnaround time (months) Brazil 6 plus Canada 6 plus Japan 3 People’s Republic of China 6 Russian Federation 3 plus South Africa 6 plus United States of America 3 The figures are based on recent exchanges, and show the time elapsed between the request being sent to the UK embassy abroad and a reply being received. Timescales for applying for an export licence The timescales set out above are averages - they are not a guarantee that any export licence will be granted within a specified timescale. However, if you are applying for a SIEL for the relevant material to the above countries, you should always factor in the time taken. If you are applying for an OIEL , you should always apply six months in advance of the date of shipment, or, where applicable, the date of expiry of your current OIEL . This latter consideration is particularly important because where Government-to-Government Assurances are involved, an existing OIEL cannot be extended until a new OIEL can be put in place. This is because Assurances are only valid for the anticipated life of the original OIEL , and so the ECO will need to seek new Assurances for any exports after that date.

/government/news/uk-us-and-eu-sign-landmark-deal-to-turn-nuclear-material-into-cancer-fighting-treatment,"The Prime Minister will announce an agreement on a multilateral swap of nuclear material that will help to diagnose and treat cancer. UK, US and EU sign landmark deal to turn nuclear material into cancer-fighting treatment  Prime Minister's Office, 10 Downing Street Foreign & Commonwealth Office Closed organisation: Department of Energy & Climate Change Britain is set to agree a landmark deal with the United States and European Union on a multilateral swap of nuclear material that could ensure a continued supply into the UK of rare materials to diagnose and treat cancer. Under the agreement, which will be announced by the Prime Minister at the Nuclear Security Summit in Washington later today, the UK will transfer around 700 kilograms of excess Highly Enriched Uranium ( HEU ) from the Dounreay nuclear site on the north coast of Scotland to the US. As the largest ever single move of HEU , the transfer will reduce Britain’s overall stockpile of nuclear material. In exchange, the US will send a different type of HEU to the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) in France, where it will be converted into medical isotopes. These can be used in radiotherapy to diagnose and treat conditions such as thyroid cancer by weakening or destroying the cancerous cells. The isotopes could then be exported to the UK and other European countries to help fight the disease. Speaking ahead of the Nuclear Security Summit, the Prime Minister said: This is a landmark deal to turn nuclear material we no longer need into a cancer-fighting treatment that could potentially save many lives. It’s a win-win, innovative solution that shows what working together with our international partners can achieve. The Prime Minister is also set to announce a joint UK-US exercise next year to test the security of civil nuclear infrastructure in the face of a major cyber attack. Building on last year’s Operation Resilient Shield which explored our responses to potential cyber attacks on the countries’ biggest banks, this exercise will test the response of the UK and US governments and nuclear industries to a cyber assault on the civil nuclear sector. The exercise will simulate a cyber attack on nuclear power supplies to see how Britain and America can work together in the event of such a security threat. Britain, a world leader in civil nuclear security, will also use the summit to launch a scheme that will strengthen other countries’ abilities to withstand cyber attacks at nuclear sites and power plants. Countries including Japan, Argentina, the Republic of Korea and Turkey have signed up to a series of workshops hosted by the UK this year to examine the threats facing the sector and the best way to protect it."

It also allows teams to identify assumptions which may carry higher risk. A good assumptions log will help models score highly on the criteria linked to Data & Assumptions in DECC’s Quality Assurance log. This assumptions log template is used by model-owners within DECC, and it should also be used for all new models which are procured by DECC. Logging assumptions correctly is an important part of the Quality Assurance of any model. It ensures that there is a clear justification for decisions made about which data and methodologies are used in model. An assumption might be a number (e.g. a historical data point or series, a projected data point or series, a conversion or efficiency factor, a technology parameter) or a methodological assumption (e.g. a method for extrapolation, a behavioural assumption, a statistical assumption, a choice of calculation methodology)."

/government/case-studies/sellafield-remotely-operated-unmanned-aerial-vehicle-combined-with-radiation-mapping-software,"Riser (Remote Intelligence Survey Equipment for Radiation) reduces dose to operators and effectively characterises historic facilities to enable decommissioning progress. Sellafield: remotely operated unmanned aerial vehicle combined with radiation mapping software  Innovate UK Closed organisation: Department of Energy & Climate Change Nuclear Decommissioning Authority Background The 1957 fire at Sellafield’s Windscale Pile left radioactive contamination levels too high for decommissioning work to start. Although the intervening years have reduced these levels, remotely operated equipment is still needed to establish how the chimney can be cleaned out and dismantled. Challenge Accessing a high-dose environment and securing accurate information on contamination distribution Solution Remotely operated unmanned aerial vehicle combined with radiation mapping software Technology Remote Intelligence Survey Equipment for Radiation (Riser) Benefits Reduction in dose to operators from remote technology, effective characterisation of a historic facility to enable decommissioning to progress Status Deployed on site Delivery partners Sellafield Ltd Blue Bear Systems Research Ltd Createc RISER - a step change in UAS capability - from Createc and Blue Bear Systems Solution The lightweight Riser (Remote Intelligence Survey Equipment for Radiation) system that combines 2 separate pieces of technology, drones and radiation mapping software. Both technologies received R&D funding through different routes. In 2012, a UK-wide government initiative was launched by Innovate UK, the NDA, Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) plus the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC). Worth £18 million in total, the investment aimed to encourage companies, especially smaller businesses, from across the nuclear sector and beyond to collaborate on innovative ideas for potential industrial deployment. The funds matched investment by private sector organisations. The money was shared among a wide range of projects at varying levels of development, covering all aspects of the nuclear sector. The development of Riser, which built on the early NDA investment in N-Visage TM , illustrates 2 of the routes that can encourage technological development: support at the early concept stage – from NDA’s R&D portfolio support for potential collaboration with other relevant technologies – from co-funded government initiatives including NDA’s funding ongoing support to explore how a technology can be deployed at site level - from Site Licence Companies (SLCs) as potential end-users In 2009, Createc’s N-Visage TM radiation mapping software project received a £50,000 investment from the NDA, enabling continuing development during the critical early stages. Three years later, the NDA was part of a joint investment by government organisations in a wide range of UK nuclear R&D projects. This led to the collaboration between Createc and aerial systems specialist Blue Bear, together with on-site trials at Sellafield - and Riser was the result. N-Visage TM ’s tailor-made technology detects and maps radiation with pinpoint accuracy, producing a 3D high-definition picture of contamination, quickly and safely. Developed and exhaustively tested over a number of years, the compact, lightweight N-Visage TM system has already been used inside one of the reactor buildings at Japan’s Fukushima plant. The system is compact, lightweight and can be deployed though small openings, in tight spaces and in high-dose environments. Dose to operators is reduced as the technology is remotely deployed. After many trials, Riser was deployed in the Windscale Pile where it has provided hugely valuable information about internal contamination that will enable decommissioning plans to be drawn up. The drone, or unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), is less than one metre in diameter and navigates using its ‘collision avoidance’ capability. Able to manoeuvre accurately inside complex industrial spaces, data is transmitted to the mapping system and is displayed, highlighting areas of contamination as well as radiation levels."

A molecular approach to detect hybridisation between crucian carp and non indigenous carp species in UK waters, including a consideration of the taxon  Environment Agency The Crucian carp (Carassius carassius) is a medium sized cyprinid fish which mainly inhabits small still waters. There is now a strong, but as yet unsubstantiated belief that this native species is under increasing threat from hybridisation, competition and disease from other closely related nonnative fishes such as common carp (Cyprinus carpio) and goldfish (Carassius auratus). These threats are considered to be Europe-wide and are compounded by difficulties in identification of pure-bred C. carassius and hybrids by external morphological investigation and by some unresolved taxonomic problems. Of particular note is the species in Europe commonly known as the “gibel” or “prussian” carp. It has long been discussed but is still not known whether this is a species in its own right, a subspecies of the goldfish or whether it may be of hybrid origin."

/government/news/environment-agency-finishes-repairs-to-preston-beach-sea-defences,"It's taken five weeks of intensive work to restore the sea defences damaged by the severe winter storms at Preston Beach, east of Weymouth. Environment Agency finishes repairs to Preston Beach sea defences  Environment Agency During a series of severe storms in early January and February 2014 the Preston Beach Sea Defence Scheme took a pounding and lost so much of its shingle in front of the promenade that the sea wall was in danger of breaching or being overtopped by large waves. Completed in 1996 to offer protection to the A353 and some 30 properties at Lodmoor and Overcombe, the scheme has a promenade and sea wall, fronted by imported shingle which acts as a buffer to wave energy. A number of severe flood warnings were issued in the New Year due to the loss of beach material during previous storms and the ability of waves to run up and over the sea wall. The road has been closed at these times to avoid risk to life from waves laden with shingle hitting vehicles. The local Environment Agency operations teams were supported by staff from the Midlands Region during January to recover material between the storms which has been lost off the beach. This work has had to be repeated several times up until the extreme storm on 5 February. The beach was reduced to no crest and foundations in front of the promenade were exposed. The Environment Agency mobilised a contractor to carry out emergency reinforcement of the beach crest using rocks from Portland placed under the shingle down the beach in front of the promenade to protect the foundations and the integrity of the scheme. “The work involved burying limestone boulders up to six tonnes in weight within the beach over a length of 350 metres to ensure a permanent crest in front of the sea wall. Around 3,955 tonnes of rock was placed under the shingle to maintain the crest width during future storms,” said Neil Watson for the Environment Agency. The Environment Agency held a well-attended local meeting on 26 February to explain the emergency works and future commitments to monitoring and improvements.

Leicester flood risk management scheme plans showcased at public drop-in event  Environment Agency The 1pm to 8pm event at Abbey Pumping Station Museum on Corporation Road, Leicester, was jointly organised by the Environment Agency and Leicester City Council. The key objective of the Leicester flood risk management scheme is to reduce flood risk from river and surface water flooding and is a joint initiative between the Environment Agency and Leicester City Council. Construction of the first phase is expected next year. A significant area of Leicester is at risk of flooding from the River Soar or nearby smaller watercourses. In November 2012, large parts of the city narrowly avoided flooding, but we need to plan for the future. The project will also help to release the economic potential of brown field sites currently at significant risk of flooding, whilst improving the public open spaces alongside the river. As part of the project, the Environment Agency carried out a four week programme of exploratory ground investigations in January. This exercise allowed the project team to understand the makeup of the ground along the River Soar. The ground investigations were just part of a series of surveys and investigations which were undertaken to help shape the project. Environment Agency Project Manager Charles Chandler said: “It has been a really exciting and marvellous opportunity so far to work on this new plan for Leicester. Together with partners Leicester City Council, we’re continuing to develop a holistic approach to reducing flood risk for the local community, which ultimately will help deliver wider economic and environmental benefits.” Leicester City Council’s Head of Highways Martin Fletcher said: “We are pleased to be a partner in this project and that we have been able to recommend this site for flood risk management work around wetland and conservation. It’s great that the Environment Agency has chosen to put its energy and resources into reducing the risk of flooding to homes and businesses in the city, as well as improving the riverside environment. We will continue to work closely with our Environment Agency colleagues to deliver these improvements.” More information about the Leicester flood risk management scheme"
/government/news/kayaker-caught-poaching-on-devon-river,"Beverley Nicholls concealed bass and trout in his kayak after netting them during an illegal fishing spree on the River Taw in north Devon. Kayaker caught poaching on Devon river Fisheries and rod licensing Environment Agency A court heard how a Barnstaple man caught more than 20 fish during an illegal fishing spree on the River Taw in North Devon. Beverley Nicholls concealed bass and trout in his kayak after netting them early one evening last summer. The paddling poacher was caught after a member of the public saw him using a net at Runsam Bridge and reported the sighting to the Environment Agency. Two fishery officers were quickly at the scene and saw the defendant fishing from his canoe. When they called to him to ask if he’d caught anything, Nicholls replied ‘only a couple of bass.’ One of the officers suggested he returned the fish to the water unharmed as he was in a bass nursery area. He asked Nicholls to haul in his net so he could check and make sure it was legal. It contained four mullet and a bass. The officer told the defendant he was going to search his boat and asked him to get out. Nicholls tried to paddle away. The officer then waded into the river and grabbed the cock-pit of the canoe to stop him escaping. At one point Nicholls tried to push the officer away with his paddle. He was warned he was at risk of being reported for obstruction. The canoe was brought ashore and the defendant asked to empty the boat of fish. When one of the fisheries officers checked inside the canoe he found a large bass that Nicholls had tried to hide. He was allowed to keep the mullet as netting this species within a bass nursery area is permitted. A court heard how a Barnstaple man caught more than 20 fish during an illegal fishing spree on the River Taw in North Devon. Beverley Nicholls concealed bass and trout in his kayak after netting them early one evening last summer. The total number of fish recovered included three bass, five rainbow trout, a brown trout, a sea trout and 12 mullet. The sea trout (3lb) alone was worth approximately £30. Nicholls, who lives on a houseboat in Barnstaple, said he knew there was a bass nursery area on the River Torridge, but didn’t realise it extended to the Taw estuary. It is illegal to fish for bass from a boat within the tidal limits of the Taw estuary from the site of the old power station at Yelland to a point upstream at New Bridge between May 1 – October 31. A net limitation order is in place on the Taw and Torridge estuary to protect salmon and sea trout on their migration from the sea to their spawning grounds. Paul Carter for the Environment Agency said: Bass nurseries help safeguard stocks so it is important fishing from boats is restricted in these areas. The defendant has an excellent knowledge of the Taw and Torridge and is aware of local restrictions. On this occasion he chose to break the law and was caught. Appearing before Barnstaple magistrates, Beverley Nicholls, was given a 12 month conditional discharge and ordered to pay £200 costs after pleading guilty to illegally fishing for bass and sea trout at Runsam Bridge on the River Taw on June 4, 2013. His net was confiscated. The case was the first joint prosecution ever taken in the south west by the Inshore Fisheries Conservation Authority (IFCA) and the Environment Agency. It was heard on Tuesday (April 8). Members of the public can report illegal fishing and other environmental crimes by calling the Environment Agency’s free 24-hour hotline 0800 80 70 60. ENDS"

/government/news/lincolnshire-beach-restoration-begins-following-tidal-surge,"Lincshore, the flagship scheme to reduce flood risk to thousands of homes and businesses on the Lincolnshire coast began at Boygrift today.  Lincolnshire beach restoration begins following tidal surge  Environment Agency The Environment Agency scheme played a vital role in helping to protect Lincolnshire’s coastal communities from flooding during December’s tidal surge. This year’s campaign will cost £8.4 million - an increase of £2.4 million on the usual £6-million. Extra money has been needed this year because repairs have also taken place to sand dunes damaged by December’s tidal surge. Mark Adams, Coastal Engineer, said: December’s tidal surge reminded us that if defences along the beaches which rely on Lincshore failed, tens of thousands of homes and businesses would be at severe risk of flooding. The scheme did what it was supposed to do against a surge higher than that experienced in 1953. It held up well and protected thousands of properties on the Lincolnshire coast as well as a number of important environmental sites. Lincshore began in 1994 and covers beaches between Mablethorpe and Skegness. The scheme maintains protection against a one in 200 year tidal flood (0.5%) for 30,000 properties and 35,000 hectares of land. Lincshore works by increasing the level of the beach to reduce the risk of waves reaching the main defences and going over the seawalls. It protects the clay foreshore against further erosion and prevents rapid deterioration of the defences. The Environment Agency scheme also benefits tourism – without it, Lincolnshire’s beaches would be reduced to their clay base. Mark said: We time our works to minimise disruption to local communities and visitors but unfortunately some inconvenience is unavoidable as we will need to close off sections of beach while we work on them to keep people safe. Lincshore maintains a vital part of Lincolshire’s coastal flood defences and we hope people understand why we need to carry out this work at this time of year. The scheme will see 520,000m³ cubic metres of sand pumped from licensed off-shore sites onto 20km of beach, including Boygrift, Trusthorpe, Sutton on Sea, Chapel Six Marshes, Ingoldmells, Trunch Lane, Huttoft and Moggs Eye. The dredger Breughel, which was named after the famous Belgian Northern Renaissance painter, is being used. It has a hopper capacity of 11,650 cubic metres and can carry 18,710 tonnes of sand. It has a 1,200mm dredging pipe and can dredge at depths down to 43 metres. It also has the lowest carbon footprint in its class. The Environment Agency is currently reviewing how the risk of coastal flooding and erosion between Saltfleet and Gibraltar Point will continue to be managed in future. By working with partners, local communities and businesses, the review will consider a range of options including beach nourishment and installing groynes before it identifies a preferred approach. Lincshore offers the coast an excellent standard of protection but people living and working in coastal communities should take steps to ensure they know what to do in an emergency.

Aimed at helping businesses identify the commercial benefits of being resource efficient, the conference will cover energy, water, waste, materials and environmental management. It is being held at the Kingsgate Centre in Peterborough on Tuesday 20 May but businesses must book their place by 12 May. Some of the topics that will be covered include: Why all businesses need to tackle resource efficiency today Simple steps to save money on energy & water How to reduce waste going to landfill What grants and financial incentives are available to help reduce costs Helping to get the messages across will be Amazon explorer Ed Stafford as well as other speakers from Defra, the Chartered Institution for Wastes Management and Waterwise. Insight and Advice Through a mixture of presentations, workshops and case studies, delegates will hear from knowledgeable individuals offering insight, advice and practical tips about how to improve resource efficiency. Delegates will also have the opportunity to meet organisations offering support, both practical and financial, to tackle the issues being addressed. DEFRA estimates that companies in the East could benefit from over £300m of savings a year by investing time and resources into lowering energy use alone. However, businesses face a number of barriers that prevent them making these operational changes, not least accessing the knowledge that can assist them to identify which areas of resource efficiency to prioritise. Tom Ellis, Principal Environmental Planning Officer says: We are inviting businesses in the East of England to attend this free event. By attending this conference, they could increase the productivity and competitiveness of their business. Antony Gough, Director of Renewables East says: Increasing resource costs and concerns around material scarcity have created additional challenges to business growth and long term sustainability.

/government/news/environment-agency-helps-create-new-dorset-woodlands,"The Environment Agency has teamed up with the Woodland Trust and local landowners to create two new areas of woodland near Dorchester. Environment Agency helps create new Dorset woodlands  Environment Agency More than 3,400 trees have been planted on the Frome and Piddle catchment in a partnership project. Woodlands are not only an important part of the British landscape – they also improve water quality in our streams and rivers and can reduce flood risk. The woodlands, each covering approximately 1 hectare, were recently planted at two priority sites - the Came Estate and Lower Burton Mill, where the most environmental benefit can be achieved. Species planted include alder, willow, oak, field maple, wild cherry, hazel, hawthorn and dog rose. The project, which cost just over £9,000, included the cost of the trees and fencing plus two training events when advisors from various organisations including FWAG and the Dorset Wildlife Trust received instruction in the importance of trees in river valleys. There are plans to extend the project to the Hampshire Avon where the establishment of additional areas of woodland are expected to bring further benefits. Kim Goonesekera from the Environment Agency said: We are very pleased to have worked with the Woodland Trust and local landowners on this exciting project and look forward to seeing these two areas of woodland grow and play a vital role improving and supporting the surrounding river system and countryside. Hamish Thomson from the Woodland Trust said: Trees help our natural landscape in so many ways. I have seen first hand how landowners in the South West have benefited from them. The trees planted in partnership with the Environment Agency will hopefully demonstrate how in the long term trees can help reduce flood risk and improve water quality. Photos of the newly planted woodlands are available from the Environment Agency press office on 01392 352233. ENDS Notes to Editor: How trees help the environment: Protecting water quality: Trees and woods can buffer watercourses from run-off from adjacent land, acting as nutrient soaks and reducing the amount of pollutants and sediment reaching the water. Reducing erosion: Tree roots bind soil and stabilise banks, reducing soil erosion and sedimentation. Sustaining wildlife: The dappled shade cast on the river by trees planted on the riverbank moderates water temperature and helps maintain a suitable environment for aquatic wildlife and improves rivers for fishing. Mitigating flooding: Tree improve infiltration and reduce surface run-off. By planting on floodplains, the release of flood water is delayed."

/government/news/sutton-harbour-swing-bridge-to-close-for-essential-repairs,"The pedestrian swing bridge over the lock gates at Sutton Harbour in Plymouth is to be closed from Tuesday 20th May for six weeks to allow for the replacement of an essential bearing. Sutton Harbour swing bridge to close for essential repairs  Environment Agency The bridge operates independently of the harbour’s lock gates so access for vessels will be unaffected. An alternative pedestrian route is available around the perimeter of the harbour and will be clearly signposted. The decision to close the bridge follows engineering investigatory works by the Environment Agency, which has joint maintenance responsibility for the bridge with harbour owner and operator Sutton Harbour Holdings Plc. The issue relates to the bridge’s slew bearing, which is the main component on which the bridge pivots. This has recently been discovered to be worn and without replacement will result in the bridge becoming jammed, potentially blocking the harbour entrance. The Environment Agency has therefore advised that the bridge be closed at the end of a three week notice period which starts today (29th April). The repair is expected to take six weeks from the end of the notice period, which means the bridge would re-open at the beginning of July. Dave Turner from the Environment Agency said: We don’t want to take the risk of the bridge jamming resulting in a much larger repair and impeding harbour traffic, which would mean it having to close for longer. Giving users notice now before the school holidays is the best course of action. Pete Bromley, Harbour Master of Sutton Harbour, said: This is an essential repair to ensure safe passage of pedestrians in the short term. Longer term it is highly likely that the bridge will need to be replaced in its entirety. There will inevitably be some inconvenience for users but recent investment by Sutton Harbour Holdings in the harbour’s Heritage Trail means there is an alternative route and this will be clearly signposted. The replacement slew bearing, which is contained within a sealed unit, is having to be specifically manufactured. This means the faulty bearing must be removed first and transported to a specialist firm in Wiltshire before work on the new bespoke bearing can begin. The swing bridge will be temporarily closed this Thursday 1st May from 8.30am until 12.30pm to allow for some routine maintenance and further engineering investigations, but is then expected to operate as normal until the six-week closure from 20th May."

In summary, these interventions will: • Reduce existing and future flood risk to the Lower Bristol Road and 60 properties on the South side of the river through the provision of new flood defences; • Provide the flood mitigation to enable the redevelopment of the Bath Quays and Manvers Street sites forming the first step towards the realisation of the Bath City Riverside Enterprise Area and the Council’s ‘Innovation Quays’ project. While the project was started as a flood mitigation and defence project, it is also a major opportunity to significantly enhance the riverside – creating better access and a more beautiful and enjoyable environment for local people and visitors to the city. The Bath Quays Waterside Project will support the delivery of around 2,500 new homes, 650,000 square feet of new workspace and 9,000 new jobs for local people as part of the Bath City Riverside Enterprise Area. It will overcome one of the major stumbling blocks to unlocking the potential of brownfield sites along the River Avon – the possibility of flooding. The Council and Environment Agency are funding these essential works with a combination of Flood Defence Grant and Revolving Infrastructure funding made available by West of England Local Enterprise Partnership. Ed Lockington, from the Environment Agency, said: We welcome working in partnership on this important piece of work and are pleased to work with Bath & North East Somerset Council on this project, which will reduce existing flood risk in Bath and help provide exciting redevelopment opportunities. What are the specific plans? • Significantly widening the north bank at the lower tow-path level (up to 15m wide) between Churchill Bridge and Green Park to move water through this area more quickly in flood conditions; This will require that Green Park Road is diverted away from the riverside northwards to link up with Corn Street creating the major opportunity to open up the riverside to the city. This part of the plan offers the potential to transform the riverside creating upper and lower level river promenades, a defined cycle route, cafes, public art and ecology, a riverside public space offering opportunities for outdoor performances and events, greater opportunities to hold more activities on the river eg boat races. This environment would provide an attractive and playful waterfront for Bath that can be used and enjoyed all year round by local people; There are currently no plans to alter Green Park itself, other than some landscape improvements at the river’s edge; • Trees along the southern verge of Green Park Road and along the new road alignment will be removed and replaced with new planting. • Raising river walls on the south side of the river between Churchill Bridge and Midland Bridge; • Improving flood defences on existing buildings fronting onto the river along Lower Bristol Road; • Improving surface water sewer and pumping station for Lower Bristol Road; • Timescale for start is 2015. Safeguarding wildlife and trees The Council’s responsibility to safeguard wildlife and trees that could be affected by the plans is being taken seriously. A full series of surveys have been undertaken in respect of wildlife and ecology, including surveys of trees and bird species using the trees, as well as bat and reptile surveys. Expert opinion has also been sought from the Environment Agency, Natural England and the private sector. The scheme represents an opportunity to enhance the river corridor for ecology and will consider the creation of new habitats. The removal of parts of the existing Green Park Road is likely to will require the removal of mature trees along the edge of the upper bank at North Quays – this is not something the Council takes lightly. These are mainly Poplar trees from the 1970s that were planted to screen Green Park Road from the opposite side of the river and are reaching the end of their natural life. The new scheme will reinstate mature trees and landscaping which will ultimately offer higher ecological and amenity value. Ends"
/government/news/environment-agency-revokes-northamptonshire-permit,"An appeal by Think Environmental Ltd against its permit being revoked by the Environment Agency for a site in Northamptonshire has been dismissed. Environment Agency revokes Northamptonshire permit  Environment Agency The company ran a bio-drying and waste management centre at Blackbridge Farm, Cranford Road, Burton Latimer which had 2 fires. In October 2012 Think Environmental was fined a total of £33,000 and full costs of £15,000 for failing to stop smells from the site and failing to remove illegally buried waste on paddock land next to its permitted site. The fires caused smoke concerns to residents and led to the closure of the A6 on 1 occasion as well as a fish kill on the Alledge Brook. Its permit was revoked on 23 May 2013 with steps to remove the remaining waste on site. An appeal against the revocation was heard by The Planning Inspectorate (Dec 13). In upholding the revocation, the inspector Isobel McCretton stated: Given the sustained non-compliance and offending at the site and failure to comply with a raft of enforcement measures, I consider that the Environmental Permit should be revoked. The revocation notice was issued after a sustained period of non-compliance with the permit. Advice, warnings, other enforcement action, voluntary agreements and Post Conviction Plans all failed to secure removal of the excess waste from the site and the paddock and compliance with the permit conditions. She said: There was a repeat pattern of offending with serious impact on health and the environment. There were ongoing environmental problems at the site and the Environment Agency considered that the appellant was likely to re-offend. The appeal was made under the Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2010."

/government/news/sea-trout-return-to-the-river-leven-after-a-century-of-absence,"First rod catch of sea trout for a century. Sea trout return to the River Leven after a century of absence  Environment Agency A sea trout has been caught by an angler on the River Leven in Teesside – marking a huge milestone in efforts to bring migratory fish back to the area. In what is believed to be the first rod catch of sea trout on the Leven since the Industrial Revolution, the angler who landed the fish reported the exciting catch to the Environment Agency. The Leven is a tributary of the River Tees, where salmon and sea trout catch data show that migratory fish are returning to the catchment following decades of absence. Water quality in the River Tees, following the Industrial Revolution, used to be so bad that fish could not live in it. But the Environment Agency and its partners have worked hard to improve water quality and ensure that fish can move upstream. This involved the construction of a fish pass on the lower River Leven in 2007, allowing fish to reach spawning grounds upstream. The catch on the Leven comes after a fisheries survey in 2010 recorded a salmon in the river. Paul Frear, Fisheries Technical Officer at the Environment Agency, said: I’m really excited about this catch. There have been rumours among anglers that sea trout are back in the Leven, but now we have cast-iron proof. We constructed a fish pass on the lower River Leven in 2007 that would allow fish from the River Tees to return to spawning grounds on the upper Leven, which had previously been cut-off for over a century. Salmon and sea trout are in important part of our rivers’ ecology and they are a valuable economic fish stock – so this is fantastic news for the North East. One local angler said: I am delighted to see that these little ‘bars of silver’ can now ascend the River Leven once again after an absence of scores of years. It’s wonderful. Rod catch data show a significant rise in salmon and sea trout on the Tees since the early 1990s. It is predicted that the Tees rod catch will meet its catch target of 485 rod caught fish by about early to mid 2020s if it follows the same pattern of recovery as the Tyne and Wear."

/government/news/another-successful-lincshore-campaign-draws-to-a-close,"A major scheme to reduce flood risk to thousands of homes and businesses on the Lincolnshire coast has been completed ahead of schedule. Another successful Lincshore campaign draws to a close  Environment Agency Lincshore – the Environment Agency’s multi-million pound flagship scheme – finished on Friday 23 May. This year’s campaign began on 17 April following on from work to rebuild the sand dunes north of Mablethorpe that were badly damaged by the December tidal surge. Mark Adams, Coastal Engineer, said: Once again, we have been using the dredger Breughel, one of the biggest the project team has ever used. Breughel’s large capacity has meant we have been able to complete the scheme quickly well ahead of the summer tourist season. During Lincshore we build up beach levels to replace sand lost to the sea over winter. It is vital to reduce flood risk on the coast and also benefits tourism by maintaining the beaches – without it there would be little sand. As always, we would like to thank people living and working along the coast for their patience during this year’s scheme. Without Lincshore, tens of thousands of homes would be at severe risk of flooding, along with commercial and industrial properties. A number of important environmental sites would also be affected. The scheme works by increasing the level of the beach to reduce the risk of waves reaching and over-topping the main defences. It protects the clay foreshore against further erosion and prevents rapid deterioration of the defences. This year’s 5 week campaign has seen around 520,000m³ cubic metres of sand pumped from licensed off-shore sites onto beaches along a 20km stretch of the Lincolnshire coastline. Beaches that have been nourished include Boygrift, Trusthorpe and Mablethorpe, Sutton on Sea, Chapel Six Marshes, Ingoldmells, Trunch Lane, Huttoft and Moggs Eye. Lincshore first began in 1994 and covers beaches from Mablethorpe to Skegness. The scheme maintains protection against a 1 in 200 chance in any 1 year of tidal flood (0.5%) for 30,000 properties and 35,000 hectares of land. Lincshore offers the coast an excellent standard of protection but people living and working in coastal communities should take steps to ensure they know what to do in an emergency.

/government/news/groundwater-flooding-exhibition-to-be-staged-in-south-west,"A joint exhibition aimed at people and communities who have been affected by groundwater flooding is being staged by the Environment Agency together with Dorset, Wiltshire and Hampshire Councils.      Groundwater flooding exhibition to be staged in South West  Environment Agency The Agency and the various councils have joined forces to host the event on Saturday, 7 June between 10am and 4pm at the City Hall, Malthouse Lane, Salisbury, Wiltshire. The exhibition is part of a series of drop-in events that the various organisation have been hosting over the last couple of months. More than 100 people attended a previous event in Salisbury. Feedback from the earlier events suggest people would like more information about the practical ways in which they can protect their homes and to assist people who are applying for the Government funded ‘Repair and Resilience Grant’. Staff from the Environment Agency and local councils will be attending and giving more information about these grants. There will be more than a dozen suppliers and consultants in attendance offering a broad spectrum of services from advice on engineering through to supply of flood protection equipment including pumps and barriers. Guy Parker for the Environment Agency said: We are working closely with the local authorities and other partners to ensure people are fully aware of the flooding risk from groundwater and can get advice to reduce that risk. Groundwater flooding does represent a significant hazard and groundwater conditions can also exacerbate surface flooding,’ A major risk from groundwater flooding is that it does not always appear where it might be expected, rising up through cellars and floors rather than coming in through doors. It can also cause a problem with drains and sewers where they are overwhelmed. Cllr Peter Finney, Dorset County Council Cabinet member for environment and economy, said: It is important that people who have been affected by flooding have access to support and advice to help prevent or reduce flooding in the future. We are working partnership with The Environment Agency and local communities to find practical ways for residents to protect their properties. I encourage anyone who thinks that groundwater flooding could be an issue to go along and find out more.

/government/news/public-exhibitions-on-dawlish-and-exmouth-beach-management,"The Environment Agency, Teignbridge District Council and East Devon District Council are working on a beach management project that will look at two key locations on both sides of the estuary, Exmouth and Dawlish Warren.  Public exhibitions on Dawlish and Exmouth beach management  Environment Agency These organisations are working together to stage two public drop-in exhibitions in June to provide some more information on the project and give local people an opportunity to comment on the proposals. These are projects following on from the Exe Estuary Flood & Coastal Erosion Risk Management Strategy which identified how to manage the flood and coastal erosion risk in the estuary now and into the future. The first drop-in exhibition will be held on 24 June between 2pm and 8pm at the Ocean Blue Bowling Complex, The Esplanade, Exmouth, and the second on 25 June again between 2pm and 8pm at Langstone Cliff Hotel, Mount Pleasant Road, Dawlish Warren. Representatives from each organisation will be there to answer questions and to receive feedback on what people think about the proposed works. A range of information will be available about the project including how the beaches at Dawlish Warren and Exmouth work and the natural processes that shape the coastline, and how the winter storms affected the beachfront defences. The exhibitions will show the recent damage caused and the repair works undertaken. People attending the exhibition will also be able to view proposals for the new flood defence planned near the Visitor Centre at Dawlish Warren. There will also be information on how some of the groynes on the beaches at Dawlish Warren and Exmouth could be repaired or replaced and how the beaches could be recharged by adding extra sand. There will also be information explaining plans to remove a section of gabions at Dawlish Warren. A collection of historic paintings gathered on behalf of the Living with a Changing Coast (LiCCo) project and showing the Exe Estuary of yesteryear will also be on display at both exhibitions. At Exmouth there will also be a free talk starting at 7pm by the Exmouth Historical and Archaeological Society to explain their research and the changing coastline as shown by these artworks. Martin Davies from the Environment Agency said: We would like to know what people think about the scheme. Also, if people have any information about the local environment or the activities that could be affected by the proposals we would like to hear from them.’ Teignbridge District Council and East Devon District Council will have some leaflets and display information at the exhibitions about other projects happening along the seafront. Cllr Kevin Lake, Teignbridge District Council’s Executive Spokesman for Environmental Services which includes coastal services, said: With its blue flag award winning beach and world acclaimed National Nature Reserve, Dawlish Warren is important to our tourism industry, Teignbridge’s ecology, wildlife and coastal defence. As the great storm of February showed, it’s also continuingly at risk from taking a battering from the elements. The exhibitions are a great opportunity for people to come and see the repair works so far and what is planned for the future. The Exe Estuary Strategy and recent storms have shown that parts of Dawlish Warren in particular are at risk of being damaged or breached and this risk will increase as sea level rise and storms become more frequent. If this happened, it would increase the risk of flooding to the railway line and estuary communities such as Starcross, Lympstone and Exmouth. The works needed at Dawlish Warren are required to allow the sand spit to continue to act as a barrier to storm waves but also to improve the amenity value of the beach and to allow the sand dunes to function naturally. Although less urgent, the works that are needed for Exmouth seafront will also be explained. The Dawlish Warren and Exmouth Beach Management Scheme will review and deliver the works required to manage the beaches at these estuary locations Ends"
/government/news/water-company-fined-for-sewage-treatment-works-pollution,"South West Water has been ordered to pay £153,600 in fines and costs for three offences at a sewage treatment works in Cornwall. Water company fined for sewage treatment works pollution  Environment Agency Truro Crown Court heard how between July 9 – 23, 2013 the company’s sewage treatment works at Luxulyan near St Austell was not operating properly. This resulted in poorly treated sewage effluent discharging into the Par River. The case was brought by the Environment Agency. South West Water is required, under its site permit, to ensure the treatment works operates correctly and notify the Environment Agency of any problems that might affect effluent quality. Treated effluent must be of a standard that does not cause pollution. An Environment Agency officer visited the treatment works on July 18 and immediately realised there was a ‘serious problem’ at the plant. A final effluent sample had a biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) of 66.4mg/litre. This exceeded the site’s maximum permitted limit of 56 mg/litre. Under normal conditions final effluent should not have a BOD above 20mg/litre. Further checks revealed that one of five surface aerators had been taken out of service in March 2013 and not yet been repaired or replaced. The treatment system can cope without one surface aerator, but when a second aerator failed in July, the works could no longer function properly. Phil Christie for the Environment Agency said: The site wasn’t being managed and maintained properly. South West Water took an unreasonably long time to repair a broken aerator (March to September) and this meant the works were running at a significantly reduced efficiency. The company didn’t spot problems quickly enough or respond with the speed and urgency required. It is estimated that during the incident, nearly one tonne of poorly treated sewage effluent was discharged into the Par River every minute. The discharge had an impact on river ecology for a quarter of a mile downstream of Luxulyan with a thick growth of sewage fungus over 175 metres the riverbed. The court heard the system used to kill viruses and bacteria at the treatment plant (UV disinfection) was significantly undermined by the poor quality sewage effluent. The River Par enters the sea at Par beach some 7 km downstream of Luxulyan. Cornwall Council posted warning signs on local beaches after the Environment Agency declared an ‘abnormal situation.’ At a sentencing hearing at Truro Crown Court, Judge Harvey Clark fined South West Water a total of £150,000 for three offences under the Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2010 including failing to return Luxulyan sewage treatment works to normal operation as soon as practicable, exceeding the Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) discharge limit of 56mg/l and failing to inform the Environment Agency of any failure that may adversely affect effluent quality. The company was also ordered to pay £3,600 costs. In his summing up, Judge Clark said, after studying the evidence, he was satisfied South West Water was guilty of negligence. Staff at Luxulyan sewage treatment works, he said, had ‘lacked proper vigilance’ and the company had failed to put in place adequate personnel or proper systems at the site to ensure offences did not occur. Fines for environmental offences committed by utilities and other large companies are likely to be significantly higher following recent judgements in the Court of Appeal and new Sentencing Guidelines.

/government/news/somerset-farmer-fined-for-polluting-stream-with-slurry,"A Somerset dairy farmer has been ordered to pay £14,900 in fines and costs for polluting a stream with slurry.  Somerset farmer fined for polluting stream with slurry  Environment Agency In February 2013 the Environment Agency investigated a report that a stream in the village of Hardington Mandeville had turned green/brown and smelled strongly of slurry. The pollution was traced to Manor Farm where a slurry lagoon and dirty water system had overflowed allowing slurry to enter watercourses running through the farmyard. A court heard there was a history of pollution incidents at Manor Farm. The Environment Agency had, over a number of years, recommended improvements at the farm to reduce the risk of pollution from slurry and dirty water. This advice had been ignored. In this latest incident, the pollution entered the Chinook Brook and was visible some six kilometres downstream at the confluence with the River Parrett. Appearing before Yeovil magistrates, William Turner, of Manor Farm, Hardington Mandeville, Yeovil was fined £10,000 and ordered to pay £4,900 costs after pleading guilty to discharging poisonous, noxious or polluting matter into a tributary of the Chinook Brook, an offence under the Environmental Permitting Regulations 2010. The Environment Agency has issued anti-pollution works notices that require specific works to be carried out at Manor Farm including an alarm system in the dirty water tanks to warn when they are full. Mr Turner has now agreed to ensure that clean and dirty water on the farm are separated. Dan Aplin for the Environment Agency said: Farm slurry is highly polluting if it escapes into rivers and streams. Farmers must ensure their dirty water systems operate correctly and are properly maintained. The problems at this farm were largely due to a failure, on the part of the defendant, to make badly-needed improvements to his slurry handling system. ENDS"
/government/news/devon-farmer-prosecuted-for-food-and-septic-tank-waste-offences,"A Devon farmer has been given a suspended prison sentence and ordered to pay £1,000 costs for a series of waste offences. Devon farmer prosecuted for food and septic tank waste offences  Environment Agency The offences involved liquid food and abattoir waste and Andrew Bull was also ordered to carry out 100 hours community service. Liquid food waste contains nutrients and is used as an agricultural fertiliser and soil improver. It can only be spread on land when it is needed and not disposed of in a way that could cause pollution. The storage and spreading of this type of waste is controlled by the Environment Agency through a series of environmental permits. A court heard how in August 2010 Andrew Bull was granted a permit to store liquid waste in lagoons at three farms in the Beaworthy area of West Devon. He also stored septic tank waste at one of the farms. This wasn’t covered by a permit and is what is known as an ‘exempt’ activity. In 2013 Environment Agency officers carried out a number of inspections and on each occasion offences were discovered at different lagoons. At Little Pullworthy the lagoon was almost full with little, if any freeboard. The permit states waste must not be stored within 0.75m of the top of the lagoon. This is to reduce the risk of over-topping during wet weather. The husbandry of the site was poor. Officers noticed an orange liquid leaching from a manure pile and there was evidence that waste had escaped from one of the septic tank lagoons. The waste from the lagoon contained sewage debris and was unsuitable for spreading on land. Septic tank waste must be stored without harming the environment. Liquid waste was still present in a lagoon at Great Rutleigh Ball more than two months after permission for its storage had expired. Not only had the lagoon not been emptied, it had also been over-filled to within 150mm of the top. These offences were breaches of the permit. During one visit to Little Pullworthy Farm, Agency officers saw a ‘black liquid oozing out of the ground’. It had leaked from a septic tank lagoon. Magistrates heard there had been a history of similar offences at sites operated by the defendant. Tim de Winton for the Environment Agency said: Liquid wastes can be beneficial when used as a fertiliser, but they must be stored safely to protect human health and the environment. It is important storage lagoons are regularly checked and properly maintained. Farmers must ensure they comply with the conditions of their permits. If they don’t, they risk prosecution. Appearing before Exeter magistrates, Andrew Bull, of Little Pullworthy Farm, Highampton, Beaworthy was given an 18 week prison sentence suspended for two years, ordered to carry out 100 hours community service and pay £1000 costs after pleading guilty to a total of five offences under the Environmental Permitting Regulations 2010.

/government/news/winners-of-the-2014-uk-water-efficiency-awards-announced,"The Environment Agency and Waterwise recognises businesses and organisations going the extra mile to save water.  Winners of the 2014 UK Water Efficiency Awards announced  Environment Agency The UK Water Efficiency Award winners range from large scale behaviour change campaigns to individual SME initiatives which have reduced water use by up to 80 per cent. They demonstrate how organisations which save water can help to provide the conditions for both economic growth and healthier communities, at the same time as cutting costs, protecting the environment and reducing carbon emissions. Trevor Bishop, Deputy Director of Water Resources at the Environment Agency, said: There are enormous savings – both financial and environmental – to be made by saving water. Those businesses implementing water efficiency measures will be better prepared for future pressures such as climate and population change. They are also helping to maintain our well-being and prosperity. I would like to congratulate all those who took part. We hope that these examples provide inspiration to others, encouraging them to protect water by investing in water management improvements. Jacob Tompkins, Waterwise’s Managing Director, said: Despite heavy rain over recent months, these award entries show that companies are taking a long term view and constantly improving their water management. This means that they will be better prepared for droughts and floods. Innovation and education need to be at the heart of efforts to reduce water use. At Waterwise we’re always happy to work with organisations to unlock this potential. We’re even happier when they seize on these opportunities themselves. The categories and winners are: Farming and Horticulture Broughgammon Farm , winner of the award for farming and horticulture, has embraced water saving at all levels of its business. Washing machines, outside taps and toilets are all supplied by rainwater harvesting tanks. Staff are encouraged to save water wherever possible and the farm showcases best practice of water management to others in the farming community. As a result of its efforts Broughgammon Farm has increased its resilience to extreme weather and water shortages in the future. Runner-up in the farming and horticulture sector is Source of Business (part of South West Water). The project developed PAPA Pumps which transfer water from natural water courses to farms and other water users. Powered by natural flowing water, they provide continuous carbon neutral pumping, with no operating costs. The system saves South West Water £257 per mega litre in treatment costs and 40kg of carbon. The system is also helping to improve water quality by keeping livestock away from watercourses. Built Environment Winner of the built environment award was H2Eco , a large-scale retrofit project by Essex & Suffolk Water. In partnership with housing associations, the project provides plumbers free of charge to fit water saving products in participants’ homes and properties. To date it has delivered 14,999 water efficiency retrofit audits resulting in water savings of 22 litres on average per property per day. In total the project saves customers £250,480 a year. Having previously won this award in 2012, the judges felt that the H2Eco project was deserving of the 2014 award for its continued impact and legacy for customers. Runner-up in the build environment category was EcoFIT, a project by Northumbrian Water which has delivered 4,555 retrofit water audits, saving 183,931 litres per day, equating to an average measured saving of 40.38 litres per day for each participating property. As a result, Northumbrian Water customers saved an average of £40.57 a year on their water and sewerage bill. Research and Evaluation The Energy Savings Trust won the research and evaluation award with its ‘At Home With Water’ project. The team developed a Water Energy Calculator , helping households to learn about their water use and potential savings. The tool collected data from more than 86,000 homes across the UK. The results were widely reported in the media, reaching an estimated 76% of the UK population with water efficiency messages. H2Eco Research by Essex & Suffolk Water was runner-up in the research and evaluation category. The E2Eco project analysed 1.5 million results, helping to improve the industry’s evidence base. Campaigns and Education The European Water Label by the Bathroom Manufacturers Association (BMA) won the campaigns and education award. The scheme provides recognisable labelling and an online database showing the water-use characteristics of bathroom and kitchen products. Since launching in 2006, the voluntary label scheme has seen significant growth. Around 6,000 products are currently listed on the database and the scheme is supported by bathroom retailers, merchants and manufacturers across Europe. The Little Green Riding Hood play by Northumbria Water was runner-up for its creative approach to education. It focused on educating primary school children about their ‘good’ and ‘bad’ water use habits. Landscape and Gardening A project by Northumbria Water, Middlesbrough Council and Middlesbrough Environment City to improve water use at Saltersgill allotments won the landscape and gardening award. The project aimed to educate allotment plot holders about the impact of their water use on the local community. As a result, water consumption reduced at the Saltersgill site by over 20,000 litres. The runner-up was Essex & Suffolk Water with their ‘Save a bucket load’ campaign which promoted efficient use of water in the garden during April and May 2013. Business and Industry Seacourt , a small printing company in Oxford won the business and industry award for its commitment to dramatically reduce its water consumption. The SME has cut its water use by 80% over the past 13 years. The savings were achieved via new machinery and a companywide drive to save water. Aquafund by Ealing Council was runner-up for cutting the Council’s water use by 33%. Innovation The award for innovation went to Anglian Water for its water in-house display . The system provides information on water use, leak alarms and water budgeting tools which can be enjoyed by the whole family. 11,300 customers have installed the devises, saving 9 litres of water per property per day and cutting overall water demand by 4%. The system has been widely disseminated across the UK and Europe and there is potential for this technology to be adapted for email, smart phone applications and social media. Runner-up of the innovation award was the sustainable communities partnership project by Save Water Save Money . The initiative was designed for social housing tenanted properties and installed CombiSmart devices free of charge. The project reports to have saved 400,000 litres of water per day. The Chairman’s Award The Environment Agency Chairman’s Award, chosen by Lord Chris Smith from entries by water companies, went to the domestic metering water efficiency campaign by Southern Water . Part of a metering programme for 500,000 homes, this project sought to educate homeowners on water saving methods, providing financial assistance to those on low incomes. As a result over 166,000 water-saving products were installed alongside water meters. Household water consumption was reduced by up to 112 litres per property, saving customers an estimated £1.8 million on water bills. The project scored highly across all of the judging criteria and was seen as a great example of combining face-to-face advice, interventions and financial assistance to customers to ensure water efficiency. Exemplar Awards There was also recognition for those leading the way in water efficiency within their part of the UK. The winners for Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales were: Northern Ireland: Water management throughout the CAFRE Estate by the College of Agriculture, Food and Rural Enterprise .

/government/news/waste-dealer-jailed-for-16-months-after-dangerous-shipments-stopped-at-port,"Essex man jailed after Environment Agency investigation into illegal waste exports Waste dealer jailed for 16 months after dangerous shipments stopped at port  Environment Agency Repeat waste crime offender Joe Benson was today sentenced to 16 months in prison at Snaresbrook Crown Court for illegally exporting 46 tonnes of hazardous electrical waste to Nigeria, Ghana, the Ivory Coast and the Congo. Broken cathode ray tube televisions and ozone depleting fridge freezers were found in four containers intercepted at ports by Environment Agency investigators between September 2012 and April 2013. This is the first time a defendant has been sentenced to a custodial sentence for illegally exporting waste. Mr Benson was previously convicted of exporting similar hazardous electrical waste to Nigeria in 2011 during one of the Environment Agency’s biggest export cases, Operation Boron. However he continued to illegally export televisions and freezers to West Africa while appealing, unsuccessfully, against his previous convictions. It is thought that Benson, 54, of Broad Street, Loughton, Essex, stood to make around £32,000 from the export of the intercepted containers. He collected the electrical waste from civic amenity sites in London and the Home Counties and took it to his licensed waste site in Walthamstow where it should have been tested for functionality and safety before being exported. He made money by collecting the waste and selling it on at about £8,000 a container as well as avoiding the costs incurred in dealing with the waste safely. Andrew Higham, who leads the Environment Agency’s National Environmental Crime Team, said: These are not victimless crimes. The rules governing the exportation of waste electrical equipment are in place for good reason, to protect human life and the environment. It is illegal to send hazardous waste to these countries. Mr Benson has seen fit to flaunt the rules for his own personal benefit. The Environment Agency has a specialist crime unit to track and prosecute criminals who export waste illegally. Director of regulated industry Harvey Bradshaw said: This sentence is a landmark ruling because it’s the first time anyone has been sent to prison for illegal waste exports as a result of our investigations. We take a zero tolerance approach to those commit waste crime, and cracking down on illegal waste exports will continue to be a priority for the Environment Agency. We urge anyone in the waste industry to help us protect their legitimate business and report any suspicious activity to Crimestoppers anonymously. Working electronics can be exported for resale and there is a legitimate market for used goods. But the law is clear – it is always illegal to send hazardous electronic waste from the UK to developing countries where it could be dumped and burnt to extract precious metals, posing serious risks to people’s health and damage to the environment. They can contain hazardous materials such as lead, phosphors and ozone depleting substances. Environment Agency prosecutors showed that Mr Benson’s containers gave the impression that relevant guidelines were being met. Independent testing showed this was not the case and that the exports were illegal. Mr Benson entered a guilty plea at an earlier hearing. While sentencing Judge Dawson said: In my view this is a serious offence that you have committed before. The public and the world need protecting from this sort of offence."

/government/news/find-out-more-about-the-stockton-on-tees-flood-defence-scheme,"Public drop-in to be held on Wednesday 2 July Find out more about the Stockton-on-Tees flood defence scheme  Environment Agency Plans to protect properties in the Lustrum Beck area of Stockton from flooding are being revealed on 2 July. A drop-in is being held by the Environment Agency and Stockton Borough Council to give residents further information on the proposed works. The project, managed by the Environment Agency working in partnership with Stockton Borough Council, will protect 162 homes in Browns Bridge and Oxbridge from high water levels in Lustrum Beck. Both organisations have been working closely together over the last year to find a solution to the flood risk problem along Lustrum Beck. The £3 million project will be funded by a mixture of government and local levy funding and a contribution from Stockton Borough Council. The project will be delivered by the Environment Agency, with Stockton Borough Council leading on the works to Londonderry Bridge on Durham Road, which is a key element of the scheme. A public drop-in meeting will take place on Wednesday 2 July between 3pm and 6.30pm at the Grey’s Road Institute, Grey’s Road, Stockton, allowing residents to find out more about the works. Flood risk experts from the Environment Agency and the Council will be on hand to discuss the plans. Samantha Boyes, project manager of the scheme from the Environment Agency, said: Flood risk in this area is really complex, and it has been a real challenge to find a solution. We are pleased to have found a solution that is affordable and offers a higher level of protection than previously proposed schemes. Working closely with the Council and taking a new approach to flood risk in the catchment has allowed this to be possible and we are looking forward to discussing the proposals with residents. Stockton Council’s Cabinet Member for the Environment, Councillor David Rose said: I hope everyone living in the Lustrum Beck area takes the opportunity to visit the drop-in to find out more about the works which will help to protect their properties from flooding in future. We do not want to see a repeat of the devastation caused by the Autumn 2012 floods and that is why we have worked with the Environment Agency to do all we can to secure funding to enable progression of these flood defence works. I am delighted that we have now reached a point where we can share the plans with residents and explain the timeline for delivery of the works. The scheme will involve replacing and raising flood walls and embankments in the Newtown area, improvements at Durham Road bridge and a new screen on Primrose Hill culvert. A second phase of works is also planned which will involve number of flood storage areas in the upper catchment."
/government/news/native-crayfish-relocated-ahead-of-weir-repairs,"Protected native crayfish to be relocated ahead of essential weir repairs in Scarborough  Native crayfish relocated ahead of weir repairs  Environment Agency The Environment Agency is relocating native crayfish from the Sea Cut watercourse in Scarborough ahead of some repairs to the Lower Newby Weir. A jet of water was seen shooting up from the face of the Lower Newby Weir in spring 2012 and an inspection revealed the need for repairs. The Sea Cut was first built in the Napoleonic era following a major flood event in 1799. Over the years additional weirs have been constructed to prevent erosion of the river bed and banks. Some structures have deteriorated and a crack has now appeared on the Lower Newby Weir’s face, allowing water to flow through the weir rather than over it. The water pool above the weir, between the Lower Newby Weir and the Cascade Weir, will be drained so that the underwater structures can be checked. Whilst the pool is drained, the old concrete sloping face on the right side of the weir will be replaced, repairs will be carried out to the side walls, the joints on the sloping face will be replaced with water-tight joints to prevent seepage and large blocks of masonry will be removed from the bottom of the pool that cause accumulation of gravel and stone in the centre of the pool. The pool is a habitat to several different species of fish, such as trout, and eels. There are also thought to be around 100 endangered White Clawed Crayfish living there. The turbidity of the water will be tested because White Clawed Crayfish are better suited in clean, shallow water. The White Clawed Crayfish are Britain’s only native freshwater crayfish. They are significantly threatened by the invasion of the non-native Signal Crayfish. The White Clawed Crayfish are protected under Schedule 5 of the Wildlife & Countryside Act of 1981 so they are going to be safely relocated a short distance downstream during the repairs. Ian Cooke, the project leader, said: I am pleased to see work starting because the weir is an important structure which helps to keep the surrounding area including the Newby Bridge stable. Rain stopped work last year when we tried to undertake the repair so I am hoping for dry weather for the next few weeks. The repairs are due to take place in early July until late August. Once the weir is fully repaired, there are plans to build a picnic area overlooking the river."
/government/news/work-to-start-on-exeter-flood-defence-scheme,"The first phase of Exeter’s £30 million flood defence scheme will begin next month with improvements to the main flood relief channel. Work to start on Exeter flood defence scheme  Environment Agency When finished the new scheme will reduce flood risk to approximately 3,000 homes and businesses throughout the city. The Environment Agency and its partners, Devon County Council and Exeter City Council, will also be holding a series of public exhibitions to seek people’s views about the designs for phase two of the scheme between 11 July and 19 July at various locations around Exeter. The contract for phase 1 of the work has been awarded to Team Van Oord who will initially set up a site compound and storage area in the Riverside Valley Park and on Bromham’s Farm playing field. Phase 1 will include deepening the existing flood relief channel, lowering the spill weir at the top of Trew’s flood relief channel and removing a ‘check weir’ at the bottom of the channel. These works will increase the flow capacity of the main flood channel. Large dumper trucks will be used to remove excavated material from the flood relief channel. The material will be temporarily stored on Bromham’s Farm playing field then re-used during phase two of the project. This will help reduce construction traffic bringing in new material. Other improvements include the construction of a meandering stream through the centre of the flood relief channel, construction of fish passes on Trew’s weir plus a low level pedestrian access across the middle of the flood relief channel. George Arnison for the Environment Agency said: The works will cause some disruption, but we hope people will understand why we need to carry out the work in order to reduce flood risk to people and properties in Exeter. Steps taken to minimise disruption include: continued public access to the ‘island’ between the River Exe and the Trew’s flood relief channel during construction allotment users will still be able to access their plots the footpath and cycle path alongside Trew’s flood relief channel will remain open. However, there will be some unavoidable delays due to lorry movements across the path. Before this work begins, signs will be erected directing people to alternative routes alongside Exeter Canal. Work on phase 2 is planned to start in Autumn 2015. Designs for the second phase are still being finalised. The Environment Agency and its partners are planning exhibitions in July to share the latest plans with people and seek their views on the proposals. The designs will go on show at Exeter Guildhall on July 11 from 10.00 to 6.00pm and at the Royal Albert Memorial Museum on July 12 between 10.30 and 4.30pm and at the X Centre, The Quay, on July 19 between 10.30 and 4.30pm. In addition there will be smaller meetings for residents in areas most affected by the proposed work. Cllr Andrew Leadbetter, Devon County Council Cabinet member for Economy and Growth said: Public consultation played an important part in informing the initial stage of this project which is vital to our city’s homes and businesses. We are hoping for an equally positive response to these further consultation events. You can stay up to date with the latest plans for the scheme by visiting GOV.UK and searching for Exeter flood. If you are unable to attend any of these events, but would like to share your views with the project team, you can email Exeter Flood Defence Scheme or write to Exeter flood defence scheme, Manley House, Kestrel Way, Exeter, EX2 7LQ. The scheme will cost approximately £30 million with a contribution of £3 million each from Exeter City Council and Devon County Council plus £6 million of government growth funding. The remainder will be financed from flood defence grant in aid. ENDS"
/government/news/south-west-highways-prosecuted-for-land-drainage-offences,"South West Highways has been fined for failing to get permission before carrying out repairs to a road bridge in north Devon.  South West Highways prosecuted for land drainage offences  Environment Agency South West Highways has been ordered to pay more than £11,000 in fines and costs. The case was brought by the Environment Agency. In 2013 the company carried out repairs on Kersham Bridge at Bridge Reeve near Chulmleigh. The work required the erection of scaffolding in the River Taw under 2 of the bridge’s 3 arches. South West Highways was expected to start work on 19 August and take approximately 4 weeks. Land drainage consent was obtained from the Environment Agency. Just before work commenced South West Highways were asked if they could also paint part of the bridge. This additional work required scaffolding to be erected under all three arches and for it to be positioned closer to the water. This change in the work plan considerably increased the degree of obstruction and risk of flooding. The company failed to obtain permission for the revised work. A court heard how the repairs weren’t completed until 25 October 2013 and the scaffolding not finally removed until 26 November. With bad weather forecast, the Environment Agency had earlier contacted South West Highways who said they would make sure the scaffolding was removed by 24 October. On 27 October 2013 a storm struck and the river level rose. Debris became entangled in the scaffolding that acted like a dam. The river upstream of the bridge was several feet higher than downstream, causing the river to burst its bank. A nearby property flooded leaving the owner, a man in his 80’s, stranded upstairs. His home was left badly damaged. The Environment Agency had telephoned the gentleman the previous afternoon (27 October) to give a flood warning, but he didn’t answer his phone. It was the worst flooding he’d ever experienced at the property. Pamela Meadows for the Environment Agency said: Care must be taken in the erection of temporary structures in rivers such as scaffolding as they can impede flows and increase the risk of flooding. This is especially important during periods of high rainfall as this case clearly shows. If people’s plans change after obtaining permission, they must come back to us. South West Highways Ltd was fined £5,000 and ordered to pay £3,699 costs after pleading guilty to two Land Drainage byelaw offences. The company was also ordered to pay £2,275 compensation to the man affected by the flooding plus a £120 victim surcharge. The case was heard on 20 June 2014. ENDS"

/government/news/prison-for-waste-land-owner,"Land owner Roger Frederick Phipps, aged 72, has today (Fri 11 Jul) been sent to prison for 6 months. Prison for waste land owner  Environment Agency Chelmsford Crown Court activated part of a suspended sentence given in January last year for a waste offence after he was convicted of a further offence of breaching planning laws. Phipps was sentenced in 2013 to 8 months imprisonment and ordered to carry out 180 hours unpaid work for allowing an illegal waste site to be run on his farm for years. He was also fined £15,000 for breaching 2 planning enforcement notices. The prison sentence was suspended for 2 years. Since then, the court heard, he has carried out the unpaid work but has yet to pay the court costs and fines. He also failed to remove the majority of the waste from the farm by 30 June 2014. Michelins Farm, Rayleigh did not have a waste permit nor planning permission to operate the site and it was run without an environmental permit from April 2008 to 2011. The farm is on green belt land and is within a Landscape Improvement Area. Fires Mr Mark Watson, prosecuting at the earlier hearing, said that between December 2009 and June 2010 Essex County Fire Service attended 35 fires at Michelins Farm, mostly at night when thick black smoke was seen coming from the land. Plastics, tyres, building materials and cylinders were seen in the fires. The fire service was concerned about the risk to adjoining highways, railways and power supplies. Environment Agency officers carried out covert surveillance in May 2010 and saw lorries taking waste into the site and at the same time saw smoke regularly coming from the farm. Officers also went to the farm with police in June following a large fire with a plume of black smoke that could be seen from the A127. Ignored advice Mr Watson said: There was evidence that scrap metal had been removed from the fires and that other waste had been burned in breach of both environmental and planning rules. Long windrows of burned material were found at the site as well as electrical, construction and plastic waste. Judge David Turner said Phipps had been given every opportunity to comply with the law. After the hearing Environment Agency officer Kelly Short said: From photographs it is apparent that significant amounts of waste were taken onto site, stored, sorted and burned. The smoke caused a nuisance and in some cases could have harmed people’s health. Phipps knew he needed a permit to run the site but ignored our advice for years. We continue to work closely with Rochford District Council to stop this site operating illegally."
/government/news/beer-wall-and-river-sowy-drop-in-session,"Plans for works that would prevent the closure of the A372 at times of flood and increase the capacity of the River Sowy will be shared with the public this month.     Beer Wall and River Sowy: Drop-in Session  Environment Agency A drop-in event in Othery Village Hall on Tuesday, 22 July, 3-8pm, is being jointly hosted by the Environment Agency and Somerset County Council as part of engaging with the community on delivering the multi-agency Levels and Moors Flood Action Plan. It will give information about the County Council’s scheme that would see four new culverts built to the east of Langacre Rhyne which runs alongside the Sowy under the A372 at Beer Wall. At times of flood, the culverts would allow water to pass under the road and feed back into the rhyne. Last winter the A372 was flooded at Beer Wall for several weeks and then closed to accommodate emergency pumping. The drop-in event will be a chance for people to find out more information, ask questions and give their comments on the proposed scheme. The Environment Agency will be sharing information about its proposals for channel improvements on the River Sowy and Kings Sedgemoor Drain. All the works aim to increase the capacity of the channels so that in a future flood situations water could more quickly and more effectively diverted from the River Parrett through to Dunball. Graham Quarrier for the Environment Agency said: The Environment Agency project will complement the work started by Somerset County Council. Together they will allow the Sowy to act more efficiently as a flood relief channel and provide benefits across a large area. Cllr Harvey Siggs, Cabinet member for Highways and Transport, said: The closure of this A road, first for flooding and then to accommodate the emergency pumping, caused major disruption for lots of people. Making our infrastructure as flood-proof as possible is a key aim of the Action Plan and this scheme has been designed so that the road would be able to stay open even if we have the same flood levels as last year. The works being discussed at the drop-in event are being undertaken as part of the Somerset Levels and Moors Flood Action Plan. The Plan is being delivered by a range of agencies coordinated by Somerset County Council. The Beer Wall improvements are the responsibility of the County Council. Councillor John Osman, Chairman of the Flood Action Plan Leaders Implementation Group and Leader of Somerset County Council, added: The work of the County Council and the Environment Agency on the Sowy is closely linked and interdependent – it demonstrates of how agencies are working together to deliver the Plan. I urge anyone with an interest to come along to the drop-in and find out more. Ends"

/government/news/anglian-water-to-pay-94000-for-sewage-overflow,"Anglian Water has been fined £50,000 after sewage contaminated a brook through an emergency overflow pipe killing more than 1,500 fish.  Anglian Water to pay £94,000 for sewage overflow  Environment Agency All 3 pumps at Ingrave Pumping Station, near Brentwood, Essex had failed in the early hours of Sunday 10 April 2011 and sewage polluted more than 4 kilometers of the Haverings Grove Brook. A variety of fish species died including bullhead, stoneloach, minnow, stickleback, chub, dace and gudgeon. Many of these species were spawning at the time, so it is likely that the incident had a significant impact on reproduction. The company was also ordered to pay a contribution towards Environment Agency costs of £44,736 and a victim surcharge of £15. The Environment Agency brought the prosecution against Anglian Water, who entered late guilty pleas to breaching 2 conditions of their environmental permit at Chelmsford Magistrates’ Court. The Magistrates committed Anglian Water to the Crown Court at Chelmsford where Anglian Water was sentenced yesterday (Thursday 19 June 2014). Breached permit The permit authorises Anglian Water to discharge sewage to the brook via the emergency overflow pipe in the event of emergency. However, the permit also contains telemetry conditions which apply in the event of an emergency overflow, 2 of these conditions were not complied with. Mr Mark Watson, prosecuting for the Environment Agency, said: “There was a pattern of failure to respond appropriately to alarms and telemetry data in the run up to 10 April 2011.” At the time of the incident, there were 3 pumps at Ingrave Pumping Station. One a day stopped working over 3 days but no alarms were set off. At one point this left the pumping station with no operational pumps for 12 hours. Mr Watson said: “It is clear that at some point after midnight, in the early hours of 10 April 2011, a discharge of crude sewage from the emergency overflow commenced. However, no emergency overflow alarm was ever generated or received”. Gross pollution Ms Sarah Le Fevre, Defence Counsel, said Anglian Water deeply regretted the incident and took some comfort from the scale of the company’s operation with their telemetry system representing one of the largest in Western Europe. At the time of the incident, they were not aware that the wet well alarm was not designed to activate if the pump station was running on the back-up system. Various remedial and precautionary actions have been taken since the incident. Speaking after the case, Environment Agency officer Peter Cooke said: “This pollution was reported to us by a member of the local community who found the brook grossly polluted with sewage. “It had a catastrophic impact on fish and was distressing for local residents who value the brook for its diverse wildlife. After the incident Environment Agency officers were faced with the unpleasant task of removing over 1500 dead fish from the brook, including a significant number of bullhead, a Biodiversity Action Plan species and important food fish for kingfishers and herons.’’ Offences On or about 10 April 2011, at Ingrave Pumping Station, Middle Road, Ingrave, Essex, you being the holder of Environmental Permit number ASENF/1109B, failed to comply with Condition 2.8.2 of the said Permit in that you failed to provide and maintain a 24 hour response telemetry alarm system to give notification in the event of operation of the emergency overflow. Contrary to Regulation 38(2) of the Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2010. Fined £25,000. On or about 10 April 2011, at Ingrave Pumping Station, Middle Road, Ingrave, Essex, you being the holder of Environmental Permit number ASENF/1109B, failed to comply with Condition 2.8.1(b) of the said Permit in that you failed to take all reasonable remedial measures to return the pumping station to normal operation as soon as practicable after receipt of warning of failure or breakdown of the pumping station.

/government/news/man-ordered-to-pay-for-spreading-sewage-rags-and-sanitary-litter,"Waste from cess pits, septic tanks, catch pits and grease traps was tipped on a field in Norfolk, a court was told on Friday (25 July). Man ordered to pay for spreading sewage rags and sanitary litter  Environment Agency Environment Agency officers found sewage rag and sanitary litter spread across a field used by Richard Fiddian, trading as Norfolk Forest Products. They estimated that 491,851gallons (2,236 m3) of waste was deposited on the site over nearly 3 years. Fiddian was ordered by Norwich Crown Court to hand over £20,125 proceeds under the Proceeds of Crime Act and was also fined £750 and ordered to pay full costs of £3,375. Fiddian pleaded guilty at an earlier magistrates’ court hearing and was committed to the crown court for a proceeds of crime application and sentencing. Anne-Lise McDonald, prosecuting for the Environment Agency, told the court that although Fiddian was registered to transport waste legally, his site at North Barningham was not allowed to take it. She said waste including septic tank and cess pit waste had been repeatedly spread over the land between April 2010 and February 2013. She also said: Waste identified on the land included soiled condoms, tampons, sanitary towels, baby wipes, toilet paper and other unidentifiable rag. It smelt strongly of sewage.” Fiddian admitted using the site illegally. Drinking water borehole put at risk Mrs McDonald told the court that the site is in a designated Nitrate Vulnerable Zone, a designation to protect ground water and surface water from contamination. Anglian Water Services also has a borehole nearby and takes water from the area. Mrs McDonald said: High amounts of nitrates in groundwater used for public drinking supplies can be harmful to human health, so water companies have to treat it to makes sure that levels are low. This causes them more expense which will ultimately be passed on to consumers. Fiddian told investigating officers that he did not think he needed a permit to put the waste on the land but Mrs McDonald told the court that he had received 2 letters in 2005 and 2007 advising him of changes in legislation. The court heard that since the offence came to light Fiddian has stopped using the site, has obtained a discharge licence and now takes the waste to a legitimate site for disposal. After the hearing Environment Agency officer Jack Colman said: Because we uncovered this illegal site and the defendant now disposes of his waste legally, the environment has been protected. Waste crime is a serious offence with tough penalties. It can damage the environment, blight local communities and undermine those who operate legally."
/government/news/45-million-flood-defence-repair-work-well-underway,"A £4.5 million programme of work is well under way to repair flood defences in Midlands damaged by high tides and river levels during winter. £4.5 million flood defence repair work well underway  Environment Agency The work will be delivered using additional funding from central government and will take place across Gloucestershire, Herefordshire, Worcestershire and Shropshire. A number of repair projects have already been completed and others are progressing well. Repairs to the damage are planned to be completed by the end of October this year to ensure that these flood defences are ready for any floods or high tides that may occur during the winter months. Permanent repairs to the Priding flood wall which protects 30 properties in Framilode on the River Severn in Gloucestershire have already been completed. In Hampton Bishop, Herefordshire 150 metres of damaged flood embankment have been repaired and similar work has been completed on a flood embankment at Ark Corner in Melverley, Shropshire. The three largest projects, which are expected to cost over £500,000 each, at Minsterworth, the Rea Flood Bank and Lapper Ditch Outfall, Gloucestershire are scheduled to start on site in August and September. Phil Foxley from the Environment Agency said: “This significant programme of maintenance and repair work is extremely important as it means our flood defences can continue to reduce the risk of flooding to the communities that they protect. The recovery work, which is in addition to our annual routine maintenance and inspection programme, is on schedule to be completed by the end of October this year."

/government/news/flood-defence-investigation-work-starts-in-epney-gloucestershire,"Today (Friday 8 August), the Environment Agency will begin investigation work on a flood defence wall in Epney, Gloucestershire. Flood defence investigation work starts in Epney, Gloucestershire  Environment Agency The flood wall provides protection to 292 properties in the area. The team carrying out the work will remove some of the outer layer bricks from the flood wall. These bricks on the outside of the flood wall were added during the construction so that the wall was in keeping with the local area, but behind it lies a concrete brick wall which provides the flood protection. This removal will allow the team to inspect the internal concrete wall while water from the high tide is up against it. Removing the outer layer of bricks will not affect the integrity of the flood defence so it will continue to protect the community in Epney. The bricks will be replaced once minor repairs have been carried out to prevent leakage on the wall. This work will start in mid August. Phil Foxley from the Environment Agency said: “This investigation is an essential part of our flood recovery work. It will allow us to check the integrity of this wall so that it can continue to protect the community in Epney on the River Severn.

/government/news/tenth-anniversary-of-boscastle-and-north-cornwall-floods,"Some of the worst floods ever seen in Britain devastated Boscastle and surrounding areas of North Cornwall ten years ago on 16 August, 2004. Tenth anniversary of Boscastle and North Cornwall Floods  Environment Agency Two million tonnes of water flowed through Boscastle caused by 5 hours of torrential rain. The flash floods affected hundreds of homes and businesses, destroyed 4 properties in Boscastle and 2 at Crackington Haven, swept away about 115 vehicles and badly damaged roads, bridges, sewers and other infrastructure. The Environment Agency worked with professional partners to remove around 4,000 tonnes of flood debris from Boscastle, including shingle which had been deposited in the village. More than £10 million of improvements were carried out. The Agency worked with Cornwall Council’s predecessors, the National Trust, Forrabury and Minster parish council, the Chamber of Trade and Commerce and South West Water to develop flood defence schemes for both the River Valency and River Jordan as part of the village’s post flood regeneration. Flood schemes were upgraded in the nearby communities of Canworthy Water and Helebridge. The defences and regeneration works in Boscastle were sympathetically designed to respect the historic character of the village and reduce the risk of property flooding. The work was partly funded by the European Objective One as well as flood defence grant in aid. Local levy funding was used to fund the upgrade to defences in Canworthy Water. The Valency scheme included widening and deepening of the river and replacing the lower bridge to increase flow capacity. The main car park was raised and set back from the river to make space for water and sediment and a new tree management regime was introduced to reduce the risk of tree blockage. The Jordan flood defence scheme involved installing a flood relief culvert behind Marine Terrace, down Old Road, via a new dissipation chamber. The Environment Agency also worked with Cornwall Highways to carry out flood risk improvements at a number of culverted highway crossings on the upper reaches of the River Jordan. A stone catcher was installed above Paradise Road to reduce the chance of the new highway culverts blocking. Andrew Houghton from the Environment Agency said: Since their completion the new defences have worked successfully to protect communities across Boscastle and North Cornwall on several occasions, notably in 2010 and 2012. We have worked closely with people in Boscastle and other such rapid response catchments to raise awareness of the flood risk in these areas and develop community flood plans. Local residents and businesses in these catchments have been helped to achieve greater flood resilience and this work is ongoing. The Environment Agency recently introduced a bespoke flood warning service for Boscastle which uses information from rain and river gauges in the area. Ends"
/government/news/disease-infects-native-white-clawed-crayfish-in-river-allen,"Crayfish plague has been found on Dorset’s River Allen following an investigation by the Environment Agency and Dorset Wildlife Trust. Disease infects native White-clawed crayfish in River Allen  Environment Agency Until recently the river Allen’s native White-clawed crayfish population, one of the few remaining in Dorset, has managed to remain free from disease but dead and distressed crayfish were recently spotted in the river in July. Samples were sent to the Centre for Environment Fisheries and Aquaculture Science for disease analysis and they have now confirmed that the crayfish are infected with crayfish plague. Andy Martin for the Environment Agency said: The crayfish plague is carried by non-native American signal crayfish, which are not susceptible to it and are present in many of our Dorset Rivers. It is transferred to new waters either through the movement of the signal crayfish or by water and/or damp equipment that has come from waters that contain signal crayfish. It is not clear yet how the disease reached the River Allen. American Signal Crayfish look similar to small lobsters, they are red-brown in appearance with large, smooth claws. They are far larger than the endangered native white-clawed crayfish. They carry a fungal disease called crayfish plague, which can kill native crayfish. They are active during the summer and hibernate in winter, usually in burrows in riverbanks. They outcompete our native White-Clawed Crayfish for food. They also cause damage to riverbanks by deep burrowing, impact on river fly populations and can reduce fish stocks by eating large amounts of fish eggs. The Environment Agency is working closely with the Dorset Wildlife Trust and local landowners to monitor the situation and determine the extent of the outbreak. Dorset Wildlife Trust Conservation Officer, Amanda Broom, said: It is very sad that White Clawed Crayfish have been infected with the crayfish plague on the River Allen, as this was one of just three populations remaining in Dorset. However, by remaining vigilant and observing biosecurity procedures such as cleaning and drying equipment and shoes that have been near the river, hopefully we can limit the amount of crayfish being affected by this disease. Whilst we can’t be sure of the fate of the surviving crayfish, the work we are doing on the River Allen with the Environment Agency, such as providing cover for crayfish to hide in, will provide any surviving white clawed crayfish a good habitat to thrive in. Andy Martin, for the Agency, added: We are urging river users to ensure that any equipment they use in the River Allen is clean and dry before entering the river, when moving between locations and at the end of the day. This will hopefully limit the rate of spread of the disease through the river and reduce the risk of it being spread to other rivers that still have white-clawed crayfish populations. Ends Editor’s Notes: The White-clawed crayfish is the UK’s only native crayfish species and is designated as “endangered” on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red list of threatened species. Non native invasive species of crayfish, mainly the American signal crayfish, have been the main reason for the rapid decline in our native White-claws. This is mainly due to their ability to out-compete for habitat and food and because they carry a deadly mould called crayfish plague (Aphanomyces astaci) which the natives are not immune to. This disease can be spread between rivers and lakes on damp and muddy equipment. It is vital that any river / lake user follows the Check, Clean and Dry biosecurity measures before entering a watercourse. In response to the severe decline of native White-clawed crayfish in South West England, The South West Crayfish Project was set up. The project is a partnership between the Environment Agency, Buglife, Avon Wildlife Trust and Bristol Zoo. The project involves re-homing at-risk populations of White-clawed crayfish to new safe havens known as Ark sites, monitoring existing populations and captive breeding populations at Bristol Zoological Gardens. Last year good numbers of White-claws from the River Allen were translocated to a safe isolated stream away from the threat of any non-native crayfish species. This population will be monitored in future years to determine the success of the project. Other opportunities are also being investigated for any remaining potentially healthy White-claws in the River Allen."
/government/news/flood-excercise-whilst-you-were-sleeping,"The Environment Agency has been out practicing its emergency response to high tides in Kings Lynn this morning (13 August 2014) to ensure staff are familiar with emergency procedures to prevent the town flooding.  Flood exercise - while you were sleeping  Environment Agency Environment Agency forecasting teams monitored weather forecasts ahead of this week’s predicted high tides to assess the possibility of a surge tide. Fortunately, despite the tail end of Hurricane Bertha hitting earlier this week, the weather conditions have been favourable and these spring tides don’t present a real risk. In line with agreed procedures, the Environment Agency had already taken some precautionary steps earlier in the week ahead of the high tides, by installing dam boards at Ouse House and by lifting the bench seats at Kings Staithe Square. Alan Daniels, Environment Agency Operations Team Leader for Kings Lynn, said: Having seen the forecast for the morning’s tide yesterday and despite this now coming in under the predicted level and our normal trigger level for response on the ground, we decided to take the opportunity to exercise our staff. The exercise went well. While most people were sleeping we opened our Kings Lynn incident room at 02:50 to oversee the activity. Our teams were in town by 05:50 closing all flood gates, where access was nonessential, ahead of high water which was expected at 08:48. Our Coastal Patrol did have to wake 5 sleeping teenagers who were camping on the beach at Hunstanton – rather us wake them at 6am than the waves a few hours later. The boys were all happy to vacate, once we’d explained the situation and advised them that future camping excursions would be more successful if they had a better understanding of the local tides. This week’s tides are known as spring tides. These occur around the new and full moon when the gravitational pull of the moon is stronger. If a Spring tide is accompanied by low pressure and strong winds a surge can be created where low pressure sucks the surface of the water up and causes a tide to come in higher. Kings Lynn’s flood defences were severely tested on 5 December when these conditions last occurred causing the East Coast Tidal Surge. Kings Lynn experienced its highest sea levels in recent history exceeding both 1953 and 1978 levels."

/government/news/anglers-joy-as-grayling-return-to-leicestershire-river,"Anglers on the River Sence in Leicestershire are excited after catching a species of fish which disappeared from the area over 40 years ago. Anglers' joy as grayling return to Leicestershire river  Environment Agency Grayling are now returning to the River Sence near Ibstock thanks to a series of improvement projects carried out by the Environment Agency, Gopsall Fishing Club, the Wild Trout Trust, the Grayling Society and other partner organisations in the local area. These works have significantly improved the quality of the water in the River Sence and improved the fish’s natural habitat – encouraging them to migrate and spawn. The improvement works involved creating fish spawning areas and designing new channels to enable fish to migrate around impassable weirs. Large woody debris was also added to help prevent silt from building up in the river – by varying the river flow and keeping the gravel clean to encourage fish to spawn. 3km of fencing was erected to prevent livestock from entering the river and prevent over grazing on the river banks. From 2006 to 2010 the Environment Agency worked alongside Gopsall Fishing Club and the Grayling Society to kick start the grayling population by stocking over 8,500 grayling – reared at the Environment Agency’s fish farm at Calverton. Tom Astley, Environment Agency, said: “We’re delighted to see that the fish we stocked with Gopsall Fishing Club, the Wild Trout Trust and the Grayling Society have reached maturity and are now spawning in the river. We hope that over time the grayling population in this area will go from strength to strength. This is a great example of one of the many projects we deliver as a result of rod licence fee funding. It is part of our nationwide aim to conserve and improve wild stocks of trout, sea trout, char and grayling - whilst also enhancing the environment for all types of fisheries.” Peter Owen, Chairman of Gopsall Fishing Club, said: “This season our members have reported the capture of the first naturally spawned wild grayling in the river. This is fantastic news as it demonstrates that all the hard work put in by the club and its partners has restored the habitat that can once again support a self-sustaining grayling population. It also provides us with some winter fishing beyond the end of the trout season.” In addition to the work delivered by the Environment Agency, Gopsall Angling Club have also continued to improve the area with other partners organisations such as the Wild Trout Trust, the Grayling Society, Twycross Zoo, Leicestershire & Rutland Wildlife Trust, Bardon Aggregates, the Crown Estate and farmers.

Environment Agency stages open morning on Somerset Levels  Environment Agency The Agency has dredged a 4 kilometre length of river (8 km of total river bank length) on the Parrett and Tone and removed 80,000 tonnes of silt and remain on target to finish the work by the end of October this year. People are being invited to drop in to the main dredge compound at Samway’s, Riverside, Burrowbridge, Bridgwater, Somerset, on Saturday 30 August, between 10am and 12.30pm to talk to experts about the dredging operation and its part in the 20-year-plan. Everyone will also be given the opportunity to explore inside one of the excavators used during the dredging operation. Graham Quarrier for the Environment Agency: We would ask people to come along to find out more about the dredging and the other work we are completing in the local area. As well as completing the dredge, we are repairing local ‘assets’ like river banks and pumping stations that were damaged in the floods. These repairs include work mentioned in the 20 year plan for the Somerset levels and moors. The dredging is being undertaken using a mixture of floating equipment, large excavators mounted on the riverbanks and even amphibious dredgers. This range of equipment is needed to cope with the large tidal range in the river and the soft ground conditions on the banks. A fleet of tractors and trailers, many driven by local farmers, are carrying the silt away for spreading on agricultural land or for flood bank strengthening. A crop has already been harvested from the first fields that the silt was spread on, back in April.

/government/news/work-begins-on-exeter-flood-defence-scheme,"The first phase of Exeter’s £30 million flood defence scheme has begun this week with works to deepen the Trew’s flood relief channel.  Work begins on Exeter Flood Defence Scheme  Environment Agency When finished the new scheme will reduce flood risk to approximately 3,000 homes and businesses throughout the city. Phase one will include deepening the existing flood relief channel, lowering the spill weir at the top of Trew’s flood relief channel and removing the ‘check weir’ at the bottom of the channel. These works will increase the flow capacity of the flood relief channel. Large dumper trucks will be used to remove excavated material from the flood relief channel. The material will be temporarily stored on Bromham’s Farm playing field, close to the construction site compound. The material will then be re-used during phase two of the project. This will help reduce construction traffic bringing in new material. Other improvements include the construction of a meandering stream through the centre of the flood relief channel, construction of fish passes on Trew’s weir and a low level pedestrian access across the middle of the flood relief channel. George Arnison for the Environment Agency, said: There will be a lot of heavy machinery arriving on site and this will cause some disruption, but we hope people will understand why we need to carry out the work in order to reduce flood risk to people and properties in Exeter. We will do all we can to minimise the disruption. Steps taken to minimise disruption include: Continued public access to the ‘island’ between the River Exe and the Trew’s flood relief channel during construction. Allotment users will still be able to access their plots The footpath and cyclepath alongside Trew’s Flood Relief Channel will remain open. However, there will be some unavoidable delays due to dumper truck movements across the path. Signs have been placed to direct people to alternative routes alongside Exeter Canal. George Arnison added: Construction sites are dangerous, this is why fencing has been installed around the site to keep the public separate from construction vehicles and equipment. When the work is completed the fencing will be removed and the soil storage area will be reinstated as a field. Cllr Rachel Sutton, Exeter City Council’s Lead Councillor for City Development, said: I am delighted that work has begun on this important defence for the city. The scheme will protect homes and businesses in Exeter and also bring some improvements to the area to enhance wildlife diversity in a beautiful part of Exeter that is much loved and very well used. Councillor Andrew Leadbetter, Devon County Council Cabinet Member for Economy and Growth and Cabinet Liaison for Exeter, said: This is an important first step in this scheme and we’re pleased to see work underway. The new defences are vital to the economy of Exeter and it will provide flood relief to hundreds of householders and businesses in the city. The Environment Agency and its partners, Devon County Council and Exeter City Council have already held a series of public exhibitions to seek people’s views about the designs for phase two of the scheme. Work on phase two is planned to start in Autumn 2015 and the designs are still being worked on but people can stay up-to-date with the latest plans for the scheme by visiting www.gov.uk and searching for Exeter Flood. Anyone can share their views with the project team by emailing ExeterFDS@environment-agency.gov.uk or writing to Exeter Flood Defence Scheme, Manley House, Kestrel Way, Exeter, EX2 7LQ.

/government/news/oldbury-man-sentenced-for-running-illegal-waste-operation,"Balwant Singh Baghria was sentenced at Wolverhampton Crown Court for his part in illegal waste operations in West Midlands. Oldbury man sentenced for running illegal waste operation  Environment Agency Balwant Singh Baghria, also known as ‘Bob’, was sentenced on Friday 11 July 2014 to 12 months imprisonment suspended for 2 years and disqualified from being a company director for 7 years for his part in an illegal waste operation at Nelson Street and Parsonage Street, Oldbury, West Midlands. Confiscation proceedings and costs will be determined at a later date this year. His co-defendants Ranbir Singh, also known as ‘Ravinder’ and ‘Nick’, Reginald Baldwin and Langley Skip Hire (Midlands) Ltd were sentenced at an earlier hearing. Sentencing Balwant Baghria, His Honour Judge Walsh, said that the custody threshold was passed to a significant degree but he would suspend the sentence of imprisonment owing to his age and ill-health, Background The charges were brought by the Environment Agency under the Environmental Permitting (England & Wales) Regulations 2010 and the Environmental Protection Act 1990. Prosecuting for the Environment Agency, Counsel Mr Nicholas Cole told the Court that between the period July 2010 and July 2012, the defendants engaged in large scale, commercial tipping operations at two sites in Oldbury. Substantial amounts of waste were deposited at ‘The Yard’, Nelson Street and ‘Butler’s Yard’, Parsonage Street in Oldbury. Initially, the site at Nelson Street, Oldbury, operated as a fully permitted facility with an environmental permit in place. However, over a period of time the site deposited and stored waste over and above the maximum storage capacities, to dangerous levels. In addition, waste was then deposited illegally on land opposite, known as Butler’s Yard, where there was no environmental permit in force. Father and son Balwant Singh Baghria and Ranbir Singh operated both sites under the company name Langley Skip Hire (Midlands) Ltd. When Ranbir Singh resigned as a director, Reginald Baldwin became the sole director of the company, although by this time the waste had been deposited at both sites. Despite interventions from the Environment Agency, Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and Sandwell Planning Authority, operations continued. The service of a prohibition notice by the HSE in July 2011 and Stop Notices by Sandwell Planning Authority in March and December 2011 did not deter the defendants from continuing to deposit waste at both sites. Officers from the Environment Agency undertook a surveillance operation in order to gather evidence in support of a prosecution. Operations finally ceased when Ranbir Singh was arrested in July 2011. The Environment Agency incurred costs of over £101,000 to clear some of the waste at Nelson Street to prevent damage being caused to a neighbouring business, due to the pressure of the waste pile on the wall of an adjacent building. Sandwell Planning Authority incurred costs of around £4,600 for clearing waste from the highway outside both sites. The remaining waste at Nelson Street was removed by the landowner at a cost of approximately £35,000. Waste at Butler’s Yard, Parsonage Street remains in situ to this day. It has caused problems with odour, has attracted rats and has been infested with crickets which have caused nuisance to neighbouring businesses. The cost of removal is yet to be determined by estimates are between £320,000 and £1,000,000. The estimated volume of waste has been calculated at 6,000 cubic metres, weighing about 3,000 tonnes. A timetable has been set in relation to confiscation proceedings under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 in relation to the financial gain made by Balwant Singh Baghria and Ranbir Singh throughout the offending period. The benefit gained in respect of operating and disposal costs alone are calculated to be in the region of £230,000. Confiscation will be dealt with at a future Court hearing. Speaking after the case, David Hudson, Environment Manager said: “In the past few months, we have seen a marked toughening in sentences passed by the Courts. Many have led to prison sentences. As well as causing nuisance to local residents these cases leave financial victims where landowners foot the bill for clearing the sites. We are increasingly using the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 to trace the money made by their illegal trade and to make polluters pay for their actions.” Waste crime information For more information about the action we are taking to reduce waste crime, visit our website at www.environment-agency.gov.uk/wastecrime.

/government/news/tyne-and-wear-scrap-metal-firm-fined-3000-over-disruptive-air-pollution,"Emission of chemical fumes affected residents and businesses in Swalwell 2 years ago. Tyne and Wear scrap metal firm fined £3,000 over disruptive air pollution  Environment Agency A Tyne and Wear metals recycling company has been fined £3,000 over an air pollution incident that caused disruption to residents and businesses in Swalwell. J&J Stanley Ltd was sentenced by Newcastle Magistrates on 29 April following an emission of chemical fumes from its site on Longrigg Road, Swalwell, 2 years ago. On the evening of 26 April 2012, the police and fire brigade received reports of a strong chemical smell in the area. The odour was so strong that the police closed nearby roads to vehicles and pedestrians, and they also visited local residents to advise them to keep windows and doors shut. Chris Bunting, prosecuting for the Environment Agency, told the court that Tyne and Wear Fire and Rescue Service attended the scene with six pumping appliances and specialist incident support units. Complaints came in from a local pub, where people could no longer sit outdoors, and a takeaway business was advised to close for the evening. The Environment Agency tracked the source of the smell to a 10-tonne pile of aluminium waste, a recyclable residue known as dross, which had been deposited in the company’s yard. When investigating officers visited the site, they could smell a chemical odour in the air, and a fizzing sound was heard, indicating that a chemical reaction was taking place in the aluminium waste pile. The waste pile had been left uncovered and exposed to rainfall, which may have started the reaction. Some of the material had been moved into a covered storage skip to contain the smell, and when the cover was pulled back for an inspection, the fumes caused an officer’s eyes to immediately water. In court, J&J Stanley Ltd admitted an offence of depositing controlled waste in a manner likely to cause pollution or harm to human health. Sophie Webster, environment management team leader at the Environment Agency, said after the case: The chemical odour that the Swalwell community experienced in April 2012 was strong and unpleasant. The emission of the fumes affected residents and businesses, and the emergency services spent valuable time and effort responding to the incident to ensure that people were not put at risk. J&J Stanely’s poor handling of its waste aluminium was the cause of the pollution, and as such this incident could have been avoided, had appropriate procedures been followed. The fine imposed by the court demonstrates the seriousness of environmental offences. Industrial operations of this nature can pose a risk to the environment and local communities if they are not properly managed – that’s why it is vital that companies work within the rules. In addition to the fine, J&J Stanley Ltd was ordered to pay £3,015.10 in costs and a victim surcharge of £120."

Environment Agency People and businesses of Port Clarence and Greatham South are invited to a public drop-in to find out more about a proposed flood defence scheme for the town. The Environment Agency is hosting the event at High Clarence Primary School on Thursday 3 July, from 3.30pm to 7pm. Those who attend will be able to talk to the project team about the flood risk faced by Port Clarence, and the new defence scheme that the Environment Agency is now planning to build. The project will involve the building of new defences and improvements to existing defences around Port Clarence and Greatham South. The project will improve the standard of protection to properties that are at risk. Construction is programmed to start in spring 2015. Some 351 homes and 32 commercial properties are at risk of flooding in Port Clarence. This risk comes from the River Tees and Greatham Creek. The most recent impact of flooding in Port Clarence was seen in December last year, when a tidal surge combined with high spring tides. An estimated 45 residential properties and six commercial properties were flooded."
/government/news/flood-defence-improvements-for-stanhope,"Public drop-in to be held on Monday 11 August at the Durham Dales Centre Flood defence improvements for Stanhope  Environment Agency People who live in Stanhope, County Durham, are being invited to come and talk to flood risk experts about a defence improvement scheme for the town. The Environment Agency will be holding a public drop-in event on Monday 11 August at the Durham Dales Centre in Castle Gardens from 3pm to 7pm, giving local people the chance to find out more about the project. The Environment Agency is proposing to raise some sections of its defences on the River Wear to improve flood protection to 100 homes that are at risk. Chris Wotherspoon, project manager for the Environment Agency, said: This work will improve flood defences in Stanhope to provide a more uniform standard of protection from the River Wear. There are defences along this part of the River Wear but these offer different standards of protection, so we are looking to raise some defences and improve their general condition. Anyone who wants to know more about the scheme is invited to our public drop-in on the 11th. Our flood risk and project officers will be there to answer any questions. The work will include the raising of an embankment at Butts Crescent, and increasing the height and strength of existing walls at Butts House and Wear Terrace. No start date has yet been set for the work, but it is expected to be carried out this financial year. Some 21 properties were flooded in Stanhope in January 1995, when river levels rose following heavy rainfall. After this, the Environment Agency constructed new flood defences to improve protection, and these significantly limited the damage caused by a rainfall event in January of 2005, when the Wear reached higher levels at Stanhope than they did in 1995. This year’s project, designed using new modelling data, will improve these defences even further. They will be able to withstand river levels even higher than those seen in the 2005 incident."
/government/news/ripon-flood-warning-service-updated,"Warning areas increased following major flood defence works. Ripon flood warning service updated  Environment Agency The Environment Agency has updated the flood warning service in Ripon following the £14.4 million investment Ripon Flood Alleviation Scheme on the Rivers Ure, Skell and Laver which includes the Laver Dam. Using new modelling data, the Environment Agency has split Ripon’s three existing flood warning areas into five, providing more localised and specific warnings for residents. Warning areas have also been expanded to include an additional 132 properties, and local flood warning triggers have been fine-tuned to provide even more timely warnings. Flood Risk officer at the Environment Agency, Zoe Pattinson said: Following the significant investment in Ripon by the Environment Agency, it is excellent news that we are able to offer more specific warnings to the local community. The updated warnings will be of even more use to people in Ripon, giving them more localised and timely information that will allow them to better prepare for a flood, should the risk be present. The updates include extending the service to include properties where essential access to properties is at risk of flooding and removing other properties no longer at flood risk following the construction of the new flood defences. We have worked with Harrogate Borough Council to improve the accuracy of the warnings sent, flood warning areas been amended, increasing the timeliness of the warnings sent. This summer marks the second anniversary of the construction of the dam at Birkby Nab on the River Laver. The Laver Dam constricts the river flow to help reduce the amount of water flowing through Ripon and has already been used on several occasions to help reduce flood risk in Ripon. The improvements to the flood defences reduced the risk of flooding to 548 residential properties and 96 business properties. Here is some of the work that was completed in 2012, as part of the £14.4m investment: Alma Weir has been lowered to improve river flow and restore a more natural river gradient. Over the last few weeks, the Environment Agency have been doing ongoing maintenance works to remove gravel from the radar river level and flow gauge upstream of Alma Weir. New earth embankments have been built at North Bridge up to four metres high, two flood arches have been cleared of debris underneath the bridge and sections of River View Road have been raised. At Fisher Green, one-metre high embankments and gabion walls have been built along the river bank. Along Borrage Lane, an embankment was built behind 15 properties to create a continuous line of defence to strengthen and fill in gaps in the previous piecemeal defences. The Environment Agency’s flood maps show the risk of flooding for all types of land. The flood warning areas are specific to every community and more information can be found on our website . If you are concerned about getting insurance for your property, you can find advice on the Environment Agency’s website and through the National Flood Forum or call 01299 403055. Although this work has been done, the risk of flooding can never be completely removed. This is where it is important for residents to be aware of the flood risk posed to their properties and consider how to minimise the impact of flooding if it was to happen.

/government/news/sutton-harbour-swing-bridge-to-close-for-essential-repairs--2,"The pedestrian swing bridge over the lock gates at Sutton Harbour in Plymouth is to be closed from Tuesday 20th May for six weeks to allow for the replacement of an essential bearing. Sutton Harbour swing bridge to close for essential repairs  Environment Agency The bridge operates independently of the harbour’s lock gates so access for vessels will be unaffected. An alternative pedestrian route is available around the perimeter of the harbour and will be clearly signposted. The decision to close the bridge follows engineering investigatory works by the Environment Agency, which has joint maintenance responsibility for the bridge with harbour owner and operator Sutton Harbour Holdings Plc. The issue relates to the bridge’s slew bearing, which is the main component on which the bridge pivots. This has recently been discovered to be worn and without replacement will result in the bridge becoming jammed, potentially blocking the harbour entrance. The Environment Agency has therefore advised that the bridge be closed at the end of a three week notice period which starts today (29th April). The repair is expected to take six weeks from the end of the notice period, which means the bridge would re-open at the beginning of July. Dave Turner from the Environment Agency said: > We don’t want to take the risk of the bridge jamming resulting in a much larger repair and impeding harbour traffic, which would mean it having to close for longer. Giving users notice now before the school holidays is the best course of action. Pete Bromley, Harbour Master of Sutton Harbour, said: > This is an essential repair to ensure safe passage of pedestrians in the short term. Longer term it is highly likely that the bridge will need to be replaced in its entirety. There will inevitably be some inconvenience for users but recent investment by Sutton Harbour Holdings in the harbour’s Heritage Trail means there is an alternative route and this will be clearly signposted. The replacement slew bearing, which is contained within a sealed unit, is having to be specifically manufactured. This means the faulty bearing must be removed first and transported to a specialist firm in Wiltshire before work on the new bespoke bearing can begin. The swing bridge will be temporarily closed this Thursday 1st May from 8.30am until 12.30pm to allow for some routine maintenance and further engineering investigations, but is then expected to operate as normal until the six-week closure from 20th May."
/government/news/water-voles-return-to-every-county-in-england,"Introduction of water voles to Cornwall sees them return to every county in England for the first time since 1989. Water voles return to every county in England  Environment Agency Wildlife experts at the Environment Agency have confirmed that water voles have returned to every county in England, following the final release of 60 captive bred voles within the Bude river catchment in Cornwall. The release, by the Environment Agency and Westland Countryside Stewards, means that there is now an established breeding vole colony in Cornwall, the first time since 1989. There are now breeding colonies in every county in England. The introduction programme began in 2013 as water voles were highly unlikely to naturally colonise in Cornwall due to the distance to the next nearest population in East Devon. Water vole populations have been in decline since the 1970s due to long-term habitat loss, predation by American mink and extreme weather. Statistics released by the Environment Agency and wildlife trusts last year showed that the populations could have fallen by as much as a fifth since 2011. Populations in the south west, Lake District and parts of the Midlands are especially vulnerable. However, reintroduction schemes combined with mink control programmes and habitat management are providing a lifeline for this iconic species. Creating and maintaining large-scale good quality habitat is also key to ensuring the species’ survival. Alastair Driver, the Environment Agency’s National Conservation Manager and Chair of the UK Water Vole Steering Group, said: Habitat creation and restoration projects are hugely valuable for most wildlife, there are some species for which introduction programmes are necessary simply because populations have become so fragmented and the species is not very mobile. The Environment Agency has created nearly 5,000 hectares of wetland and river habitats in the last 10 years, and worked hard to tackle unsustainable abstraction from our rivers, to the extent that some 55 billion litres of water each year is now returned to the environment. However we are keen to support carefully located water vole release projects as well, but only as long as there is rigorous control of American mink in the catchment. This is essential if the populations of water voles are to benefit from these healthier rivers and new habitats. Water voles were successfully released into the River Axe in Devon in 2009 and are known to have thrived there ever since, thanks to careful management of the habitat and control of American mink. John Duncan, Chief Executive of the charity Westland Countryside Stewards, said: It has been a privilege to play a part in the release of water voles back into a Cornish habitat where they were once a common sight. The success of the project is a great demonstration of the way a small local charity such as ours can work with larger organisations like the Environment Agency to achieve a common goal."
/government/news/bringing-salmon-back-to-south-yorkshire,"New fish pass will allow fish to migrate further towards Sheffield Bringing salmon back to South Yorkshire  Environment Agency Salmon and sea trout could soon be returning further into South Yorkshire thanks to a major engineering project on the River Don. The Environment Agency has built a £500,000 fish and eel pass at Sprotbrough Weir, near Doncaster, allowing fish to migrate upstream as far as Rotherham, and also into the River Dearne. Salmon were once so common on the River Don that they provided an affordable meal and formed a staple part of the local diet. But in the 18th Century a number of weirs were built along the river for industry or to regulate water levels for boats. These prevented salmon, lamprey and eels from migrating, and any coarse fish like barbel that are washed over a weir during high waters cannot return back upstream. Pollution from industry during the 19th and 20th Centuries then made the river uninhabitable for most wildlife. The Sprotbrough fish pass is part of a wider programme of work which will improve the river for coarse fish and eel and also return salmon to the centre of Sheffield. There are 14 further weirs between Sprotbrough and Sheffield, and five of these are already passable to fish. Plans are underway with the Don Catchment Rivers Trust to adapt five weirs in the near future, and the Environment Agency is working with its partners to look at the options for the remaining structures. The Sprotbrough project was funded by the Environment Agency, supported by income from rod licence fees, plus a significant contribution from Lafarge Tarmac through the Landfill Community Fund. The fish pass will be maintained by the Canal & River Trust, which owns the weir and has supported the delivery of the project, along with the Don Catchment Rivers Trust and the Don Gorge Community Group. Nick Soames, project manager at the Environment Agency, said: This is a significant step in getting salmon to Sheffield and restoring sustainable populations of coarse fish to the River Don. The effects of industrial pollution and habitat loss have been reversed, and we are now also starting to restore habitats. Our rivers are the healthiest they have been for 20 years, and wildlife is now returning to many watercourses for the first time in decades. It’s timely that we can announce this as we approach World Fish Migration Day, on Saturday 24 May, that aims to highlight the work going on around the globe to help fish that migrate. Jane Thomson, Enterprise Manager at the Canal & River Trust, said: As owners of Sprotbrough Weir, the Trust are pleased to have worked with the Environment Agency, the local community and Lafarge Tarmac to facilitate a new fish pass which will be critical in the improving the river for wildlife and providing visitors with an added attraction in the Don Gorge.

/government/news/river-wear-salmon-rod-catch-beats-all-records,"2013 catch figures buck the national trend. River Wear salmon rod catch beats all records  Environment Agency Record numbers of salmon were captured by anglers fishing the River Wear in 2013. Environment Agency officers have just finished collating the rod catch return data from last year and they were delighted to find that catches on the Wear have hit an all time high. Catch data show that salmon stocks are the best they have ever been, with a record 1,731 fish reported by anglers in 2013, compared to the previous best of 1,613 in 2011. Sea trout catches on the Wear were also up last year. Catches rose from 1,427 in 2012 to 1,523 in 2013. The River Wear was one of the few rivers in England that actually bucked the trend of reduced catches in 2013. This dip in figures was caused by the dry summer, which can hamper fish passage over weirs and reduce angling success. Paul Frear, fisheries technical officer at the Environment Agency, said: The 2013 fish catches are a real surprise. They show that, despite low river levels, the Wear can still produce great catches for anglers. Recent improvements in water quality and river habitats have contributed to these catches. Salmon are in important part of our rivers’ ecology and they are a valuable economic fish stock, so this is fantastic news for the North East. Fifty years ago, very few salmon or sea trout were seen in the Wear because the river was too polluted. Due to the successful efforts of the Environment Agency and its partners, the River Wear’s water quality is one of the most improved in the country. The Environment Agency monitors rod catches of salmon and sea trout from rivers nationally, and the data show the River Wear is second only to the neighbouring Tyne as the best salmon river in England and Wales."

/government/news/drainage-work-begins-on-todmordens-centre-vale-park,"Project will take about 12 weeks to complete Drainage work begins on Todmorden’s Centre Vale Park  Environment Agency Work to rectify persistent drainage problems in Todmorden’s Centre Vale Park will begin next week (22 September). The park has a long history of poor drainage which, from time to time, leaves some parts of it unusable. It had been hoped that the problems would be cured when new drainage was installed in 2007 as part of an Environment Agency scheme to create a flood storage area in the park to help protect the town centre from flooding from the River Calder. However, the problems have continued and the Environment Agency and Calderdale Council, which owns the park, have secured funds to enable the rectification work to go ahead. The main problem is that some of the slit drains which connect the surface of the park to the drainage layers underneath have become blocked. Slit drains are vertical columns and sand and gravel which allow water to drain towards an underground pipe network. Investigations have shown that water cannot drain away because, over time, the upper sand layers of the drains have become displaced by surrounding soil which has high clay content and, therefore, acts as a barrier to the dispersal of water. The rectification work will cost £150,000 and will take about 12 weeks to complete, subject to good weather. The start of work was delayed by the Environment Agency to allow the annual Todmorden Agricultural Show and the Tour de France to take place without any disruption. Environment Agency project manager Darren Gallagher said: Our investigations over the past few months have showed that most of the park’s drainage system is in good condition. We are confident that the work we will be undertaking to clear the blockages, in conjunction with regular maintenance by Calderdale Council, will cure the problems in Centre Vale Park. Mr Gallagher added that the contractors would try to ensure that any disruption caused by site work and by vehicle movements to and from the park would be kept to a minimum. Calderdale Council’s Safer, Cleaner, Greener Manager, Amanda Firth, said: We have been working with the Environment Agency to find a solution to the drainage problems in Centre Vale Park, and we are delighted that rectification work is about to start. We’re keen to make sure people can fully enjoy the great facilities in the park – now and for years to come. The work will be carried out between 8am and 5.30pm on weekdays. There will be no weekend working."
/government/news/new-fish-passes-open-in-leeds,"Helping fish populations of brown trout and coarse fish to move freely past two weirs New fish passes open in Leeds  Environment Agency Two new fish passes have been opened at Burley Mills Weir and St Ann’s Mills Weir on the River Aire alongside Commercial Road in Kirkstall, Leeds. The passes have been built by the Aire Rivers Trust in partnership with Leeds City Council and the Environment Agency. The Burley Mills Fish Pass, located in attractive surroundings, can be seen from the public viewing point at the weir. The £400,000 Kirkstall project was funded by Defra’s Catchment Restoration Fund which is administered by the Environment Agency. Leeds City Council will be taking ownership of the two fish passes. The fish passes will enable the current fish populations of brown trout and coarse fish to move freely past the weirs to find the best places to feed, shelter, spawn and grow. In the longer term the two fish passes will be a part of a chain which will allow salmon and sea trout to reach their historic spawning grounds upstream in Leeds, Bradford and the Craven District of North Yorkshire. The weirs at Kirkstall have been a barrier to upstream movement of fish for around 200 years and the fish passes will not only improve fish stocks but will also improve the general ecology of the river. Kevin Sunderland, Chairman of the Aire Rivers Trust, said that water quality improvements over the last 40 years have led to improved fish populations and this has meant that fish passes have become necessary to allow the river to reach its full potential. He also paid tribute to the help and co-operation which the Trust had received from various departments within Leeds Council and thanked the Environment Agency for providing the necessary funding and technical advice. Neil Trudgill, Fisheries Technical Specialist at the Environment Agency said: We are delighted to have worked with the Aire Rivers Trust on this project and congratulate the Trust on completing the project early and under budget. Angling is very popular in Leeds city centre and these passes will help improve our fish populations to benefit people and the environment. When fish are able to move freely up and down rivers, they are also less vulnerable to the occasional accidental pollution incidents that still occur in our rivers. The Aire Rivers Trust, a registered charity, was formed in 2011 with the specific intention of increasing the amenity value of the River Aire, particularly as regards recreation, fish populations and associated wildlife."
/government/news/flood-risk-work-to-start-in-leicester,"On Monday 22 September, the Environment Agency and Leicester City Council will start work to help reduce flood risk in Leicester. Flood risk work to start in Leicester  Environment Agency The work will take place on a section of the River Biam near the Great Central Way and will remove a build up of silt from the 2 southernmost arches of the Biam Bridge. This is part of the first phase of Leicester’s flood risk management scheme and is expected to last for 6 weeks. Work will involve lowering the ground level beneath the arches by about 1 metre, which will help reduce the risk of flooding to about 250 homes in Braunstone Town and Aylestone. The footpath from Braunstone Lane East under the Great Central Way bridge to the Great Central Way spur will be closed for 5 days between 22 September and 10 October during the works. The exact closure dates are weather dependent and will be signposted nearer the time. The Great Central Way footpath and cycle path will remain open as normal, and access to the route from the eastern side will also be unaffected. Great Central Way can also be accessed from Braunstone Lane East and Evesham Road as normal. Aylestone Meadows nature reserve and Riverside Park will not be affected. Further works along the River Soar corridor are planned for 2015. Leicester City Mayor Peter Soulsby said: “This is part of the ongoing work being carried out in the city to ensure our flood management is up to the challenges posed by climate change and demands of a modern-day city. “We’re currently consulting on a flood alleviation plan for the city, and investing in tackling some of the main problem areas. The work at the bridge will lessen flood risk across a wide area of the city.” Jon Vann, the Environment Agency’s lead on the project, added: “Together with partners in Leicester City Council, we’re developing a holistic approach to reducing flood risk for the local community, as well as delivering economic and environmental benefits. “We will do everything possible to minimise any disruption and will put the safety of the public at the heart of our project.” More information about the scheme is available on the Leicester flood risk management scheme webpage."
/government/news/jawless-fish-given-helping-hand-by-the-environment-agency,"Trial of new materials to help lamprey overcome weirs Jawless fish given helping hand by the Environment Agency  Environment Agency The Environment Agency is working in partnership with Durham University to find new ways to help river lamprey to migrate up rivers and access more spawning grounds. Researchers are testing new materials to see what will help the lamprey to easily use the existing fish pass at Buttercrambe weir, near Stamford Bridge. The first material to be used is a black plastic studded tile which is being attached to the fish pass this summer. A trial will be run to see how many lamprey will use the fish pass with the new material added. During the lamprey migration period between October and February researchers will catch and tag the lamprey before releasing them back into the River Derwent. The tags will allow automated monitoring equipment to be used at the fish pass and it is hoped that the new material will show improvements in numbers of lamprey using the pass compared to results from the previous year. Dr Martyn Lucas, of the School of Biological and Biomedical Sciences at Durham University said: Despite the name, river lamprey, they actually migrate down to the sea, like salmon, to feed there, but they must return to freshwater to reproduce. They are amongst the most ancient of our vertebrate (animals with a backbone) lineage, superficially they are eel-like but have no jaws, and have been around on Earth for hundreds of millions of years. Although they may look ugly to some people, they form a key part of the ecology of the rivers in which they occur – they are an important food for herons and sawbill ducks at nesting time and otters love them! Despite this they have been lost from many rivers across Europe, mostly because of habitat deterioration and migration barriers such as weirs. Rivers in the Humber catchment, including the Yorkshire Derwent, remain a stronghold for them. They can use their suckers to cling on to stones in swift water but are much poorer swimmers than salmon and trout, so have a job using conventional fish passes. We need to help them get past these barriers because most of their spawning habitat is upstream; currently most can only do so when the barriers are submerged during floods. We use a range of tracking methods from standard radio tag ‘bleepers’ to pet-type microchip ID tags to identify the migration routes and migration success of the lampreys – most of the ones we have tagged swim rapidly through unobstructed reaches and approach weirs and fish passes, but few get past. Pat O’Brien, Fisheries Technical Specialist at Environment Agency said: If the lamprey can move upstream in lower river flows they won’t use as much energy getting there and will be in a better condition when they reach the spawning grounds. At the moment only 2% of the available habitat in the River Derwent is used by the majority of the spawning lamprey. Many people never get to see a lamprey apart from during the spawning period. Following spawning, the lamprey dies so sometimes these are seen and reported to us. Anglers will not be able to catch these fish by rod and line because during the spawning freshwater phase, they do not feed. If anglers were able to catch the lamprey they might be shocked at the mouth parts attached to the end of their lines."
/government/news/safe-ark-for-threatened-norfolk-white-clawed-crayfish,"An endangered population of white-clawed crayfish have been released into the headwaters of a river in north Norfolk. Safe ark for threatened Norfolk white-clawed crayfish  Environment Agency On 17 September Environment Agency and partner organisation volunteers caught 300 white-clawed crayfish from a population at risk from the invasive non-native American signal crayfish. They released them to safety into the headwaters of the River Glaven. Signal crayfish carry a disease that kills white-clawed crayfish and has caused local extinctions. They also compete with white-clawed crayfish for food and burrows and may even eat the white-clawed crayfish. Amy Prendergast, Environmental Monitoring Officer for the Environment Agency said: It was great to see so many people getting hands on in catching and measuring the crayfish ready to be moved to their new home. We hope that they will thrive in the gravelly stream for many years to come. The signal crayfish and the new population of white-clawed crayfish will be separated by a number of sluices which act as a physical barrier that slows the upstream spread of crayfish. The signal crayfish in the lower river may take decades to reach this site, and in the meantime ongoing research will hopefully find a way of controlling signals in the future. Over the next five years the new site will be surveyed to check whether the new population of white-clawed crayfish are breeding and doing well. It is thought that the white-clawed crayfish were present in this location until the 1970s when they may have been wiped out by a pollution incident. This is part of a longer term project to help conserve the white-clawed crayfish, to populate ark sites through an annual co-ordinated day of action. Notes to editors: The partnership works to conserve white-clawed crayfish in Norfolk, Suffolk and Essex. Organisations involved included the Environment Agency, Norfolk Rivers Trust, Norfolk Biodiversity Partnership, Norfolk Non-Native Species Initiative, River Glaven Conservation Group, Norfolk Wildlife Trust and University College London. This is the fourth year of translocating crayfish at risk to safe Ark sites. The public can help to protect the white-clawed crayfish by following the Environment Agency’s advice to check, clean and dry. This will prevent the spread of non-native diseases, plants and animals. http://www.nonnativespecies.org/checkcleandry/ Sightings of crayfish can be sent to angeast.frb@environmnet-agency.gov.uk with a photograph.

Work begins on Boston flood bank  Environment Agency The flood defence was breached when high tides combined with a tidal surge on 5 December 2013 to produce the highest water levels ever recorded in the Haven, flooding the landfill site and commercial properties on Riverside Industrial Estate. Water was 6.08 above ordnance datum. Higher than the floods in 1953 and 1978. The Environment Agency did an initial repair to the damaged defence in December 2013 using sheet piles and 2,000 tonnes of stone to plug a 45 metre gap to reduce the risk of further flooding. Permanent repairs will now be carried out to the flood bank. The Environment Agency also plans to increase the width of the bank to 4 metres and the height to 7.3 metres above ordnance datum (the universal benchmark against which tides in Great Britain are measured). Work to the flood defence is being carried out in agreement with the landowner FCC Environment. Mark Robinson, Senior Coastal Advisor for the Environment Agency said: This project is good news for Boston and we remain committed to working in partnership to reduce the risk of tidal flooding in the town and the surrounding communities.

Opened in November 2013, the Medmerry flood defence project includes 4 miles of new sea walls to reduce flood risk for hundreds of local properties. The lifesaving defences held firm during last year’s floods and is seen as a gold standard of flood defence in the UK. The project was led by the Environment Agency. It created a new wetland for local wildlife with 183 hectares of intertidal habitat. Much of the site is now managed by the RSPB as a nature reserve. This new form of defence has helped to save £300,000 taxpayers’ money each year, the cost of repairing the shingle bank. It also supports local economic growth by allowing businesses to operate year round. View a short film about Medmerry. Haven for wildlife Dr Paul Leinster, Chief Executive of the Environment Agency said: This award recognises the excellent work of our dedicated staff and contractors in protecting people and property through delivering innovative and effective flood risk management schemes. The Medmerry managed realignment scheme protects 348 homes, important infrastructure that serves over 5,000 households and creates an intertidal habitat at the same time that will boost tourism in the area.

/government/news/illegal-manchester-waste-site-owner-sentenced,"The Environment Agency has successfully prosecuted a man for operating a large scale illegal landfill site in central Manchester. Illegal Manchester waste site owner sentenced  Environment Agency Princeston Valentino Green, 51, of Castle Road, Kidderminster appeared at Manchester Crown Court on Monday 8 September where he was sentenced to eight months in prison, suspended for two years. He was also fined £3000, ordered to undertake 200 hours community work and required to pay a £15 victim surcharge. Environment Officers conducted a covert surveillance operation in February 2011 after almost 12,000 cubic metres of waste built up at the site of the Old Lancashire Dairy Mill at Knowsley Street off Cheetham Hill Road, Manchester – enough waste to fill five Olympic swimming pools. The officers gathered photographic evidence of Green accepting and storing waste without a permit, and a subsequent search revealed a log book of vehicle movements and waste deposits at the site. Environmental Crime Officer Sharon Owen said: “This is a great result for the community and businesses in central Manchester. The waste being stored illegally by Green and others was an eyesore, posed huge health risks and blighted the local environment.” The court imposed the sentence using recently issued Sentencing Guidelines. Those committing serious waste crime face the prospect of significant penalties, including imprisonment. If you spot piles of waste building up in your community then report it to the Environment Agency on 0800 80 70 60. We can tell you if the site has a permit, and we will regulate permitted sites rigorously to make sure waste is stored safely."

/government/news/official-opening-of-fazeley-flood-risk-management-scheme,"The Environment Agency has officially opened the Fazeley section of the Lower Tame flood scheme.    Official opening of Fazeley flood risk management scheme  Environment Agency On 5 September 2014, the Environment Agency met with the local community, councillors and the construction team to officially open the Fazeley section of the Lower Tame flood scheme. This work has reduced the risk of flooding to 250 properties in the area. Construction of the £3.5million Fazeley section of the scheme began in June 2013 and was completed in August 2014. The works include new flood banks at Mayfair Drive as well as new flood walls along New Mill Lane, Coton Green Football Club, Brook End and parts of Coleshill Road. The work has also involved raising the existing flood bank on Brook End and the Environment Agency has worked with Staffordshire County Council to reduce surface water flooding on Brook End and Coleshill Road. The Fazeley section is one of the 4 sections that make up the Lower Tame flood risk management scheme. The others are in Coton, Kingsbury and Whitacre Heath, with a total scheme cost of £11million. There were over 2,000 residential properties at risk from flooding in these areas from the River Tame before works began. Beverley Brown, Project Manager said: “We’re pleased to officially open the second section of the flood risk management scheme today. There has been a huge amount of work done to get us to this point and I’d like to thank everyone who’s been involved with the project.” Christopher Pincher, MP for Tamworth, opened the flood scheme and said: “In 2007, many houses in Fazeley were flooded from the River Tame and the new flood defences will go a long way to ensure that doesn’t happen again.” For further information about the Lower Tame flood scheme visit Lower Tame flood risk management strategy .

/government/news/work-begins-on-westonzoyland-defence-scheme,"  The Environment Agency begins constructing the new flood defence works at Westonzoyland in Somerset this week.   Work begins on Westonzoyland defence scheme  Environment Agency The Agency has worked closely on the design with the local community over the past few months, particularly those residents most affected by flooding. After listening to their views, it has finalised the details of a new permanent defence to replace the temporary defence installed last winter. The access road will be built this week followed by construction of the new sheet piled wall, which will sit approximately 1 metre away from the existing garden boundaries. The top of the sheet piles will provide a functional flood defence while finishing works are completed. Chris Smith for the Environment Agency said: We plan to have a flood defence in place ahead of the winter. After this, we will install anchor piles and improve the visual appearance. Final detail of this will be shared with the residents nearer the time. It is unlikely we will complete all works and leave site before December. We apologise for any inconvenience caused during these works, and appreciate your understanding that the short term disruption experienced will be worth the long term benefit. During the building of the access road there will be a lot of vehicle movements behind the properties. This will involve transporting stone and compacting it. During the building of the piled wall, a piling rig will be set-up on the newly constructed access road. Chris Smith added: It is essential that no members of the public access the land behind the gardens during our works. This is a construction site, and it is not safe for the public to walk here while we are working. Our priority is to keep people safe. Ends"

Residents and businesses invited to Forge Mill Farm drop-in  Environment Agency The drop-in will be held on Tuesday 2 December 2014 from 10am to 4pm at Forge Mill Farm Shop, Forge Lane, West Bromwich, B71 3SZ. Environment Agency staff will be on hand to provide information about the proposals for the scheme. The proposals include an increase in storage capacity at the existing Forge Mill flood storage area in Sandwell Valley. This will work in combination with localised low level wall construction and wall replacement through Witton. This is a change from the original recommendations within the Tame Strategy for the construction of 3m high walls through Witton. The Environment Agency suggested changes after discovering ground conditions in the area are not suitable for construction, which would also result in an increase in cost to the scheme. The design is at an early stage and the Environment Agency is currently discussing the impacts at Forge Mill with landowners and stakeholders. The drop-in session will offer an opportunity for the local community to comment on the proposals at Forge Mill and how the works may affect residents. Rachel Kelly, Environment Agency Project Manager, commented: We’d like residents and businesses to come along and talk to us about proposals for the flood storage scheme. Like all major rivers, the River Tame has a history of flooding. In June and July 2007, there was widespread flooding to areas along the River Tame – including areas of Perry Barr and Witton. Our proposed designs will offer a reduction in flood risk to hundreds of properties along a 14km stretch of river, including the communities of Perry Barr and Witton. Our new design also offers excellent potential to deliver environmental improvements in the Sandwell Valley area at Forge Mill. This is a chance for local people to let us know what they think about the proposed designs and let us know any concerns they may have.

This first ever long-term investment programme will protect over 300,000 properties, reduce flood risk by 5% and save the economy £2.7 billion by 2021. The lifetime benefits of this investment will be even higher at over £30 billion. With 1,400 projects within the programme, local authorities will be able to plan ahead and reassure communities that flood risk is being reduced in their area. New schemes may also be added as the programme progresses Major projects that will benefit include: £80 million for the Humber Estuary £17 million for Tonbridge, Yalding and the surrounding communities £196 million for the Thames Estuary programme £73 million for the Boston Barrier/Barrage £42 million for the Oxford Western Conveyance £47 million for the Rossall Coastal Defence Improvement In addition, the government has committed to spend £15.5 million in Somerset on flood defences over the next 6 years, benefiting 7,000 properties. This includes £4.2 million on the Somerset Levels and Moors. This is part of at least £35 million committed to Somerset from this year until 2021. Environment Agency Chairman Sir Philip Dilley said: Our priority is to do as much as we can with every pound of funding from government and local partners, we now expect to provide better flood protection to an additional 300,000 properties in England by the end of the decade. With one in six homes in England at risk of flooding, and recognising the risk of flooding can never be eliminated, we would also encourage people to take their own steps to prepare for flooding, for example by signing up to the Environment Agency’s free flood warning service. The lifetime benefits of this investment will be more than £30bn. New schemes may also be added as the programme progresses. The investment programme was published alongside a new long term study from the Environment Agency, which shows that the planned investment will reduce overall flood and coastal erosion risk in England.

/guidance/fertiliser-recommendations-for-crops,"Crop fertiliser recommendations from the Defra Fertiliser Manual RB209, including choosing, applying and managing fertilisers and manures.  Fertiliser recommendations for crops Land management Environment Agency Introduction Fertiliser planning is central to nutrient management, which is central to the yield and quality of crops from your land and is part of cross compliance for farms in Nitrate Vulnerable Zones ( NVZs ). The Fertiliser Manual (RB209) is published by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs ( Defra ) and sets out fertiliser recommendations for agricultural and horticultural crops. This guide explains RB209 recommendations about the most cost-effective use of lime, major nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, sulphur, magnesium, sodium) and trace elements. It also provides information about choosing and applying fertiliser and organic manures, using the RB209 recommendation tables, and suggests organisations that can advise you on fertilisers and nutrient management. Nutrient management Nutrient management with the help of the Defra Fertiliser Manual (RB209) - will help you: assess the fertiliser you need for the range of crops you plan to grow understand which level of nutrients is required to provide the best financial return for your farm business take proper account of both mineral fertilisers and other sources of nutrients such as manures and slurries to avoid costly over-application comply with the cross compliance requirements to protect your land and the environment including watercourses As crops obtain nutrients from several sources, it is essential to carry out integrated plant nutrient management of all the sources from which crops obtain these nutrients, including: mineralisation of soil organic matter (all nutrients) deposition from the atmosphere (mainly nitrogen and sulphur) weathering of soil minerals (especially potash) biological nitrogen fixation (legumes) application of organic manures - including non-livestock sources (all nutrients) application of manufactured fertilisers (all nutrients) other materials added to land - eg soil conditioners For optimum nutrient management, the total supply of a nutrient from all the above sources must meet, but not exceed, crop requirement. For more information on nutrient management and cross compliance, see the guides on managing nutrients and fertilisers and the basics of cross compliance . Environmental Stewardship ( ES ) If you complete a Nutrient Management Plan - Option EM2 of ES agreements - you can gain points towards your ES agreement. For more information, see the guide on ES : the basics or download the Tried and Tested Nutrient Management Plan from the Agricultural Document Library (ADLib) website (PDF, 1.57MB) . Fertiliser Recommendations for Agricultural and Horticultural Crops (RB209) and the Fertiliser Manual The Fertiliser Recommendations for Agricultural and Horticultural Crops - RB209 - provide information about the most cost-effective use of lime and major nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, sulphur, magnesium, sodium), as well as nutrients from organic manures. It also advises on nutrient management and protecting the environment from diffuse nutrient pollution. The Fertiliser Recommendations were published in 2000 by Defra and are due to be replaced in autumn 2009 by the Fertiliser Manual. Until the 2009 Fertiliser Manual becomes available, you should use technical updates or get information from a current Fertiliser Advisers Certification and Training Scheme ( FACTS ) qualified adviser when you use the 2000 edition of RB209. You can  find out about the Fertiliser Manual (RB209) on the Defra website . The software for Planning Land Applications of Nutrients for Efficiency and the Environment ( PLANET ) is the free, interactive, computerised version of RB209. Farmers and advisers can get a free download of PLANET software, or a free copy of the PLANET CD - find PLANET software, documents, patches and updates on the PLANET website . PLANET is also incorporated in several commercial software packages for farmers. Find out about PLANET on the PLANET website . Planning applications of lime and nitrogen A deficiency in essential plant nutrients and trace elements can restrict crop growth. An excess can cause crop growth problems and risks environmental pollution. Maintaining a balance between nutrients is also important, because they can interact with each other and too much of one can stop others from working. The Fertiliser Manual (RB209) advises on how to plan applications of lime and nitrogen based on the properties of your soil. Understanding soil physical properties In each field you will need to know the soil texture, organic matter content, potential rooting depth, soil stone content and soil parent material - each of these affect how fertilisers act on crops. For information on identifying your soil type, see our guide on managing soil types . Soil acidity and liming Soil pH affects the amount of lime to use on your fields. The range of optimum soil pH varies for different crops and soil types. The recommended amount of lime also depends on soil texture and organic matter. RB209 describes the available range of liming materials, and when to apply them. Planning the use of nitrogen fertiliser for field crops Before applying nitrogen fertiliser, you need to take account of the nitrogen supply and loss process which determines the amount of nitrogen in your soil. You can do this by assessing the: Soil Nitrogen Supply ( SNS ) in each of your fields every year, using an SNS index value from zero to six mineral nitrogen residues after harvest, but before leaching nitrogen leaching losses using excess winter rainfall nitrogen released from mineralisation of organic matter To work out the SNS Index of your soils, you can use the Field Assessment Method, or the Soil Mineral Nitrogen ( SMN ) Analysis Method. SMN analysis is recommended if you expect high or uncertain amounts of soil nitrogen. For field assessment of SNS , you need information about the soil type, previous cropping, previous manure and fertiliser use and winter rainfall. After calculating the SNS , there are three more calculations to make in planning nitrogen fertiliser use: the crop nitrogen requirement - the optimum amount of nitrogen to apply to a crop, taking into account the SNS the crop nitrogen available from any planned applications of organic manure the amount of manufactured nitrogen fertiliser you need to apply Crops take up different sources of nitrogen with varying degrees of efficiency. Almost 100 per cent of SMN within rooting depth is taken up by the crop. Winter wheat and winter barley uptake of fertiliser nitrogen is less efficient, and varies with soil type. RB209 recommendations for fertiliser use take account of these differences in efficiency of uptake. You can find out more about planning your use of nitrogen fertiliser in the guide on managing nutrients and fertilisers . You should time applications of nitrogen to coincide with the start of rapid crop growth and nitrogen uptake. Generally, nitrogen is best applied across the whole cropped area. But for wide-row crops, band placement of nitrogen improves crop performance and reduces fertiliser costs and the risk of nitrate pollution of water. Planning applications of essential nutrients The Fertiliser Manual (RB209) advises on planning the application of essential nutrients to your soil. Planning the nutrient quantity carefully enables you use nutrients in a cost effective way that provides the best crop yields and minimises risks of environmental pollution. Phosphorus and potassium Phosphorus and potassium are available in soil reserves, fertilisers or organic manures. Different types of manures have different amounts of phosphorus and potassium. Excessive levels of phosphorus in soil are financially wasteful and likely to cause pollution of surface waters, leading to eutrophication. This causes algal blooms and can destroy aquatic life. In order to plan your use of phosphate and potash fertilisers you need to know: soil indices for phosphorus and potassium, from soil sampling and lab analysis - to be done every four years target soil indices for phosphorus and potassium for the crop phosphorus and potassium application policies whether you need to build up or run down the soil phosphorus or potassium index You can  find out about the Fertiliser Manual (RB209) on the Defra website . Magnesium Soil analysis will show the quantity of available magnesium in soil, expressed as an index. Magnesium deficiency will cause potatoes and sugar beet to show deficiency symptoms and their yield may improve when magnesium fertiliser is applied. Sulphur In the past, sulphur was supplied to plants through rainfall and fertilisers that contain sulphur as a by-product. But sulphur in rainfall is declining, bringing a risk of sulphur deficiency in crops including cereals, brassicas, peas, oilseed rape and grass. Crop symptoms of sulphur deficiency are hard to tell apart from nitrogen deficiency. To assess the risk of sulphur deficiency you will need: knowledge of soil type and field location a leaf analysis of cereals, oilseed rape and grass a soil analysis of sulphur levels Sodium Crops such as sugar beet and carrots need sodium. Soil sampling and lab analysis will identify if you need to apply sodium fertilisers. Trace elements or micronutrients Most micronutrients or trace elements are naturally adequate in soils in England - only manganese is commonly deficient. This affects mostly sugar beet, cereals and peas grown on acidic peaty, organic and sandy soils. Symptoms of manganese deficiency in crops are similar to those created by other crop growth problems, so you will need to use plant/soil analysis to confirm a trace element deficiency. Other trace element deficiencies that affect crop growth: boron - can affect sugar beet and brassica crops on light soils with a pH above 6.5 copper - can affect cereals and sugar beet on certain soil types iron - affects fruit crops grown on chalky soils Deficiencies affecting livestock Deficiencies of cobalt, copper and selenium in grazing animals will not affect grass growth - it’s best to treat the animals directly with the missing trace element, rather than applying them to the grass. Choosing and applying fertiliser There are many types and qualities of fertiliser in both solid and liquid forms. Before deciding which to buy, you need to consider: the total concentration and ratio of nutrients in the fertiliser - the concentration will affect the amount you apply and the ratio should be close to your planned nutrient needs the chemical form of each nutrient - different chemical forms of a nutrient may be taken up by crops more or less effectively the physical quality of a solid fertiliser and whether you will be able to spread it accurately - different sources of supply of the same fertiliser type can be physically quite different and some will be easier to apply accurately than others the cost of the nutrients - this can vary significantly, and cheaper fertilisers may be poorer quality and so a false economy Nitrogen fertilisers include ammonium nitrate, ammonium sulphate and calcium ammonium nitrate. Water-soluble phosphate fertilisers are quickly taken up by crops. Water-insoluble phosphate fertilisers come in different concentrations and types and you will need to assess them for suitability. Nutrients in most sources of potash fertiliser are quickly available to crops. Magnesium fertilisers vary in how quickly or slowly crops can take up their nutrients. Fertiliser application Accurate and even fertiliser application will maximise crop yields and profitability. Inaccurate, uneven application can cause problems such as: uneven crops, lodging and disease, and reduced yields and quality at harvest nutrient pollution of watercourses at field margins changes to biodiversity in hedgerows and field margins You need to regularly maintain and service fertiliser spreaders and sprayers. Protecting the environment from diffuse nutrient pollution To avoid polluting watercourses and groundwater, make sure that you don’t apply more fertiliser than the crops require and that you apply fertiliser close to the time when the plants will take it up. This will minimise leaching of nutrients. Ammonia emissions from livestock manures and nitrogen fertilisers contribute to acid rain and damage nitrogen-poor habitats such as heathland. To find out how to reduce ammonia emissions see the guide on sewage sludge, slurry and silage . To avoid eutrophication caused by phosphorus pollution of watercourses: plan phosphorus applications carefully avoid surface application of organic manures when soil and weather conditions are likely to lead to run off apply small annual dressings of fertiliser, which you work into the soil surface before winter Organic manures You can produce organic manures on your farm from slurries, farmyard manures and poultry manures, or you can buy treated sewage sludges (biosolids) and some industrial wastes. You can find out more about organic manures in the guide on sewage sludge, slurry and silage . You can find further detail in Section 2 of The Fertiliser Manual (RB209). You can  download Defra ’s RB209 from the Agricultural Document Library (ADLib) website (PDF, 4.47MB) . Farm animal manures and slurries You can find out how to prepare an organic manure sheet using the Tried and Tested Nutrient Management Plan. You can  download the Tried & Tested Nutrient Management Plan from the ADLib website. (PDF, 1.57MB) . Good practice in applying manure includes: minimising nitrate-leaching losses by applying in spring band spreading to allow accurate slurry topdressing and reduce ammonia emissions - rear discharge spreaders spread slurry and manure more evenly than side dischargers applying cattle slurry in spring to grasslands where you intend to produce silage or hay not grazing pasture for four weeks after you have applied slurry or solid manure, or until all visible signs have disappeared sampling the soil periodically to test for heavy metals, if you apply pig or poultry manures to the same land over several years Nitrate Vulnerable Zones and nitrate pollution Nitrate pollution is a particular problem for over 60 per cent of agricultural land in England. In England, nitrate regulations implement the European Community’s Nitrates Directive, with the aim of reducing nitrogen losses from agriculture to water. In areas where nitrate pollution is a problem, you must follow practices set out in the Defra guidance. These also form cross compliance Statutory Management Requirement 4 which must be followed in order to receive direct farm payments. For more information, see the guide on  NVZs . Manure Nitrogen Evaluation Routine ( MANNER ) MANNER is a free, decision-support software system that you can use to predict the precise fertiliser nitrogen value of organic manures on a field-specific basis. In this way, you can avoid applying too much or too little nitrate, either of which could adversely affect crop yields and quality. Find out how to use MANNER on the ADAS website . Apply for a free copy of the MANNER software on the ADAS website . Sewage sludges (biosolids) For information on using sewage sludge on your farm, see the guide on sewage sludge, slurry and silage . Find out about cross compliance Statutory Management Requirement 3 - Sewage in the guide on managing nutrients and fertilisers (includes tool) . Safe sludges to apply to your land include digested cake and liquid sludges. You can also use lime-stabilised, thermally-dried and composted sludges. These are supplied by water companies and come with nutrient-content data and other information. Nitrogen supply from sludges is affected by the same factors that affect supply and losses of nitrogen from farm manures. Industrial wastes You can spread some industrial wastes onto your farm land.

After all, the crop is the best thing to tell you how you are doing.” “Keep robust records. It’s important to know how much fertiliser you put on each crop to understand the economics of it.” “Don’t let technology take your eye off the ball and make you forget the basics such as agronomy and calibration.” Andrew Cragg has been farming Brooker Farm in Romney Marsh, Kent since 1980. He grows winter wheat, rape and vining peas over 600 hectares and employs three people. Here he explains how fertilisers are maintaining his yields. What I did Use precision soil-sampling techniques to map my requirements “I look not only at each of my fields in turn, but also within the fields in order to understand the phosphorous and potassium variations in the soil. Using the Global Positioning System ( GPS ) is essential for this because it tells me where I am in the field. Having a map of my soil showing how the nutrients vary between and within the fields means I apply nutrients only where they are required. It also means I even out my yields on these areas and I minimise the environmental impact of blanket applications. “I don’t nutrient map everywhere because it wouldn’t be cost effective, but I do it where I suspect I have levels of variation. I also do pH mapping using the same principle - putting lime on only where I really need it.” Keep an eye on micronutrients Sometimes I do foliar testing. I take a sample of the crop in the spring and send it away so they assess the presence of micronutrients in the crop itself. I only do it if I suspect a serious problem though. “Last year I did it with the oilseed rape and it showed it was a little low on some key micronutrients so I used a foliar-applied nutrient mix. It’s difficult to know whether it was effective or not but you have to go with your intuition. To not take action is to take a risk.” Choose a product with care “I choose a fertiliser that is good quality for the method by which I spread it. I spread with a twin-disc spreader so I buy a product with a good granule size. “My other consideration is the strength of the product. I favour 46 per cent urea because you get more of it in a tank than 34.5 per cent ammonium nitrate, and it goes further. I also go for straights rather than mixes. Because of my soil type I rarely need potassium so straights are more cost effective. In short, it’s about quality, strength and value.” What I’d do differently Invest in the right tools at the start “I’ve bought a variable bout-width controller for my spreader. This uses GPS to tell the spreader where it is in the field and it reduces the width of the spread as it approaches an angled headland at the field boundary to reduce overlapping. It has a clear economic and environmental benefit. I wish this had been available earlier.” Further information Potash Development Association Helpline 01904 492 009 Environment Agency Helpline 03708 506 506 MANNER Technical Support 01623 844 331 PLANET Helpline 08456 023 864 MANNER Software Ordering Helpline 0845 605 3864 Natural England Enquiry Service 0845 600 3078 BASIS (Registration) Limited Enquiry Line 01335 343 945 RPA Customer Service Centre 0345 603 7777 Defra Helpline 03459 33 55 77 Cross Compliance Helpline 0345 345 1302 Download the Tried and Tested Nutrient Management Plan from the ADLib website (PDF, 1.57MB) Download Defra ’s RB209 from the ADLib website (PDF, 4.47MB) FACTS information on the FACTS website FACTS -qualified advisers listed on the BASIS website The Fertiliser Manual (RB209) on the Defra website Code of Good Agricultural Practice on protecting water, soil and air on the Defra website PLANET software, documents, patches and updates on the Planet4farmers website"

/government/news/morpeth-town-centre-flood-protection-scheme-finished,"Homes and businesses now better protected Morpeth town centre flood protection scheme finished  Environment Agency This winter, Morpeth homes and business are better protected than ever from the threat of flooding from the River Wansbeck. Construction of new flood defences in Morpeth town centre, as part of the multi-million pound flood alleviation scheme, is now complete. Since early 2013, contractors working on behalf of the Environment Agency and Northumberland County Council have been constructing new defences in the town and improving the existing ones. This has included work at High Stanners to build a new flood wall and embankment along the riverside area to tie in with Oldgate Bridge at one end, and Skinnery Bridge at the other. Until the £27 million flood alleviation scheme began, residents of High Stanners had no protection against flooding. The new flood wall and 3 new flood gates that make up the flood defence is complete and water tight, and reduces the risk of flooding to homes and businesses in the lowest lying area of the town. Other areas of the town with a reduced threat of flooding this winter are Crawford Terrace and Middle Greens, the areas around St George’s Church and St Robert’s Church, Pretoria Avenue and Mitford Road. Flood protection for the whole town will be further improved when the upstream flood water storage is finished. This is expected to be in early 2015. The upstream dam on the Mitford Estate, which is in its final stages of completion, will work by storing up to 1.4 million cubic metres of water when river levels on the Wansbeck are high and could cause flooding. Environment Agency Project Manager, Anthony Myatt, said: Ahead of this Christmas we hope the community is reassured that all the work we have done so far has reduced their risk of flooding. Work to complete the new storage area will continue until the end of February when the whole flood scheme is expected to be in place, weather permitting. Work is also due to take place next year to reduce the risk of flooding from the Cotting Burn. Although a number of improvements to the in-town defences around the burn have been made since 2008, there is now planning permission in place to create an upstream storage area on the Cotting Burn."
/government/news/regional-flood-and-coastal-committee-support-flood-alleviation,"Over £20 million of public investment has been pledged to reduce flood risk across the English Severn and Wye catchment over the next 6 years. Regional Flood and Coastal Committee support flood alleviation  Environment Agency Yesterday (Tuesday 13 January 2015), members of the Environment Agency’s English Severn and Wye Regional Flood and Coastal Committee (RFCC) pledged approximately £6 million over the next 6 years towards flood alleviation works across the catchment. The Local Levy funds pledged by the RFCC members will support national Grant in Aid funds that were announced by the Government in December 2014. This local investment has helped provisionally secure a further £15 million of national funding over the next 6 years. This will allow schemes to progress across the English Severn and Wye catchment, including: a £1.2 million flood alleviation scheme in Much Wenlock which will involve creating flood storage to reduce the risk of flooding to 142 properties the £3 million Badsey Brook Flood Alleviation Scheme will reduce the risk of flooding to approximately 290 properties along Badsey and Bunches Brook in Broadway, Childswickham and Murcot the £1.6 million surface water flood alleviation scheme to reduce flood risk to up to 159 properties in Whaddon, Cheltenham the £300,000 Bedworth Flood Alleviation scheme, which reduces the risk of flooding to 40 properties in the Delamere Road area of Bedworth The investment will also fund a range of other flood alleviation schemes, such as upstream storage areas, improving existing and constructing new defences, tackling surface water flooding, and providing individual property level protection. There are also projects within the 6 year plan to work with communities who are at risk from rapid responding rivers, as well as undertaking schemes involving natural solutions to slow down the amount of flow entering the rivers. The benefits of this investment over the next 6 years will reduce flood risk to over 2,900 residential properties and will prevent over £150 million in damages to businesses, infrastructure and properties over the lifetime of the defences. English Severn and Wye Regional Flood and Coastal Committee Chair Anne Wheeler said: “The local levy funds help to finance schemes which protect smaller communities that would not otherwise be eligible for full funding, as well as enabling GiA to be spent more widely across the Severn and Wye catchment. We are grateful for the commitment of all our lead local flood authority partners, which helps ensure that residents at threat from flooding will now benefit from increased protection.” Anthony Perry, Environment Agency Area Flood Risk Manager said: “We are really pleased that this funding has been made available for capital projects and to assist communities with property protection schemes. This money will go a long way in making communities more resilient, and protecting them from the effects of flooding which we know can be devastating.” Notes to editors More information about the committee can be found on the English Severn and Wye Regional Flood and Coastal Committee web pages. Local Levy funding Local councils raise Local Levy to fund works in partnership with others and local priority projects that do not qualify for central government funding. Grant in Aid funding In December, central government (Defra) announced a 6 year programme of funding known as capital Flood Defence Grant-in-Aid (FDGiA).

/government/news/smelly-site-drove-people-indoors,"Waste operator Alan Teesdale has been sentenced to 9 months imprisonment suspended for 2 years for running an illegal site. Smelly site drove people indoors  Environment Agency He used land at Great Fen Road in Boston, Lincolnshire which was not suitable and the judge told him that he was not properly prepared either, despite repeated advice from the Environment Agency. Judge Stuart Rafferty sitting at Lincoln Crown Court also ordered him on Friday (9 Jan) to pay a contribution to the prosecution costs of £2,500. Teesdale registered three exemptions with the Environment Agency to store, clean and treat waste plastics and cardboard at the site but in April 2013 complaints were made about smells and an investigation began. The court was told that some people living nearby described the smells as ‘pungent like rotting meat’ and were forced to close their doors and windows and stay indoors. One man had to abandon his gardening as the smell gave him a headache and he was sick. Plastic containers with food remains and liquids were found being stored outside and the smell was so strong it went beyond the boundary of the site. Mrs Anne-Lise McDonald, prosecuting for the Environment Agency, told the court that the site drained into the South Forty Foot Drain and Teesdale had been sent warning letters for polluting the river in 2011, and a field ditch in 2012. In April 2013 he was told that the site did not comply with the exemptions he had registered, because he was causing odour pollution, rats and flies. A month later there was more waste on site. An officer saw waste being washed close to a surface water drain and Teesdale was told to stop and to clear waste from around the drain as there was no sealed drainage in breach of one of the exemptions. Mrs McDonald told the court that despite the warnings, during June and July liquid was allowed to leak onto the ground and water in the surface water drains was milky grey. Teesdale was asked to produce an action plan showing how he proposed to comply with his exemptions but nothing changed and the relevant exemption was de-registered. He was told to remove all the waste from the land by 1 August. It was still there on 2 August and there were tanks full of washwater, fat and foods on site. He told investigators that he had operated from the site for 3 years but had not realized what he was getting into. He had taken more waste than could be managed. In mitigation, Andrew Vout, said Teesdale had simply got in over his head. He said Teesdale should have turned waste away. He said he had since cleared the site. Judge Rafferty said the waste activity was clearly beyond Teesdale’s ability and he allowed it to go on causing horrendous odours, rats and flies. He gave him credit for clearing the site and his early guilty plea. He said he would like to fine him the costs he avoided from his illegal operations but said Teesdale had insufficient finance. After the hearing Environment Agency officer Emma Ayers said: Unregulated waste sites can cause harm to the environment and people. Neighbours of this site were subjected to horrible smells for 4 months and the river was at serious risk of pollution. Teesdale pleaded guilty to: Between 15 April 2013 and 18 February 2014 on land at Great Fen Road, Boston, Lincolnshire, PE21 7PB you operated a regulated facility, namely a waste operation for the deposit, storage and treatment of waste, without being authorised by an environmental permit granted under Regulation 13 of the Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2010. Contrary to Regulations 12(1)(a) and 38(1)(a) Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2010."
/government/news/exercise-to-test-hylton-road-flood-scheme,"On Sunday 8 February (was 22 January), an exercise is planned to test operational procedures at the Hylton Road flood defence scheme in Worcester city centre. Exercise to test Hylton Road flood scheme  Environment Agency The exercise will be carried out by the Environment Agency, Severn Trent Water and Worcestershire County Council and will allow each organisation to collectively test the responsibilities that they have during a flood, such as surface water pumping arrangements and flood barrier deployment. The Environment Agency will also be carrying out essential maintenance to parts of the demountable flood barriers which are in the highway. This will mean that there will be some disruption caused during the exercise as Hylton Road will be closed to traffic between 10am to 2pm. The path by the river will remain open to pedestrians. Richard Bentley from the Environment Agency said: “Exercises like this are essential for us to be able to test our multi-agency procedures and ensure effective operational response, so that we are all fully prepared for when flooding does occur. We are also using the closure of Hylton Road as an opportunity to carry out essential maintenance on our flood barriers across the highway, reducing future impacts to the businesses and residents.” Don Elt, Severn Trent Water service delivery manager for Worcestershire added: “We’ve recently increased the size of our pipework in Hylton Road so that we can use new, bigger pumps to move floodwater back into the river. This exercise is the perfect opportunity to make sure everything is working as it should and in conjunction with the actions of both the Environment Agency and the council. We’d like to apologise for any disruption, but making sure everything is ready now will help enormously the next time the river floods.” Worcestershire County Councillor John Smith, Cabinet Member for Highways, said: “We know that this closure may cause inconvenience, but it is being conducted outside of most business operating hours. It involves essential maintenance work and on-site testing to ensure we are prepared for any eventuality.”"

Sutton Harbour lock gates to undergo £250,000 upgrade  Environment Agency The repairs will begin during a first phase of work from Monday 2 March until Saturday 7 March, when the harbour will only be able to be accessed during the published free flow periods, and there will be no locking operations. The pedestrian footbridge is not expected to be affected during this period. The second phase of work will result in a short-term closure of the lock gates between 7am and 7pm from Monday 9 March until Saturday 14 March, and boats will be asked to enter or leave the harbour outside of this period. The pedestrian swing bridge over the lock gates will close temporarily between 7am and 7pm on Tuesday, March 10 and Wednesday, March 11 as a result of the crane operations necessary. The package of upgrade works is being funded by the Environment Agency, which has joint maintenance responsibility for the bridge and lock gates with harbour owner and operator Sutton Harbour Holdings plc. The £250,000 investment aims to ensure Plymouth’s harbour flood defence system remains manageable in the future, as well as securing safe, reliable lock operations at the busy harbour for years to come. Dave Turner for the Environment Agency said: Considerable works are being carried out at Sutton Harbour lock but it will not be hugely disruptive to people using the harbour as the repairs have been carefully planned. The Environment Agency is investing money in replacing obsolete equipment operating the lock gates to prevent any future deterioration, and to ensure the system remains fit for purpose, operating efficiently as well as and needing less regular maintenance in the future. Preparatory work starts in Sutton Harbour from Monday 2 March and the main work barge from which the repairs will be made is expected to arrive on Monday 9 March, with core works beginning on March 10. Pete Bromley, Harbour Master of Sutton Harbour, said: The barge will be positioned in the lock barrel to enable the replacement hydraulic cylinders to be lifted into place as the main upgrades to the lock gates are carried out. We have scheduled the second phase of the work to be carried out during free flow from 7am to 7pm daily between March 9 and March 14 to minimise disruption to anyone using the harbour, and ensure the repairs are completed quickly. All forms of vessels will be informed that they should enter or leave the harbour either side of these times. Some noise is expected during the day owing to the nature of the work but Sutton Harbour Holdings plc and the Environment Agency have worked closely together to ensure this essential programme of works is carried out as efficiently as possible, and completed quickly with minimal disruption.

/government/news/girton-flood-risk-reduced-by-relocation-of-service-pipes,"Work to reduce flood risk to properties in Girton, Cambridgeshire has been completed.   Girton flood risk reduced by relocation of service pipes  Environment Agency The Environment Agency led project involved the relocation of 10 service pipes, which carry everything from electricity and gas to cable TV and water, beneath the Beck Brook. The pipes previously spanned the Oakington Road Bridge crossing the Beck Brook. Agency investigations in 2012 suggested that during heavy rainfall the pipes could prevent the increased volumes of water from flowing downstream and away from the village, raising the water levels in the Beck Brook and on occasion causing flooding from the brook. Together with Cambridgeshire County Council and Cambridgeshire County Council Highways department it worked closely with Cambridge Water, UK Power Networks, National Grid, BT Openreach, Virgin Media and Anglian Water to identify the owner of each pipe and gain agreement to move the pipes underground. Contractor J N Bentley Ltd constructed new ducts to carry the services beneath the Beck Brook and to remove the redundant pipes after the service owners had relocated them to the new ducts. Georgina Nichols, Flood Risk Advisor at the Agency, said: This project is a great success for the local community who were keen to see the pipes moved. It would not have been possible without the co-operation of so many organisations. It’s taken time to get here, but the project is a fantastic demonstration of what a partnership approach can achieve for a community. Protecting people and property from flooding is a key role for the Environment Agency and whilst the relocation of these pipes will reduce flood risk in Girton there is still work we can do here. We will continue to investigate and progress other solutions to further manage flood risk in this community.” Councilor De Lacey, Girton Parish Council, said: Girton Parish Council has been concerned for a very long time at the effect the service pipes have on the flow when Beck Brook is in flood, and we are delighted to have been able to work with the Environment Agency and the service providers in having the services re-routed and the pipes removed. Although the bridge itself remains a cause of concern this is a significant step in Girton’s flood defences which will be welcomed by the whole village. One in 6 homes in England and Wales is at risk of flooding, and the Environment Agency is promoting the importance of preparing a flood plan for homes and businesses.

/government/news/formal-caution-given-to-commercial-fishermen-in-kent,"The Environment Agency has cautioned two commercial fishermen for illegally retaining sea trout. Formal caution given to commercial fishermen in Kent Fisheries and rod licensing Environment Agency Two Kent based commercial fishermen have been given formal cautions by the Environment Agency after illegally retaining sea trout aboard their boat. The offence was spotted off the Kent coast by enforcement officers from the Marine Management Organisation, who reported the fishermen to the Environment Agency for further investigation. Fisheries Officers from the Environment Agency then found that the fishermen had caught the sea trout using gill nets and had retained the fish illegally, which is in contravention of Section 27 of the Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries Act 1975. Sea trout are under threat from not only illegal netting, but also from pollution, habitat degradation, and impassable weirs in some rivers. Each large female fish can potentially lay thousands of eggs, so the loss of just one or two fish from localised breeding populations can have a significant impact. Environment Agency Fisheries Officer Joe Northgarden said: We work closely with partner organisations such as the Marine Management Organisation to proactively patrol vulnerable locations and ensure compliance with fisheries legislation and byelaws. Members of the public are encouraged to report any suspicious sea trout related activities to the Environment Agency’s 24 hour incident hotline on 0800 807060.

Visitors will also be given tips on how to prepare for floods and information about the flood warning service in Saffron Walden. Hibernating bats Liz Taylor, Flood Risk Advisor for the Environment Agency said: Reducing the risk of flooding to people and property is a key role for the Environment Agency. We began an initial CCTV survey of the Town Centre culvert, which runs directly underneath properties in Saffron Walden, ahead of our work to clear debris and carry out a detailed asset inspection. The survey found bats hibernating in the culvert which meant putting our work on hold until they have left. All bat species and their breeding or resting places (roosts) are protected by law. We will be carrying out a check at the end of March and hope to continue the work on the culvert once we are sure they are no longer hibernating. Despite this delay, we would particularly like to speak to those residents directly affected by our work and provide information to other riparian landowners about their roles and responsibilities for maintaining watercourses on or adjacent to their land. Riparian owners Riparian landowners have primary responsibility for making sure that the banks of their watercourse are solid, that banks and structures in the water are clear of obstructions which could cause flooding, that the bed, banks, trees and shrubs are maintained and that any litter or debris is removed. Riparian landowners should ensure that the water is free flowing.

Thames Water fined £220,000 for river pollution in Surrey  Environment Agency In a case brought by the Environment Agency, Thames Water Utilities Limited (Thames Water) were fined £220,000 and ordered to pay costs of £27,500 at Guildford Crown Court on 16 February for polluting the River Blackwater, a tributary of the River Loddon in Surrey. Thames Water was found guilty of breaching its environmental permit by allowing partially treated sewage and an illegal storm discharge to enter the River Blackwater. The pollution killed a significant number of fish, including Roach, Gudgeon, Minnow, Perch, Dace and Chub. The river flows through a SSSI (Site of Special Scientific Interest). The case was first heard on 16 September 2014 in Redhill Magistrate Court. Given the serious nature of the offences, the case was committed to Guildford Crown for sentencing where higher penalties could be imposed. The court heard Thames Water plead guilty to breaching their environmental permit and causing pollution to an environmentally sensitive site on 7 September and 30 September 2012, when illegal discharges of polluting effluent occurred from their sewage treatment works (STW) located on Doman Road in Camberley. The Environment Agency received reports of dead fish at Shepherd Meadows Nature Reserve at midday on 7 September 2012. Environment Agency officers responded quickly and observed distressed, gasping and dead fish in the river margins from Blackwater train station to Shepherds Meadow, nearly 2 kilometres downstream of the STW. The problem at the STW led to partially treated effluent being discharged into the river, which had the effect of suffocating fish in its path by depriving them of oxygen over a distance of approximately 1.5 kilometres. At court, Thames Water blamed its contractors for causing it to commit the offence. Judge Lucas QC did not accept this mitigation. The Judge concluded that the company had been reckless in relation to the incident and that significant environmental harm had been caused by the incident. Andrew Valantine, Senior Environment Agency officer said: Unfortunately this was a serious incident which led to fish being killed and the water quality being badly affected over a significant stretch of the river. Our team responded immediately by using aeration units to quickly pump much needed oxygen back into the river and reduce any further impact from the sewage works.” The Court also heard how on 30 September 2012 Thames Water reported to the Environment Agency that there was an illegal storm discharge from their storm tanks at the same STW. The discharge of effluent into the river via the storm tanks lasted an hour. In an interview under caution, the company accepted that it was not rainfall or snowmelt that caused this discharge but rather a build up of rags (toilet paper and sewage debris etc) creating a blockage which diverted screened raw sewage to the storm tanks rather than going for full treatment. This resulted in storm tanks filling and an illegal discharge of sewage into the River Blackwater. Judge Lucas concluded that the company was negligent in allowing the blockage to occur, and that a discharge of that nature would have resulted in some harm to the water quality.” Andrew Valantine added: We take these types of incidents very seriously and will do everything within our powers to safeguard the environment and people affected, and that includes bringing those who harm the environment to account for their actions. Judge Lucas QC stated that: It is important that the courts send out a clear message to Thames Water and all companies operating in this sector. Regulations are there to protect the environment and that the courts will act firmly where regulations are breached and where the environment is either damaged or put at risk of damage.” Ends Notes to Editors THAMES WATER UTILITIES LTD (TWUL) of Clearwater Court, Vastern Road, Reading, Berkshire, RG1 8DB: On or before 7 September 2012 did contravene Regulation 12 (1)(b) of the Environmental Permitting (England & Wales) Regulations 2010, in that the company caused a water discharge activity namely the discharge of sewage to the River Blackwater except under and to the extent authorised by environmental permit ref CNTD.0024 at Camberley Sewage Treatment Works, Camberley, Surrey.

/government/news/annual-beach-recycling-underway-in-norfolk,"Environment Agency contractors start work today on annual maintenance of the shingle embankment and beach between Snettisham and Hunstanton.  Annual beach recycling underway in Norfolk  Environment Agency The work, which helps protect people and 2,935 properties from tidal flooding, is expected to take 3 weeks. The embankment is a ‘soft’ sea defence, which requires annual maintenance to repair any damage or loss of material sustained over the winter period. Ryan Ely, Environment Agency Flood and Coastal Risk Advisor, said: We generally re-use around 7,000 cubic metres of sand and shingle to reinforce the defences, with this stage of the work bringing the defences back to the right standard. This process is known as beach recycling and is the most sustainable way to protect the coast in this location. Dumpers will move sand and shingle from Snettisham Scalp, where it is naturally deposited by the sea over the winter, back to areas of the shingle ridge and beach that have lost material. It is then shaped by bulldozers to ensure the width, height and profile of the shingle ridge and beach is reinstated so that the ridge continues to protect the coastal community from flooding. The Environment Agency monitors beach levels throughout the year to determine how much material will need to be taken from Snettisham Scalp and where it will need to be placed. The project is carried out in consultation with Natural England and the RSPB due to the environmental importance of this coastline. The Environment Agency carries out ecological monitoring to ensure there is no long term detrimental effect on the ecology of the area. The work is being carried out before the start of the bird breeding season and will be completed before the start of the main tourist season. The cost of the project is likely to be between £130,000 and £180,000 this year. The Wash East Coast Management Strategy (developed by the Environment Agency and Borough Council of Kings Lynn and West Norfolk) has helped to ensure that funding for this essential maintenance can continue after February 2016. In accordance with the Governments Partnership Funding initiative, the project needs to gather partnership funding contributions from public sector bodies and the local community (including caravan park owners and landowners) to help protect this coastline in future years. Local caravan park owners and landowners, who directly benefit from flood defences in this area, have already expressed willingness to make voluntary contributions to at least sustaining, and perhaps improving, the defences between Hunstanton South and Wolferton Creek. Good progress has been made to establish a Community Interest Company (CIC) that will be an effective means of managing local funding contributions. The Environment Agency will play a key role in bringing partners together to ensure the annual maintenance work will continue. More information is available by contacting the Environment Agency’s Customer Services line on 03708 506 506. Notices will be put up along the flood banks to make people using the beach aware of the works."
/government/news/good-turn-out-for-saffron-walden-community-flood-risk-drop-in,"Nearly 70 people attended a local event to find out about work being undertaken by the Environment Agency and the risks of flooding in Saffron Walden. Good turn out for Saffron Walden community flood risk drop-in  Environment Agency The event took place on Thursday 19 February 2015 at Saffron Walden Town Hall. Environment Agency staff talked to local residents and businesses about work to clear debris and inspect the condition of the culvert (tunnel) which carries the River Slade under Saffron Walden town centre. The event was also hosted by representatives from Uttlesford District Council and Essex County Council. Staff were on hand to answer questions about flood risk, the current works and to explain the rights and responsibilities of riparian landowners - people who own land next to, or over, a watercourse. Liz Taylor, Flood Risk Advisor for the Environment Agency said: We were really pleased that so many people came along to find out more about the work taking place. It was a great opportunity to talk to residents about how to prepare for floods and provide information about the flood warning service in Saffron Walden. People can check to see if they are at risk of flooding by visiting https://www.gov.uk//flood or by calling Floodline on 0345 988 1188. The Floodline service is easy and free to sign up to. Floodline issues a message direct by telephone, mobile, email or SMS text message when flooding is likely. The Environment Agency also has a new SMART phone App called Flood Alert which can be downloaded for free to phones or via Facebook."

The area has a history of flooding from Rising Brook, with parts of the town centre at risk. The scheme will help to reduce the risk of flooding to over 100 properties and also forms an integral part of the local council’s plans to regenerate parts of the town centre. The proposal includes constructing an embankment and diverting the brook through the flood water storage area on Hagley playing fields. As well as helping to reduce the risk of flooding for residents and businesses, the scheme proposals include creating new wetland habitat, restoring heritage features and reconnecting footpaths and improving accessibility. This should help create a better place where local people can reconnect with their environment and wildlife can thrive. Environment Agency project manager, Neil Lote said: This is a chance for residents and businesses to let us know what they think about the proposals and help shape the designs. We also want people to take the opportunity to input on how we improve the local environment and use of the playing fields. If you are unable to attend the drop-in session you can request to see the new plans and comment by calling 03708 506 506 and asking to speak to the Rugeley flood risk management scheme project manager.

/government/news/give-your-views-on-black-sluice-area-flood-management,"People who live and work in the Black Sluice catchment area of Boston are being invited to give their views on a number of options to manage flood risk there.      Give your views on Black Sluice area flood management  Environment Agency The Black Sluice catchment describes the area of land emptying into the South Forty Foot Drain, which extends from Boston across the South Lincolnshire fens. The Environment Agency manages flood risk within the South Forty Foot Drain and through the Black Sluice pumping station and sluices in Boston, where the water discharges into the Haven. Public events will be held at Billingborough village hall on 11 March from 12pm – 7pm and at Bicker village hall on 12 March from 12pm – 7pm. Photos and information will be on display, and project team members will be on-hand to answer questions. The events will present options for Swaton, Billingborough and areas around the South Forty Foot Drain. There is a history of flooding in the area – mostly from rivers, but also from surface, ground and tidal waters. Kevin Abbott, Flood and Coastal Risk Management (FCRM) Advisor for the Environment Agency, said: We do annual maintenance in this area to reduce the risk of flooding, but the Black Sluice pumping station is now in need of significant investment. To provide value for money and find the best solution, we are looking at a variety of options across the whole catchment – and we’d like to take your opinions into account when making a decision. The pumping station was flooded and three pumps were damaged during the tidal surge of December 2013. The remaining two pumps are 50 years old and near the end of their operational life. Refurbishment of the pumping station could cost approximately £15–20m."
/government/news/a-new-era-for-benson-weir,"The Environment Agency has recently completed important maintenance and repair work on Benson Weir in South Oxfordshire.  A new era for Benson Weir  Environment Agency The Environment Agency has recently completed important maintenance and repair work on Benson Weir. This is one of the oldest locks on the Thames which can be traced back to the 14th Century. The weir is made up of both hand operated and mechanically operated weir gates and an overspill weir to control the level of water in the river. Work on the site has recently been completed by a team of 5. Barry Russell, Area Operational Manager, Environment Agency said: Our role in ensuring that waterway structures remain in good working order is crucial for the success of the River Thames as a navigational waterway. The weir helps with the navigation of boats, reduces the rivers impact on ecology, helps with water abstraction, and also helps to manage flood risk. Our repairs on Benson Weir have made it much safer and easier to use. Works included replacing a damaged A frame and refurbishing the walkway for river users. Benson Weir and Lock history goes back into the late 1300s, when a mill and weir were recorded. It wasn’t until 1788 that the first timber lock was built and later converted to a stone lock in 1870."
/government/news/work-starts-on-teesside-flood-defences,"Port Clarence defences will protect property Work starts on Teesside flood defences  Environment Agency The Environment Agency is to start building flood defences to protect hundreds of homes and businesses from the threat of flooding. Local business Wilton Engineering will manufacture part of the flood defences to help protect its local community in Port Clarence. The multi-million pound alleviation scheme is designed to lessen the flood risk to around 350 homes and 32 businesses. This month the Environment Agency will start building flood defences in the area, with the work expected to be complete in the winter. It’s the first phase of an estimated £19million scheme to reduce the risk of flooding at Port Clarence and Greatham South. The most recent impact of flooding in Port Clarence was seen in December 2013, when a tidal surge combined with high spring tides, affected around 50 homes and businesses. Environment Agency Flood and Coastal Risk Manager, Phil Welton said: The work at Port Clarence will improve on existing defences, and will be a mixture of embankments, flood walls and ground raising. There will also be a section of removable defence along the River Tees so that Wilton Engineering is still able to operate from the river. We’ve been working closely with Wilton throughout the development of the project and they’re playing a key role in protecting their local community. Funding for this first phase of the scheme at Port Clarence, which is costing £3 million, has come from government Flood Defence Grant Aid and Wilton Engineering’s participation and co-operation. Wilton Engineering’s Chief Executive, Bill Scott said: This is a fantastic project which secures the houses and businesses within the community of Port Clarence. We have formed a partnership with the Environment Agency to ensure this project is a successful one and one which benefits everyone here. Having been through the recent flood which impacted on our business we’ve learned first hand the importance of protecting our assets, our people and the community, so this project is close to our hearts and we are therefore determined to ensure its success."
/government/news/waste-company-owner-given-suspended-prison-sentence-for-waste-tyre-offences,"The owner of a tyre waste business has today been given a 15 month custodial sentence, suspended for 2 years, and a 2 year supervision order after illegally storing almost 84,659 waste tyres at several sites in Devon. The case was brought by the Environment Agency. Waste company owner given suspended prison sentence for waste tyre offences  Environment Agency Andrew Mayhew pleaded guilty to 5 offences at Plymouth Crown Court of running a waste operation without the necessary permits, which involved dumping large numbers of tyres at several different sites including Hill Barton Business Park, Exeter; Moor Barton Farm in Tiverton, as well as Dawlish, North Tawton, and Hayedown industrial estate, Tavistock. At the hearing, Judge Darlow described it as a ‘serious offence’ involving a very large number of tyres. He said the law is there for a reason and the Environment Agency had a duty to investigate. Mayhew was also ordered to pay £700 towards the costs of the prosecution. The court heard how Mayhew rented commercial premises from January 2013 to February 2014 and collected or received end of use tyres and then disposed of them by sending them to an illegal place for disposal, abandoning the tyres at the premises either loose or as tyre bales or enter into contracts with haulers to transport them and then fail to pay. This led to the haulers having to dispose of them with the resultant disposal costs. He also left the owners of 4 commercial sites with unpaid rent amounting to £15,220 and costs to remove the tyres of over £14,540. He has also saved legitimate disposal costs of £9,360 by sending 300 tonnes of end of life tyre bales to Moor Barton Farm. Mayhew received considerable advice from the Environment Agency including guidance and general warnings regarding his activities relating to the depositing of the tyres but he deliberately ignored all advice. A spokesperson from the Environment Agency said: The illegal handling of waste tyres is a serious issue that affects the environment and undermines the legitimate tyre recycling industry. We take environmental crime very seriously and won’t hesitate to prosecute offenders. Mayhew conned people into believing he was a legitimate businessman. He got paid to collect waste tyres, then abandoned them at the 4 premises he leased, failing to pay rent and bills in the meantime and left the site owners to pay to clear up his mess. He made some of the waste tyres into tyre bales and sent them to a farm to be buried under a track. These tyre bales were waste. The use of tyre bales is regulated by the Environment Agency and using bales otherwise can be an offence. Legitimate tyre recycling businesses operate on tight margins. Mayhew deliberately profiteered by not running his business properly. If you flout environmental law, then we will not hesitate to take action. The cost to the Environment Agency of investigating and concluding this case has been incurred in a bid to protect the environment and ensure a level playing field for the tyre recycling industry. The judge criticised Mayhew’s unacceptable attitude towards Environment Agency staff saying he had been ‘abusive and threatening’. Mayhew admitted to 5 counts of operating a regulated facility without an environmental permit contrary to Regulations 12(1)(a) and 38(1)(a) of the Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2010, and received a 15 month custodial sentence suspended for 2 years and a 2 year supervision order.

You can only store (‘stockpile’) material that contains POPs if you have a legal use for it, under exceptions to the POPs ban . You’re responsible for knowing if your material contains POPs and if it’s exempt from the ban. If you’re not sure you can: ask the suppliers or manufacturers of the material test the material yourself to find out the concentration of any POPs in it get the material analysed by a laboratory You must dispose of materials that contain POPs that isn’t exempt from the ban as soon as possible. Report stockpiles to the Environment Agency You must tell the Environment Agency if at any time you store more than 50kg of material containing POPs within your business, ie across all the sites that you operate. Any material that contains a POP counts towards your 50kg limit, no matter how low the concentration of the POP within the material. If you take material out of storage to use it, it still counts towards your 50kg limit as long as it remains within your business. For example if you take material containing perfluorooctane sulfonic acid ( PFOS ) out of storage to use in a manufacturing process, the material still counts towards your 50kg limit if you carry out the manufacturing process within your business.

Boston residents urged to sign up for flood warnings as warn and inform work shortlisted for award  Environment Agency The Agency has been nominated for a national award for its work to warn and inform Boston residents about the tidal surge and improve community resilience to flooding – but it is urging more people to sign up to reduce the impact of flooding on their homes, businesses, personal belongings and families. The 2013 tidal surge prompted people in Boston to take action by signing up to receive free flood warnings from the Environment Agency, reducing their risk from future flooding. Since the 5 December floods, the Agency has signed up over 1,250 people to flood warnings direct, completed more than 400 personal flood plans with residents, and held special events aimed at engaging foreign language-speaking communities. However, the Agency is quick to stress that many more people in Boston are still are not registered to receive free flood warnings. Adam Robinson, Boston Barrier Manager for the Environment Agency, said: “The tidal surge of December 2013 had a devastating impact on homes and businesses in Boston. Our teams worked around the clock to warn people in Boston in the period before the flooding and to help the community recover afterwards. “While we are obviously proud to be nominated for an award, we are extremely aware of the distress flooding causes to communities – that’s why we’re still encouraging everyone in Boston and the surrounding communities to make sure they’re registered for free flood warnings and make a plan to make sure they know what to do should flooding happen again.” The Environment Agency has also been recognised for its work to raise awareness and support for the Boston Barrier. Adam added: “We’d also like to take this opportunity to thank all those people in Boston who have contacted us so far about the Boston Barrier or attended one of our drop-in sessions. The barrier is a vitally important project which will reduce the risk of flooding to 20,000 homes and businesses over the next 100 years and we encourage as many people as possible to find out more.” The 2015 UK Public Sector Communications Awards has shortlisted the EA and seven other organisations for the Community Relations Campaign of the Year. The winner will be announced at a ceremony in London in July. People living and working in Boston can check whether they are signed up to receive free flood warnings by phone, text or email from the Environment Agency on the Flood Warnings Direct page or by calling Floodline on 0345 988 1188. To sign up for updates about the Boston Barrier or to ask any questions about the project, email Boston.Barrier@environment-agency.gov.uk or call 03708 506506."

The improved defence will help reduce the risk of flooding to more than 500 homes and businesses including the Haven Business Park. Operations Manager Leigh Edlin said: “The repairs and improvements to the Slippery Gowt flood bank means it can continue to reduce flood risk to people living and working in the area for many years. “Although flood banks help reduce the risk of flooding, it’s still important for people to realise that flooding cannot always be prevented – but you can further reduce your risk by signing up for free flood warnings from the Environment Agency.” Work on the bank began in 2013, when repairs were made to plug a 45m gap caused by high tides combined with the tidal surge, meaning water overtopped the banks and eroded the soft silt beneath. The £500,000 reconstruction work, which was undertaken in partnership with FCC Environment, was completed in April.

From Monday, June 8, the bridge will be closed to cars and other road vehicles to allow for the vital road raising works to take place. It will remain open for cyclists and pedestrians. The road closure is in place for up to two months but the work is expected to be completed sooner. It is one part of a multi-million pound alleviation scheme designed to lessen the flood risk to around 350 homes and 32 businesses. A 35-metre section of the road on the approach to the bridge, which is currently a flooding issue, will be raised by around half a metre. Project Manager Chris Milburn said: We appreciate this may cause some inconvenience for motorists and we’ll be doing everything possible to complete the necessary works as quickly as possible to minimise disruption. The road raising is a vital element of the overall scheme to reduce the risk of flooding to homes and businesses in Port Clarence and while there will be some short term disruption it will result in long term protection for the community. We’re working closely with our partners at Stockton Borough Council and Middlesbrough Council to deliver the scheme.” The Environment Agency began building defences at Port Clarence in March, with work expected to be complete in the winter. The most recent impact of flooding in Port Clarence was seen in December 2013, when a tidal surge combined with high spring tides affected around 50 homes and businesses.

Oxford flood alleviation scheme events increase information flow  Environment Agency Over 6 days from 23 June to 3 July the Environment Agency and its partners are running a series of ‘drop-in’ sessions at various locations in and around Oxford. There will be information on display and experts on hand to talk to. Everyone interested in their work is invited to attend. As well as information on how work has progressed since the Environment Agency first unveiled its flood risk management strategy in 2009, visitors can also find out about the next steps and likely timescales. A key aim of the sessions is to make sure that everyone has the opportunity to talk directly with the technical specialists about the scheme, which will include a new flood relief channel. We really want to hear and act on people’s views on this, said Joanna Larmour, Project Director for the Environment Agency. The primary role of a flood relief channel will be to reduce flood risk of course. But we also want to ensure that any scheme would be as natural, wildlife-rich and attractive as possible. Representatives from all the organisations working on the flood alleviation scheme will be present. Cllr Rodney Rose, Leader of Oxfordshire County Council, said: Plans for the flood alleviation scheme are progressing well, and now is a good time to listen to residents about their ideas and expectations from the project. As lead local flood authority, the county council strongly supports this scheme. We also believe that there are things we can do right now to reduce flood risk, which is why we are supporting many smaller scale schemes around the county. Residents who come to these events can find out more about things they can do in their own properties and communities to reduce the risk of flooding. All the events run from 2.30 pm until 7.30 pm. Dates and locations are as follows: Tuesday 23 June at Kennington Village Hall Thursday 25 June at Abingdon Guildhall Friday 26 June at West Oxford Community Centre Tuesday 30 June at Oxford Town Hall Friday July 3 at South Oxford Community Centre The team is also keen to understand people’s thoughts for the proposed channel, and what new environmental features could be incorporated to sustain existing animal and plant life and boost Oxford’s existing rich and internationally important range of habitats. Although a lot of good work has already been done, the project is still in its early ‘appraisal’ stage. Further work still needs to be carried out, relevant approvals gained (such as planning permission), and more funding secured before construction work can start. Cllr Matthew Barber, Leader of Vale of White Horse District Council, said: This scheme is extremely important for people in Oxford and the Vale of White Horse. Flooding in recent years has caused a huge amount of disruption to the area and to people’s lives, so the quicker we can have a lasting solution in place the better. I urge residents who live near the Thames to go along to one of the events to see how the scheme will affect them and provide their feedback on the proposals. Everyone attending the events will be invited to join a mailing list to receive regular updates on progress, invitations to future events and be notified of any consultations. This includes the official public consultation on the bypass channel route and design which the team expects to take place towards the end of this year. Anyone not able to attend an event can join the mailing list, ask the team a question or request information by emailing the project team here .

/government/news/top-10-fishy-facts-as-the-coarse-fish-river-season-begins,"As the coarse fishing season on England’s rivers gets underway, the Environment Agency reveals its top 10 facts you never knew about fish...  Top 10 fishy facts as the coarse fish river season begins Fisheries and rod licensing Environment Agency Did you know that… Many fish – such as carp, chub and minnow – appear to have no teeth but in fact have teeth in their throats, called pharyngeal teeth. Lampreys are the most primitive fish in the world. Fish were the first animals to evolve bony skeletons over 450 million years ago. Brown trout and sea trout are the same species but it is unclear why some seem to choose to migrate to sea while others stay at home. Some trout appear to leave for sea but then change their minds, and are known as “slob trout”. Eels only spawn in the Sargasso Sea and then the young fish can take up to 3 years to enter our rivers. Tench are known colloquially as the Doctor Fish as it was thought that other fish rubbed up against them when injured. The assumption was that the slime of the tench could cure injuries in other fish. The Environment Agency breeds more than 400,000 coarse fish every year for restocking rivers after pollution or to give nature a helping hand. Male sticklebacks, like BBC Springwatch’s very own Spineless Simon, build a nest of vegetation to attract females. The males then closely guard the nests until the eggs hatch. Catfish, a non-native species in UK, has a whopping 27,000 taste buds compared to just 7,000 in humans. The eel is the only UK freshwater fish that can swim backwards. ‘Close season’ – which runs from 15 March to 15 June inclusive – is when coarse angling is suspended on rivers, streams and specified canals and stillwaters to protect spawning fish. Therefore 16 June is when rivers are effectively ‘open for business’ again after 3 months off. To find out more and see some of these fish, take a look at the Environment Agency’s Flickr album Top 10 fishy facts For more on rod licences and how to buy one through the Environment Agency’s web pages or direct from the Post Office Anglers can also buy a rod licence by calling the Post Office on 0344 800 5386 or by visiting any Post Office branch. Alternatively, you can buy your licence through the Angling Trust’s mobile-configured website . Whether at home or on the move, anglers can use this new website to get details on where to fish, tackle shops, clubs and coaches, plus all the latest weather and river levels."
/government/news/chapmans-pond-in-york-remains-closed-to-anglers,"Investigations continue into fish deaths Chapman’s pond in York remains closed to anglers  Environment Agency Chapman’s Pond in York remains closed this week while the Environment Agency investigates several fish deaths. Fisheries officers have taken water quality samples and live fish specimens from the pond, which have been sent the fish health team at Brampton for testing. These tests will aim to establish whether there are water quality issues affecting the fish, or the likelihood of disease or parasites being the cause of mortalities. Pending the results of these tests, the pond will remain closed to anglers for the next two to three weeks. The surrounding nature reserve is not affected by the pond closure, and remains open. There is no threat posed to dogs, or anyone wishing to use this area. Anglers are being asked to refrain from attempting to fish or use any angling equipment in the water at this time. Laura Hogg, fisheries and biodiversity officer at the Environment Agency said: We’ve recommended that the pond continues to remain closed to anglers while we carry out our investigations. Until the cause of the deaths is known, we are advising anglers to remain vigilant, honour the closure notice and follow the three simple biosecurity steps – check, clean and dry, to reduce the risk of spreading any potential diseases. Anglers are urged to: Check equipment and clothing including soles of footwear Clean mud and other debris from boots and equipment on leaving the watercourse. If possible, wash with clean hot water and sterilise with disinfectant Dry all kit for 48 hours prior to reuse, preferably in sunlight The mortalities, which have occurred over the last month, are thought to be predominantly carp. The fish deaths were first reported by The Friends of Chapmans Pond, who were concerned that the number of deaths had exceeded what might be normally expected for natural causes. If you see fish in distress, please call the Environment Agency’s incident hotline on 0800 807060."
/government/news/weir-removal-brings-sheffields-salmon-dreams-closer,"River Don is now more accessible to fish Weir removal brings Sheffield’s salmon dreams closer  Environment Agency The Environment Agency has removed part of a dilapidated weir in Sheffield to help preserve some of the structure while making the River Don more accessible to fish. Work started in April to remove two-thirds of Ward End Weir at Hillsborough, allowing the watercourse to revert to a more natural habitat for wildlife. The removal will leave the Don with one fewer barriers – creating a fish highway to allow salmon and sea trout to return to their historic spawning grounds within and upstream of the city. Fish including brown trout and grayling can now migrate freely up and down the river to find the best places to feed, breed and shelter. Ward End weir was in a poor state of repair and was close to collapsing. It has no registered owner, and if it was left in its current state, it would likely have disintegrated along its entire length over time. By removing a section of the weir in a controlled way, the Environment Agency has safely retained a short section of the weir on each riverbank as a way of preserving a part of the city’s historical heritage. Doing this was more cost-effective than rebuilding the weir and maintaining it into the future. Dr Jerome Masters, Fisheries Technical Officer at the Environment Agency, said: Water quality in the River Don has improved greatly in the past 20 years, supporting a recovering fish population. But many structures such as weirs prevent fish from reaching historical spawning grounds within and upstream of Sheffield. Iconic species such as salmon are a symbol of a healthy thriving river environment that contributes to an attractive sense of place and enhances local development - it would be fantastic to see them in Sheffield once more. Adult salmon are already able to migrate as far upstream as Kilnhurst, near Rotherham, and need only for weirs to be made passable for populations to re-establish in their historic spawning grounds within and upstream of Sheffield. The industrial heritage of Sheffield is of course of great importance, so we have retained about a third of the weir’s length for posterity. Many fish need clean gravel to spawn on. Mud often settles in the slow water behind weirs, smothering the river bed, making it unsuitable for spawning fish. Since the weir removal, the River Don is now returning to a natural series of shallow, fast sections, separated by deeper pools, creating better conditions for the brown trout and grayling that live there and for the invertebrates they feed on. The work has been funded entirely from environmental budgets, and therefore the work has had no impact on funding that is used for flood risk projects. The weir removal will have no effect on flood risk to properties either upstream or downstream."
/government/news/oxfordshire-companies-are-fined-21000-for-deposit-of-illegal-waste,"An Oxfordshire haulage company owner and the landowner of a mushroom farm have been ordered to pay a total of £21,000 in fines and costs for illegally depositing 3000 tonnes of illegal waste at the farm’s site in Bampton.     Oxfordshire companies are fined £21,000 for deposit of illegal waste  Environment Agency Francis Stewart-Wood, the director and landowner of Elmwood Farm, Aylesbury Mushrooms (Farms) Ltd and Stephen Radband of Bampton (a director of SJ Radband Haulage Ltd ) appeared before Oxford Crown Court on 18 June 2015 to be sentenced for their roles in the illegal operation. The court heard how approximately 3,000 tonnes of controlled waste known in the industry as ‘trommel fines’ which can contain various contaminants including gypsum, were illegally deposited at the farm. The material was sourced from one of Powerdays plc waste transfer stations in Neasden, West London. The Environment Agency alleged that the waste had been mis-described in order to justify its use as a growing medium compost for Mr. Stewart-Wood’s mushroom farm and to avoid higher legitimate disposal fees. The farmland did not have an environmental permit or the relevant exemption for the waste to be deposited. One of the waste carriers, SJ Radband Haulage Ltd, had failed to exercise due diligence in ensuring that waste had been properly described or that the farmer had an environmental permit or an exemption for the waste to be deposited there. The duty of care for environmental offences is designed to be an essentially self regulating system which is based on good business practice. It places a duty on anyone who in any way has a responsibility for controlled waste to ensure that it is managed properly and recovered or disposed of safely and in such a way as to protect the environment. The Environment Agency was alerted to the case on 15 June, 2012 after receiving reports of lorries containing, what was thought to be, waste entering a farm gate at Black Bourton. When Environment Agency officers inspected the site they found that the trommel fines had been illegally deposited on the farmland. The Court found that Mr Stewart Wood and his company Aylesbury Mushroom Farms Ltd had acted recklessly and Stephen Radband had been negligent in committing the offences. The Court took into account their financial position in fining Frank Stewart Wood and Aylesbury Mushroom Farms Ltd £10,000 and £4,000 pounds respectively and ordered them to pay a contribution of £2,000 each toward the costs of the prosecution. Stephen Radband was fined £1,600 and ordered to pay £2,000 towards prosecution costs. The waste initially came from a London waste operator Powerday plc, one of the largest waste transfer stations in the South East. Powerday plc at an earlier date (22 April 2014) pleaded guilty to related offences and will be later sentenced at Harrow Crown Court on the 21 September 2015. In an earlier hearing on 22 April 2014 at Oxford Magistrates Court, one of the other waste hauliers of the waste, Fred Sherwood and Sons (Transport) Ltd pleaded guilty to illegally depositing part of the waste and failing in their duty of care. Fred Sherwood and Sons (Transport) Ltd received fines totalling £27,000 and ordered to pay costs of £3,000 by Oxford Magistrates’ Court. Ian Finnegan, waste crime enforcement officer for the Environment Agency said: We take a zero tolerance approach to companies who misdescribe their waste and deposit it illegally. It puts the public and the environment at risk, as well as costing the taxpayer and honest businesses. We are currently working with other enforcement agencies including Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs to stop this continuing illegal behaviour. Anyone who has information on the mis-description of waste and its illegal disposal can contact us on 0800 807060 or call crime stoppers anonymously. More information: Offences: 1 s33(1)(a) EPA 1990 depositing waste without an environmental permit. Trommel fines is a type of waste, often with high soil and plastic content, that is produced at the end of a mechanical process used to separate different types of waste at a processing facility. It often requires disposal in a landfill designed to contain any hazardous or non hazardous properties that result from soil contamination, plaster board or construction materials."

/government/news/first-spawned-salmon-found-in-river-dearne-for-150-years,"Salmon spotted in a South Yorkshire river for the first time in 150 years in what was once part of Britain's most polluted river systems. First spawned salmon found in River Dearne for 150 years  Environment Agency A major engineering project helping salmon return to what was once one of Britain’s most polluted river systems, has achieved a historic success after a young salmon was discovered in the River Dearne, South Yorkshire. An Environment Agency fish survey team spotted the 14cm juvenile when carrying out routine checks last week. The discovery is the first evidence of salmon spawning in the river, which is a tributary of the River Don, for more than 150 years. Once in abundance, salmon populations began to dwindle with the growth of industry. Weirs which were built to power industry or provide deep water for boats also acted as barriers to the fish reaching their spawning grounds. By the mid 19th Century salmon were all but gone from South Yorkshire’s rivers. Last year the construction of a fish pass was completed at Sprotbrough Weir opening up 55 kilometres of the River Don - almost half the length of the river - to salmon and other migratory fish. Jerome Masters, Environment Agency fisheries technical officer said: “Our rivers are the healthiest for more than 20 years and otters, salmon and other wildlife are returning for the first time since the industrial revolution. But there is still more to be done. The construction of the fish pass at Sprotbrough Weir is a significant step in getting salmon back to rivers across South Yorkshire. “The River Don already supports a healthy population of coarse fish, and adult salmon have been caught in the river in the recent past, but the discovery of this juvenile salmon in the River Dearne is hugely exciting. The size of the fish indicates that it was born in early 2014, which means that its parents probably used the fish pass at Sprotbrough Weir shortly after it opened.” The fish pass at Sprotbrough also allows coarse fish living downstream of the weir, like barbel, to reach their spawning grounds further upstream. It reconnects the rivers Don and Dearne back with the Humber Estuary and is part of our grander plan to create ‘fish highways’ providing free passage for fish between the sea and the upper reaches of rivers. The construction of Sprotbrough fish pass was a partnership project, with the Environment Agency working closely with the Canal & River Trust, Don Gorge Community Group, a local landowner and Doncaster Council. The project was funded by the Environment Agency with support from LaFarge Quarries."
/government/news/cambridgeshire-locks-under-manual-operation-this-weekend,"The Environment Agency is operating 2 locks on the River Great Ouse in Cambridgeshire manually over the weekend to keep boaters moving.  Cambridgeshire locks under manual operation this weekend  Environment Agency The lock at St Ives and the Old Papermills lock in St Neots are both awaiting permanent repairs, following mechanical break downs which closed each of them for a short period of time. Low river levels between Godmanchester and Houghton are also causing concerns and boaters are advised to take extra care whilst navigating this stretch of the River Great Ouse. Underwater obstructions may become present whilst levels are low and there is a risk of larger craft coming into contact with the river bed in shallower areas. The St Ives lock has been manned between the hours of 10am and 4pm for a number of days and will continue to be operated manually by trained Environment Agency staff between these hours until Monday (6 July) afternoon. The lock will then be closed on Tuesday 7 and Wednesday 8 July 2015 whilst the mechanical failure is fixed. The lock should then be back in full operation. The St Neots lock failed on Tuesday (30 June) afternoon and was closed to all boating traffic until Thursday (2 July) afternoon. Environment Agency staff have been operating the lock manually since yesterday to ensure boaters can continue on their journeys and will continue to man the lock through the weekend in order to ensure navigation remains open for the St Neots Regatta. Paul Separovic, Environment Agency Waterways Operations Team Leader, said: We apologise for any inconvenience these closures may have caused to our boaters but the use of the locks will need to be temporarily restricted until permanent repairs can be made. This is in the interests of safety for boaters. The gates and their component parts weigh many tonnes, and should not be operated by untrained staff. Please do not attempt to operate the lock or pass into the lock pen unless Environment Agency staff are present. The St Neots lock will be subject to temporary closures over the coming weeks. The Environment Agency will operate the locks manually on a restricted timetable over the coming weeks.

The works will involve the replacement and improvement of existing flood defences, including construction of a new sheet piled river wall. A large crane, known as a piling rig, will be driving sheet piles into the river bed to form the new quay wall. The repairs are anticipated to take place over the next 18 months and will be phased to minimise disruption to the town and its residents and businesses. Speaking about the work Graham Verrier, Area Flood Risk Manager said: We have an ongoing programme of works to reconstruct the flood defences in Great Yarmouth to provide the best standard of flood protection to people and property. The defences were severely tested in December 2013 during a large tidal surge along the East Coast. These new tidal defences will be constructed with a standard of defence that includes an estimated allowance for climate change, this will ensure that flood risk is reduced to the people of Great Yarmouth for the future.

/government/news/rare-fish-returns-to-south-yorkshire,"Sea lamprey found in River Don Rare fish returns to South Yorkshire  Environment Agency A rare and protected fish has been caught in the River Don for the first time in recent history as water quality in the region’s rivers continues to improve. Two sea lamprey were caught during an Environment Agency fish survey on the River Don at Crimpsall, Doncaster. Lampreys are an ancient group of eel-like jawless fish that have lived on earth largely unchanged for 300 million years – appearing about 70 million years before the first dinosaur. The young live in rivers before migrating to the sea. At sea, they use their suction-cup like mouths to attach themselves to the skin of fish, rasping away tissue with their sharp probing tongues and teeth. Adult sea lamprey return to rivers to spawn. These fish are a good indication of the high quality of the river water. Breeding populations occur in North Yorkshire and scientists are currently trying to track down their spawning grounds. Environment Agency monitoring officers were using an electric fishing technique when they came across the sea lamprey. They pass an electric current through the water to temporarily stun the fish so they can be counted, measured and then released unharmed. Darren Rollins, Environment Agency monitoring officer, said: We were catching the usual variety of coarse fish species during our survey when I was amazed to see a sea lamprey rising to the surface. We’ve never caught these fantastic fish in the River Don before. Their sucker-like mouths and sharp teeth make them look very unusual and quite prehistoric. A few minutes later we caught another. There is a chance that they were trying to spawn so we released them back into the water straight away. In modern times, sea lamprey numbers have declined across Europe. Weirs and dams have prevented adult fish from swimming upstream to their spawning grounds. The Environment Agency and its partners, including the Don Catchment Rivers Trust, are now working on a ‘fish highway’ for the river, where fish passes and weir removals provide free access for all species of fish between the sea and the upper river."

People living near Waller Hill Beck and Eller Beck in Skipton, and householders in Glusburn, have been added to the Environment Agency’s flood warnings direct system, and should receive an automated message during the next few weeks with more information. These new warnings have been introduced as part of a regular update process, carried out by the Environment Agency. The update uses new data to provide more timely alerts to help communities to be better prepared for flooding. Flood warnings are provided for all locations where there is a possibility of river flooding, according to the latest computer modelling, even if the likelihood is very small. The Environment Agency is therefore encouraging residents and local businesses to sign up to receive these early flood alert and warning messages so they can be aware of when flooding is possible. Residents in both Skipton and Glusburn can find out if they are eligible to receive flood warnings, and then register, by calling Floodline on 0345 988 1188, or by visiting the website www.gov.uk/flood. This website also includes information on how you can prepare and keep yourself safe. During October and November mobile phone customers of EE in Yorkshire will also be added to the warnings system, if they live in a flood risk area. This will make it easier for people to prepare for flooding, even when they are out and about. Graham Lindsey, Flood Resilience Advisor for the Environment Agency said: We’ve recently started work on the Skipton Flood Alleviation Scheme which will reduce the risk of flooding to more than 500 homes and businesses in the town. However, whilst this work will help to reduce the risk of flooding in Skipton, the risk cannot be eliminated altogether. Rivers in these communities can rise very quickly after heavy rain, so it’s important that people find out whether they are at risk and take steps to prepare.

Hanging out by the river or beach on a hot day is a great way to help beat the heat. But the Environment Agency is warning people not to take unnecessary risks while cooling off and enjoying rivers this summer. Water can contain hazards, particularly in and around structures such as bridges, locks and flood channels. Unexpectedly cold waters or strong currents can also catch bathers off guard. Rivers are great places to have fun, get close to nature and spend time with friends and family, but vigilance can save lives and water-related accidents can be avoided by knowing how to stay safe. Andrew Graham, Waterways Operations Manager for the Environment Agency, said: Rivers are fantastic places to visit during the summer. However, we want people to enjoy them without putting themselves at risk. At this time of year it might feel warm out of the water but river water is still very cold. Over the last few years we have worked hard to get the safety message out to children and parents, stressing that people stay away from the edge, that children must be accompanied by an adult and swimming should be confined to recognised swimming areas, swimming pools and lidos. We often see youngsters jumping off bridges along many of our rivers and, while this may seem like great fun, there are hidden dangers in the water that can cause serious injuries. We are urging parents to supervise their children closely in and around water this summer, and make sure they do not go into the water alone. Notes to editors The Environment Agency has provided some information to consider when planning your days out and holidays, whilst still having fun and being safe: Don’t jump or dive in as the depth may vary and there can be unseen hazards. Don’t go in near weirs, locks, pipes and sluices. These and some other water features are often linked with strong currents. Inland waters can be very cold no matter how warm the weather. Those going into cold water can get cramp and experience breathing difficulties very quickly. Keep a look out for boat traffic. Boaters especially on larger boats can find it very hard to spot and therefore avoid swimmers. Wear a bright swim cap and keep tucked into the river banks. Read the Public Health England Swim Healthy leaflet and follow their advice on reducing the risk of illness. Most importantly, parents and guardians can help keep children in their care safe by: Teaching them to swim Warning them not to go into water alone, or unsupervised Ensuring they know where the children are and what they are doing Supervising them closely when near any open water Remember drowning can occur very quickly even in shallow water and the key to keeping safe is to take all necessary precautions to avoid getting into difficulty in the first place.

Historic bridge reopens after flood works  Environment Agency Teesside’s Transporter Bridge will reopen to traffic on Monday (27 July 2015) after vital flood defence work was carried out by the Environment Agency. The bridge was closed to cars and other road vehicles to allow for road raising to take place as part of the Port Clarence flood alleviation scheme. It remained open for pedestrians and cyclists throughout. It was part of the Environment Agency’s £3million flood alleviation scheme designed to lessen the flood risk to around 350 homes and 32 businesses. A 35-metre section of the road on the approach to the bridge, which was a flooding issue, was raised by around half a metre. Other completed work on the Port Clarence scheme includes flood embankments to the east and west of the Wilton site. Project Manager Chris Milburn said: The road raising was a vital element of the overall scheme to reduce the risk of flooding to homes and businesses in Port Clarence. We’ve completed that aspect of the work and the Transporter Bridge is now open. We worked hard to keep disruption to a minimum and would like to thank residents for their patience. The Environment Agency began building defences at Port Clarence in March, with work expected to be complete in October. The most recent impact of flooding in Port Clarence was seen in December 2013, when a tidal surge combined with high spring tides affected around 50 homes and businesses. The £3million scheme is unusual in that it includes a section of removable defence along the River Tees so local business Wilton Engineering is still able to operate from the river."
/guidance/managing-soil-types,"How to identify and maintain the 5 main soil types. Managing soil types Land management Environment Agency Introduction This guide provides information on how to identify the 5 main soil types, outlines the main characteristics of each soil type and how to maintain good soil structure. It also explains how to assess soil structure and organic content and protect soil from erosion, organic matter decline, compaction and contamination. It introduces the cross compliance soil management standards you must comply with in order to protect the soil, and offers guidance on how to do this. It gives you information and contact details for organisations that can advise and help you to protect the quality of your soil. Identifying soil types and soil structure As a farmer, you will need to know the differences between different soil types and structures. There are 5 main types of soil: sandy and light silty soils medium soils heavy soils chalk and limestone soils peaty soils Download the Rural Payments Agency’s ( RPA ) 2010 edition of Cross Compliance guidance for soil management Assess the soil structure on your farm To check the structure of your soil, you should dig a hole and examine the exposed soil, looking for the following characteristics: Characteristics of well-structured and poorly structured soils   Topsoil Subsoil Well structured Plenty of spaces or pores between the aggregates. You can easily crumble moist soil clumps between your thumb and finger. Larger blocks or clumps than the topsoil, with many vertical cracks or channels. It can easily be broken apart when moist. Poorly structured Dense aggregates of soil with few pores. You will find it hard to break the clumps apart even when the soil is moist. Also dense and may form a hard pan with few pores or cracks in the soil. Below the pan, the soil structure may be satisfactory, or the compaction may go deeper into the subsoil. Good soil structure is very important for agriculture, as it can: increase crop yields improve the quality of crops and grassland reduce the risk of environmental damage - such as water pollution, risks of drought and flooding If you have poorly structured soil on your land, this can also cause problems, including: patchy germination of grass or crops poor growth and greater vulnerability to disease poor drainage - which can lead to increased runoff, erosion and diffuse pollution of watercourses surface capping - which can make it hard for plants to grow and can also cause runoff and erosion You can also find help on identifying soil issues on your farm in the Environment Agency’s ‘Think soils’ manual on soil assessment to avoid erosion and run off. There may be events you can attend in your local area that will provide copies of ‘Think soils’, along with some useful advice. You can find out about local events by calling the Environment Agency helpline on 03708 506 506. Find out about call charges Maintaining good soil structure If you receive Single Payment Scheme ( SPS ) funding or other direct payments, you need to meet cross compliance requirements. The main cross compliance standards of good agricultural and environmental conditions ( GAECs ) for soil management are now incorporated into GAEC 1 and cover: the Soil Protection Review ( SPR ), which aims to maintain soil structure and organic matter, and to prevent erosion post-harvest management of land, which applies if you mechanically harvest combinable crops, and aims to protect post-harvest land from runoff and erosion waterlogged soil, which bans the use of tractors and other motor vehicles on waterlogged land, in order to maintain soil structure and prevent compaction burning of crop residues, which bans the burning of many combinable crop residues, in order to maintain soil organic matter and protect landscape features GAEC standards also require you to protect your soils in order to maintain biodiversity in local habitats for wildlife and wild plants, as well as protecting landscape features. You can find out more about cross compliance standards of GAECs for soil management in the guide on soil use. Identify areas of your farm most at risk Creating a map highlighting areas of your farm that are most vulnerable to soil erosion and soil runoff can help you to manage these soil problems. You can download a Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs ( Defra ) sample risk map in the Guidance for Farmers in Nitrate Vulnerable Zones ( NVZ ) Measures to maintain good soil structure The two main problems affecting the quality of your soil are compaction and capping. Compaction is where the soil becomes squashed together, reducing the space within the soil for air and water, which makes it harder for plants to grow properly. You can reduce this by taking the following measures: avoid cultivating wet soil, where possible reduce the use of heavy vehicles on fields loosen the top soil regularly regularly conduct a check of the subsoil in your fields for signs of compaction, especially after wet weather and during cultivation or harvest remove any already compacted soil that you find Capping takes place when the surface of the soil is broken up by prolonged, heavy rain. Once it dries, this forms a ‘cap’ or hard layer over the underlying soil. You can protect soil from erosion by taking the following measures: work across a sloped field whenever this is safe and possible, but beware of creating slope patterns that may channel runoff maintain crop cover in winter for as long as possible increase the amount of organic matter in your soil to bind it - within the permitted levels of use of farm waste avoid sowing late-harvested crops, eg potatoes or sugar beet, on fields that are more at risk of erosion and runoff, or ensure that you harvest them first in drier conditions plant trees, hedges or grass buffer strips to prevent soil erosion and runoff into rivers and roads manage livestock to avoid trampling of pasture into wet, muddy patches - this is known as ‘poached soil’ avoid out-wintering livestock on slopes if runoff problems are likely to cause soil erosion Managing sandy and light silty soils Sandy and light silty soils naturally drain water well. However, sandy and light soil structure is often weak as it contains little clay or organic matter to bind it together, making it prone to erosion. You will also need to manage other problems associated with this type of soil: capping - this is where the surface is easily broken up by rain and forms a ‘cap’ or hard layer over the underlying soil once it dries slumping - the topsoil may fall apart, causing the soil to slump; the soil may then set solid when it dries out If you don’t protect these types of soil from such problems, they will be damaged by runoff, soil wash and erosion by wind and water. You can protect sandy and light silty soils by taking the following measures: sow winter cereals early to achieve good crop cover before winter harvest potatoes, vegetables and forage crops by ploughing deeper than usual when the weather is suitable avoid direct drilling because these soils tend to slump and will need regular loosening avoid growing potatoes, vegetables, maize and other forage crops on slopes if runoff is likely to cause soil erosion sow nurse crops (plants that assist the growth of the main crop) such as barley to prevent wind erosion, particularly in vegetable crops or sugar beet grown on unsheltered land that is exposed to strong winds Managing medium soils You can manage medium soils on your farmland by using key elements of organic soil management, including: ploughing and cultivating at the correct time, to minimise nutrient losses through leaching liming to provide the optimum pH for nutrient release avoiding bare ground over winter, to reduce leaching regular use of a ‘shakerator’ or ‘subsoiler’ to break up soil pans and improve drainage You can also protect your medium soils by taking the following measures: cultivate and harvest in dry weather where possible, to avoid soil compaction examine the soil structure (especially after late harvesting of crops) and remedy any damage when weather permits if tramlines cause runoff, loosen them with a tine or ‘subsoiler’ when weather and soil condition permits - the soil should be friable Managing heavy soils Heavy soils contain clay, which helps bind soil particles together into clumps or aggregates. Well-structured heavy soil will crumble easily in your hand, but poorly structured heavy soil will not. The structure of heavy soil is determined mainly by the amount of organic matter in the soil. Organic matter helps to keep the clay particles apart, so there is space for air and water. Without an adequate supply of organic matter, heavy soil is likely to become compacted. It will not retain moisture or be able to drain. Compacted heavy soil will easily become waterlogged, and suffer from ponding, runoff and soil wash. You can protect heavy soils by taking the following measures: avoid crops that are harvested or grazed in late autumn or winter - or crops that need ploughing or other primary cultivation in the spring, when subsoils are still wet drain your land - however, to comply with GAEC 5 - environmental impact assessment - you must not drain natural wetlands unless you have consent under the Environmental Impact Regulations - see the guide on  Environmental Impact Assessments ( EIA ) use moling, draining or subsoiling as secondary treatments over pipe drains that have a permeable backfill regularly maintain field drains clean your ditches and cut their banks in rotation only in autumn or early winter each spring and autumn, inspect any heavy soils for poor structure and compaction, and plan to subsoil by ploughing the layer beneath the topsoil reseed pasture which has been made wet and muddy (poached) or loosen the compact topsoil - but avoid bringing soil with low organic matter to the surface avoid spreading manure and slurry when the soil is wet, especially if there is a risk of runoff and pollution Managing chalk and limestone soils Limestone and chalk soils often have a shallow layer of topsoil over the rock below. These soils usually have a good structure and are free draining, but if you cultivate these soils on hillsides, there is a risk of tillage creep. This is where the soil gradually slides down the hill, exposing the rock. These soils are also liable to runoff and erosion on slopes, particularly from compacted headlands and tramlines. You can protect chalk and limestone soils by taking the following measures: avoid deep ploughing, especially into the rock work and sow crops across a slope where possible turn soil up the slope when ploughing, where possible loosen tramlines to increase infiltration of water subsoil compacted gateways and headlands, during dry enough weather carry out only minimum cultivation on thin chalk and limestone soils Managing peaty soils To protect and manage any peaty soil on your land, you should: sow a ‘nurse crop’ to provide shelter for spring crops before drilling - this will prevent wind erosion of your fenland soils reduce wind erosion with shelterbelts - a plantation of trees or shrubs that act as a wind break follow environmental impact assessment regulations if you want to bring undrained lowland and upland peat bogs into intensive agricultural production - see the guide on EIA minimise damage to plant cover on upland or lowland peat soil by complying with GAEC 9 on overgrazing and unsuitable supplementary feeding - see the guide on hill farming . ensure you protect your heathland soils from erosion when carrying out controlled burning - see the guide on heather and grass burning Organic soil management Correct soil management is crucial on an organic farm. The soil must provide most of the nutrients for crop and grass growth. Sources of nutrients Soil - and the rock minerals and organic matter contained in it - provide many of the nutrients for plant growth on an organic farm. Leguminous plants - particularly clovers - are an important source of organic matter and soil fertility. Nodules on their roots convert nitrogen in the air into soluble nitrate ‘fertiliser’ which passes into the surrounding soil. Farmyard manures, composts and slurries also provide organic nutrients for soil - including phosphate, potash and other nutrients. If you are applying any organic or inorganic waste materials to your land you must comply with the relevant waste exemption or permit, which can be obtained from the Environment Agency. You can find out about registering agricultural waste exemptions . If you are using high-quality, source-separated green compost on your farm, you may be able to use The Compost Quality Protocol which removes the need for regulatory controls. You can download compost quality protocol guidance You should always store your manure and slurry in a way that prevents loss of nutrients. (Manure should be stored in field heaps and slurry in a sealed tank.) You can also compost manures, which makes the product more stable. As well as increasing and protecting the organic matter in your soil, there are several other key elements of organic soil management, including: timing your ploughing and cultivation correctly to prevent losing your soil’s nutrients from leaching or from being released in to the atmosphere liming your soil to provide the optimum pH for nutrient release reducing leaching of nutrients by keeping ground cover on your soil over winter regular cultivation such as subsoiling, lifting or ploughing, or by using a shakerator, to break up soil pans and improve drainage Further information Environment Agency Agricultural Waste helpline 0845 603 3113 Environment Agency helpline 03708 506 506 Soil Association Farmers’ and Growers’ enquiries 0117 914 2400 Environment Agency Incident hotline 0800 80 70 60 Natural England Enquiry Service 0845 600 3078 RPA Customer Service Centre 0845 603 7777 Defra helpline 08459 33 55 77 Cross Compliance helpline 0845 345 1302 Find out about call charges Download the RPA ’s 2010 edition of Cross Compliance guidance for soil management Download Defra ’s water, soil and air protection guidance Download the ‘Think soils’ manual Download Defra ’s NVZ guidelines for farmers Download Natural England’s organic farming information Composting and organic soil management advice Registering agricultural waste exemptions Download compost quality protocol guidance"
/government/news/construction-begins-on-the-perry-barr-and-witton-flood-risk-management-scheme,"Construction has begun on Phase 1 of the Perry Barr and Witton Flood Risk Management Scheme, which will help to reduce flood risk to over 1,400 properties, including 950 homes.  Construction begins on the Perry Barr and Witton Flood Risk Management Scheme  Environment Agency Phase 1 of the £28 million scheme involves rebuilding existing flood walls along Brookvale Road and constructing new walls alongside Atlas Industrial Estate and behind the warehouses along Tame Road. As well as this, work will begin to stop water flowing underneath the railway line between Electric Avenue and the A38. A redundant sewer which crosses the River Tame at Walker Drive will also be removed. A planning application for Phase 2 is scheduled to be submitted later next year with construction planned for early 2017. Phase 2 of the scheme involves increasing the capacity of the existing flood storage reservoir at Forge Mill Lake in the Sandwell Valley. Design of this Phase is not yet complete, but it is likely it will involve construction of new embankments and a flood gate to control flows down the river. Once completed, the works in the Sandwell Valley will work in combination with the Phase 1 works to reduce flood risk for residents and businesses in Perry Barr and Witton. The Environment Agency has also been working with MADE, an organisation dedicated to improving the quality of cities, towns and villages, on the design of some elements of the scheme. The Environment Agency has supported MADE and the local community on a new initiative, entitled ‘Tamed’ to aesthetically improve these flood walls throughout Witton. The walls will be transformed into works of art which also reflect the history of the area. ‘Tamed’ will use pledges from local businesses and the public to deliver these elements of the scheme, more information can be found on MADE’s crowdfunding page , launched earlier this month. Rachel Kelly, Project Manager said: We’re really pleased that works have now begun. As well as helping to reduce flood risk, we hope these defences will be an integral part of the community.

/government/news/stockton-man-fined-4800-for-waste-crimes,"Investigation revealed hazardous waste stored illegally Stockton man fined £4,800 for waste crimes  Environment Agency A Stockton-on-Tees man has been fined a total of £4,800 after he admitted illegally storing thousands of litres of hazardous waste. Glenn Walsh, aged 53, of Blue House Point Road, Portrack, admitted two offences of failing to comply with his environmental permit, one offence of storing controlled waste without a permit and one offence of failing to contain the waste. Walsh appeared at Teesside Magistrates Court on 28 July and was fined £1,200 for each offence. The case was brought by the Environment Agency and Walsh was also ordered to pay its full court costs of £6,065.95. The court was told the defendant owns Stockton Industrial Services (SIS) Plastic Recyclers in Stockton which is permitted to accept and sort clean plastic containers, ready for processing elsewhere. The permit doesn’t allow for the emptying and washing of containers, and any residue left in a container is classed as hazardous waste and cannot be accepted or stored on site. Environment Agency solicitor Julie Fisher told the court that in September 2014 an officer was carrying out a routine inspection of the site when he saw a large number of square drums which are used in industry to transport liquid. The containers were in an inaccessible location so the officer served a notice on Walsh forbidding him to move them and requiring him to make the area easier to inspect. Magistrates heard that during the officer’s return visit, he saw a red curtain-sided trailer parked on a nearby side road. The trailer appeared to be carrying a heavy load and a dark liquid was dripping from the vehicle towards a surface water drain. Enquiries revealed the trailer had been hired by Walsh, who when questioned, admitted he had panicked and tried to conceal the containers in the trailer. Ms Fisher said that during interview with Walsh, officers estimated between 30 to 40,000 litres of hazardous liquid had been on the site. Tests showed the liquids to be mineral oil, edible oil and solvents. In court Walsh admitted 12,000 litres had been removed from the site. She said that when Walsh was interviewed under caution by the Environment Agency, he admitted that sometimes the containers accepted on to his site had small amounts of liquid in them. He told officers he had intended to dispose of the waste legally but never had the money to do it and over a period of 12 years, this waste had accumulated. In mitigation, the court heard that Walsh had cooperated with the investigation and had since cleared his site of all hazardous waste material. Magistrates told the defendant that there was a serious risk of harm if a fire had broken out due to the large amount of hazardous waste on his site. Speaking after the court case, Environment Agency team leader Tristan Drought said: We take waste crime extremely seriously. Our permits are in place to protect people and the environment, and the illegal storage of hazardous waste can have potentially devastating consequences. We urge everyone to be on the alert for waste crime. If you suspect a business near you of illegally handling or storing waste then report it to us anonymously through Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."
/government/news/boston-barrier-community-hub-opens-to-the-public-next-week,"The Boston Barrier will take another important step forward with the opening of the Boston Barrier Community Hub on 5 August. Boston Barrier community hub opens to the public next week  Environment Agency Residents can visit the hub to find out the latest information about the tidal barrier and meet with the project team to ask any questions. The Boston Barrier community hub will be opened with a ribbon-cutting ceremony by the Deputy Mayor of Boston, Councillor Colin Brotherton, followed by guided tours for visitors. Adam Robinson, Boston Barrier Manager for the Environment Agency, said: “We want to give everyone living in Boston borough a focal point to find out more about the Boston Barrier. “This important tidal flood defence will reduce the risk of flooding to 20,000 properties over the next 100 years, so we want to discuss proposals with as many people as we can while we develop the scheme.” The community hub, located on Marsh Lane in the Riverside Industrial Estate, will open on 5 August between 10am and 4pm. To begin with, the Environment Agency plans to open the community hub every Wednesday from 10am to 4pm – although it may open more at key periods as the scheme progresses. It will also be a place to find out more about the other Environment Agency projects happening in the area. The Boston Barrier scheme is expected to be completed by December 2019."
/government/news/skipton-residents-invited-to-find-out-about-flood-defences,"Drop-in session to be held in flood-prone North Yorkshire town Skipton residents invited to find out about flood defences  Environment Agency Work to improve flood defences in parts of Skipton town centre in North Yorkshire are set to start in September and local residents and business owners are being invited to a drop-in meeting to see how it will affect them. Four sites in the town centre have been targeted for improvements as part of the Environment Agency’s £13 million Skipton Flood Alleviation Scheme. These are at Devonshire Place, where a new wall is needed on one side of Waller Hill Beck behind residential and business properties; at nearby Ginnel Mews, where an existing wall needs replacing; construction of new walls on either side of Eller Beck next to Morrison’s supermarket and minor improvement works near Spindle Mill. The drop-in meeting will be held at the Friends Meeting House, The Ginnel, Newmarket Street between 3pm and 7pm on Tuesday 11 August 2015. Members of the Environment Agency project team and representatives from its contractors, who will be undertaking the works, will be in attendance to answer any questions and to address any local concerns. Jenny Cooke, Environment Agency project manager, said While we there will inevitably be some local disruption during the construction period, we want to ensure that everything possible is done to minimise it. We want to give local people the opportunity to air any concerns they may have before we arrive on site so we can take account of any issues raised before we finalise our ways of working. The Skipton Flood Alleviation Scheme will reduce the risk of flooding from Eller Beck and Waller Hill Beck which often swell very quickly after heavy rain. Two flood storage areas upstream of Skipton will be built to slow the flow of water from surrounding hills, reducing the risk of the watercourses overtopping in the town centre. Work on the first of these – at Eller Beck near Skipton Golf Club – has already begun and it is hoped that construction of a second dam across Waller Hill Beck will start later this summer. Skipton has a long history of flooding and the cost of a major flood in the town would run into many millions of pounds, with hundreds of homes and businesses at risk. It is estimated that economic damage alone would add up to £15 million. There could also be a significant threat to human life caused by the rapid onset of flooding. Members of the Environment Agency’s flood resilience team will also be on hand to explain ways to be prepared for flooding, including registering for the free flood warning service. Team member Graham Lindsey said: In June, we improved the flood warning service in Skipton in line with our latest information about flood risk from the local rivers. This resulted in more than 1,100 additional properties being highlighted, including some along Waller Hill Beck. The drop-in meeting will be a great opportunity to come along and find out how the flood warning service works, as well as getting hints and tips about how to stay safe and be prepared for flash floods.

/government/news/safe-haven-created-for-native-species-on-leeds-stream,"Natural techniques have been used to create crayfish habitat. Safe haven created for native species on Leeds stream  Environment Agency A safe haven for a protected native species has been created using natural engineering techniques. The Environment Agency and Yorkshire Wildlife Trust have worked in partnership to stabilise the banks of a stream in Leeds and build refuges for the native white-clawed crayfish, using willow spiling. The area has an established population of native white-clawed crayfish, but was identified as in need of possible habitat improvement because there were many eroded banks with very little vegetation or suitable areas for the crayfish to burrow into. Eroding riverbanks can cause problems for crayfish habitats because the eroded sediment can cause siltation and pollution of the stream blocking potential refuges for the crayfish and altering the quality of the water. A bank that is eroding is also unstable and unsuitable habitat for crayfish as it will not give adequate protection against fast flowing water. Up to 100 metres of willow spiling and bundling has been built along the stream. The technique used for the willow spiling involves weaving willow between stakes on the bank to form a strong willow wall. Live willow was used so that it will root and grow creating a strong hedge that protects the bank from further erosion and provide habitat for crayfish. Ian Marshall, biodiversity officer at the Environment Agency said: The stream has suffered from excessive siltation which has impacted on fish and rare invertebrate communities living in it. However, by working closely with our partners to tackle erosion in a sustainable way, we have given the area the opportunity to improve for wildlife whilst remaining a popular destination for the public. This work also helps us achieve our targets under the Water Framework Directive and pave the way for future partnership working across Yorkshire. Elspeth Robinson, project assistant at the Yorkshire Wildlife Trust said: I worked with several groups of fantastic volunteers over the course of two weeks to install the willow habitat along the beck. The willow has now started to sprout and is establishing along the banks, providing stability against erosion and brilliant habitat for the crayfish. We have much more willow spiling and bundling planned for other streams around Leeds to help secure our populations of native white-clawed crayfish. White clawed crayfish have been significantly threatened in this country by the invasion of the non-native American signal crayfish, and crayfish plague. Native white-clawed crayfish have no natural defence against the plague. Once the fungal disease has become established, an entire population can be wiped out in just a week. The Environment Agency and its partners are working to establish safe havens on other streams to help protect the species. White-clawed crayfish are Britain’s only native freshwater crayfish. They are protected under Schedule 5 of the Wildlife & Countryside Act 1981 . It is an offence to intentionally take white-clawed crayfish from the wild."
/government/news/work-begins-on-flood-alleviation-schemes-in-louth-and-horncastle,"Construction on long-awaited flood alleviation schemes in Louth and Horncastle is set to start this month.  Work begins on flood alleviation schemes in Louth and Horncastle  Environment Agency The schemes will see flood storage reservoirs built outside the towns to help manage flows on the Rivers Lud and Bain when these are high. Both rivers most recently flooded in 2007, affecting 200 properties. Planning permission for both schemes has been granted, archaeological surveys of the sites are being carried out, and construction will begin shortly. Every effort will be made to minimise any disruption from the work to local residents, although no disruption is expected, and both schemes should be completed by spring 2016. The £6.5m Louth scheme and the £8.1m Horncastle scheme are funded and delivered by a partnership of Lincolnshire County Council, the Environment Agency, East Lindsey District Council, and the Lindsey Marsh and Witham Third Internal Drainage Boards. The ongoing maintenance will be funded by Louth and Horncastle Town Councils. The Environment Agency has led on developing the scheme and construction will be undertaken by their contractors. Environment Agency Flood and Coastal Risk (FCRM) Manager Deborah Campbell – chair of the project board – said: “Seeing the Louth and Horncastle flood alleviation schemes built is a huge success for the local communities and all the agencies involved. It is the result of close cooperation and partnership working over a period of years. “These flood storage reservoirs will help reduce the risk of river flooding to hundreds of houses and businesses in these towns – something we have seen happen multiple times in the past. However, we’d still encourage people to sign up for free flood warnings from the Environment Agency to ensure communities are aware and can take timely appropriate action.” Key information about the Louth flood alleviation scheme: Two reservoirs will be built outside Louth; 1 will be located off the A157 adjacent to the A16, and the other will be off Halfpenny Lane, also adjacent to the A16. Planning permission was granted by East Lindsey District Council in April. The reservoirs will reduce the risk of flooding to 355 properties at risk from the River Lud. The north reservoir’s embankment will measure 150m long and the south reservoir will measure 200m. Key information about the Horncastle flood alleviation scheme: The reservoir will be located off the B1225 north of Hemingby. Planning permission was granted by East Lindsey District Council in June. The reservoir will reduce flood risk from the River Bain to 170 properties in Horncastle, plus properties in the downstream villages of Haltham and Kirkby-on-Bain. The embankment of the reservoir will measure 800m long.

/government/news/public-consultation-to-open-on-flood-risk-black-sluice-catchment,"A six-week public consultation on how to best manage future flood risk in the Black Sluice catchment begins on August 17 Public consultation to open on flood risk Black Sluice catchment  Environment Agency The Black Sluice catchment is the area around the South Forty Foot Drain where water flows into the River Haven. It includes the Black Sluice Pumping Station and the villages of Swaton and Billingborough, which have previously experienced both surface water and river flooding. The catchment is predominantly prime agricultural land. The Environment Agency’s priority is to protect people and their homes, but flood risk to farming and national food security is also an important consideration. The consultation seeks views on a number of options to reduce flood risk for the catchment as a whole, as well as options for the future of the pumping station. The pumping station was built in 1946 and all five of its pumps are at the end of their working life. Options specifically for the future of the pumping station include replacing the pumps, removing them, or transferring them to the local internal drainage board. Deborah Campbell, Flood Risk Manager at the Environment Agency, said: We’ve been looking at flood risk management here since 2012, and it makes more sense for us to look at the catchment as a whole, rather than just the pumping station in isolation. This will allow us to make best use of Government funding to reduce the risk to people’s homes and businesses.” The pumping station was never built to reduce flood risk to people’s homes, but rather to drain water from surrounding land. We want to reassure people that from our initial surveys, no homes would be at an increased risk if the pumps were decommissioned.” While the Black Sluice pumping station does reduce flood risk to areas of agricultural land, this isn’t enough for Government to fund all the work, based on the Government funding formula we have to use. Our investigations have shown us that all the other drainage and flood risk structures in the catchment provide far more protection to this nationally important area for food production. This is why we are considering a range of options throughout the catchment, and we will continue our ongoing work and maintenance in the area to reduce the risk of flooding.” Deborah continued: This consultation is a chance for you to tell us your thoughts, and your views will help bring to light any other factors we should take into account when considering our realistic options.” A series of information events have also been scheduled where people can come and learn more about the options: Monday, 17 August, 10am – 3pm, Black Sluice Internal Drainage Board office (address) Tuesday, 25 August, 1pm – 8pm, Billingborough Village Hall Tuesday, 1 September, 10am – 3pm, Black Sluice Internal Drainage Board office Thursday, 10 September, 1pm – 8pm, Rippingale Village Hall Monday, 14 September, 10am – 3pm, Black Sluice Internal Drainage Board office Tuesday, 22 September, 1pm – 8pm, Bicker Village Hall The consultation can be accessed on our website from 17 August.

/government/news/oxford-flood-alleviation-scheme-update,"This summer, 2015, the Environment Agency and its partners held public events across the Oxford area to update communities on flood work. Oxford Flood Alleviation Scheme update  Environment Agency During June and July the Environment Agency and its partners held 5 public events across the Oxford area. The aim of these events was to update local communities on the work to significantly reduce the risk of flooding in the city. These events were also set up to offer local communities and residents the opportunity to talk to the technical specialists who are working on the project and to provide them with valuable information about the local area. The events were attended by nearly 300 people, with over 135 attendees completing feedback questionnaires about their views on the scheme. The Environment Agency has now been through all of these questionnaires and collated all of the detail. Feedback from these events indicates that local residents are passionate about Oxford’s rich history, culture, environment and wildlife. Many residents and local community groups are pleased that the scheme is being developed to reduce flood risk and are keen for any scheme to work with the existing landscape. Where possible, enhancing the environment to improve biodiversity and improving recreational use of the flood plain was noted. Suggestions including additional cycle routes, public footpaths and fishing facilities were also made. The project team are now looking at these ideas to see what might be feasible and this information could prove vital as the design of the scheme progresses. Joanna Larmour, Project Director for the Environment Agency, said: The primary role of a flood relief channel will be to reduce flood risk to people in Oxford. We are continuing to work closely with local environmental groups to also look for opportunities to enhance the landscape character, cultural heritage and wildlife habitats of the area. We will seek to ensure that any scheme will work with natural processes to bring multiple benefits and enhancements to the local environment. Councillor Rodney Rose, deputy leader for Oxfordshire County Council added: As one of the Oxford Flood Alleviation Scheme partners, Oxfordshire County Council fully supported the public events. We were very pleased with the number of people who attended, and with the range of views and quality of information gathered. We look forward to being involved in similar events as the scheme progresses. Following on from the public events, the project team have begun using the information they were given to feed into their evaluation of the options available for a channel route. They are continuing to develop these options and will share these with you at the next round of public events, which they are planning to hold later this year. The team will begin ground investigation work in the area in September. This work is scheduled to take 4 weeks and will consist of digging boreholes and test pits into the ground. The results of this work will help the team to understand the geology of underlying layers of rock and soil and confirm groundwater levels."
/government/news/record-fish-on-the-tyne,"New figures show a bumper year for fish in the north east. Record fish on the Tyne  Environment Agency Record numbers have passed over a Northumberland fish counter. The fish counter on the River Tyne at Riding Mill recorded more than 10,000 fish moving upstream during July – 1,200 more than previous top numbers. And the counter has also recorded the highest numbers this year since it was installed in 1996 – the most fish returning in almost 20 years. Almost all fish counted last month will be sea trout and salmon. The fish counter – in conjunction with video cameras further upstream – means the Environment Agency can estimate the numbers of salmon and sea trout returning to the Tyne each year. The Environment Agency’s Morton Heddell-Cowie, of the Environmental Monitoring Team, said: The River Tyne’s fish count in July has surpassed all previous totals for this month, with a mixture of salmon and sea trout being seen. This is good news as it indicates healthy stocks and a healthy river. Hopefully this will continue and we’ll have another good year for both fish and anglers. We’d like to remind anglers to send in a few scales from the fish they catch and to participate in our Angler Logbook Scheme – which will help us monitor the ages of salmon and sea trout returning to the river and how the river is fishing.

/government/news/landowners-warned-over-illegal-waste-storage,"Recent case highlights costs of waste removal Landowners warned over illegal waste storage  Environment Agency The Environment Agency is reminding landowners of their safety responsibilities with illegal waste storage. It comes after 100,000 tyres and up to 3,000 cubic metres of plastic bales were removed from sites near Boston and Brigg respectively. As well as being expensive to remove and dispose of, waste left like this can present fire hazards and other damage to the environment. An Environment Agency spokesperson said: Illegal waste left can cost thousands of pounds to be removed and it’s important that landowners check before signing a contract with businesses or individuals to ensure the contract complies with regulations. We welcome the successful resolution to these long standing issues at both sites, dealing with difficult waste types. We also welcome the success of partnership work to make sure that sites like these are kept within the regulation and prevent harm to the environment. Land, part of which was leased by an abandoned tyre operation at Holme Farm near Kirton Holme, was sold, with the responsibility and cost of disposing the tyres falling to the new owner. The Environment Agency got involved to advise and ensure the tyres’ disposal was in accordance with regulations. The Environment Agency with the Fire Service had worked with the previous landowner to ensure the tyre bales were stored safely. They established measures such as fire breaks, available water provision and emergency contacts to minimise the risk of fire and potential harm to the environment. At a similar site near Brigg, up to 3,000 cubic metres of plastic bales were stored - on a forged permit - which caused fly infestation problems affecting residents and businesses nearby. While the Environment Agency worked with partners to deal with the pest control, they also kept a relationship with the operator to encourage him to deal with the situation. Although the company went into liquidation after being prosecuted, the operator took personal responsibility for the site and cleared it. The Environment Agency is asking the public to inform them of any illegal activity relating to waste - reports can be made anonymously to Crimestoppers 0800 555 111.

With the expectation of increased storminess and sea level rise, the Environment Agency is starting work on a tidal defence scheme for the area. There are a number of areas within Starcross and Cockwood that have been identified as key flood routes, the Environment Agency will be working with the community and organisations when considering these as part of the proposed scheme. Martin Davies, Flood and Coastal Risk Management Advisor for the Environment Agency, said: In addition to managing current flood risk, the scheme will also help to reduce the risk of future flooding resulting from climate change. The proposed timings will see the detailed design stage commencing from autumn 2015. The Environment Agency is currently conducting research into flooding mechanisms within the area. The project team will be carrying out walkover surveys and site investigations over the coming months, so as to review the quality and strength of the community’s current defences. The Environment Agency plans to identify a number of possible options to address the risk of flooding in the area. These decisions will be made at the next stage of the project following public consultation. Further site investigations and discussions will help the Environment Agency to refine the options and to identify the most appropriate type of defences needed at each location. People will have the opportunity to comment on the initial proposals for managing flood risk during a public exhibition, which is planned for 12 noon on 16 October 2015 at Starcross Pavilion.

/government/news/26-million-flood-scheme-unveiled-to-protect-tourist-town,"A well-known tourist destination in Northumberland, affected by flooding in 2008, will benefit from an innovative £26 million scheme. £26 million flood scheme unveiled to protect tourist town  Environment Agency The Morpeth flood scheme, opening today (Monday 24 August), will protect residents by storing millions of gallons of flood water upstream - one of the largest projects of its kind built by the Environment Agency. The Morpeth flood scheme will benefit more than 1,000 homes and businesses in the town and is the largest flood protection project completed in the North East. The upstream reservoir on the town’s Mitford Estate works by storing up to 1.4 million cubic metres of water when river levels are high – enough to fill more than 560 Olympic-sized swimming pools. In September 2008, severe and prolonged rainfall caused 1,000 properties in the town to be flooded and forced hundreds of people to evacuate. The scheme has also created 17 hectares of new habitat for local wildlife. 3,500 endangered white-clawed crayfish have been relocated upstream of the River Wansbeck – one of the last places in the UK where the native species has a stronghold. Construction has allowed for ‘refuges’ and continued habitat to ensure the crayfish will continue to thrive. The project has been jointly delivered with Northumberland County Council, which provided £12 million in funding – one of the largest partnership contributions the Environment Agency has secured. Sir Phillip Dilley, Environment Agency chairman, said: “With one in six people at risk of flooding in England, flood schemes like Morpeth have a key role to play in protecting people and property, and provide a valuable boost to the local economy. Creating large-scale habitat is also vital to ensuring the survival of the country’s endangered species such as white clawed crayfish. “The success of this scheme is down to the way it has been developed in collaboration with others. In particular, the funding from Northumberland County Council is among the largest contributions received under the partnership funding regime. “We are making record levels of investment, spending £2.3 billion over the next six years to reduce flood risk to more than 300,000 properties in England, and successful partnerships like this, with local authorities and business, will be key.” Construction work on the scheme began in 2013 and has included a new flood wall and embankment along the riverside, over 368m long, including three new flood gates. Repairs and improvements to existing defences have also been carried out, with efforts to ensure that the look of the defences fit with the history and character of the town.

/government/news/burringham-flood-defences-settling-in,"After a summer of investment and building work, the new flood defence is working effectively and provides the protection it was built for. Burringham flood defences settling in  Environment Agency Huge metal piles have been driven into the ground this summer to provide a strong defence against flooding, and as expected during the current high tides we are seeing some water seepage through the ground as the defences settle. The seepage is not a flood risk, is contained through the drainage system and is expected to diminish as the ground settles. Morgan Wray, a team leader at the Environment Agency, said: “Building stronger defences and installing the sheet piling obviously disturbs the ground which needs a little time to reconsolidate around the defences. This is a natural process which is expected and the ground just behind the defences is likely to be wet for a while”. “All of our flood defence work is to protect people and property and the strengthening of the defences at Burringham will do that”. Depending on how long it takes the ground to settle the Environment Agency are talking to contractors about stopping any of the water reaching the nearby road as this could pose a risk in freezing conditions.

Work starts to repair Woodbridge floodwall  Environment Agency The Environment Agency starts work this week to repair the flood defence along the River Deben at Tide Mill Quay and Ferry Quay in Woodbridge. The defence reduces the risk of flooding to 416 homes and businesses in the town. The first stage of the work will involve the Environment Agency replacing the existing defence wall from Tide Mill Way to the railway station. Later on the steel defences from the railway station to Deben Rowing Club will be reinforced with concrete and steel sheet piling. The footpath will be kept open wherever possible and only partially closed for the minimum time necessary to ensure public safety. Diversions will be in place and all businesses and properties will be accessible despite the closures. Graham Verrier, Environment Agency flood risk manager said: Whilst the existing defences suffered some damage in the 2013 tidal surge, they did successfully reduce the risk of flooding to people and properties in Woodbridge. However we need to be confident that any further flood events can be withstood for many years to come which is why this work is so important. The first stage of the work is expected to take 3 months to complete and the existing standard of flood risk protection will be maintained throughout the works."
/government/news/south-west-water-fined-for-breaching-environmental-controls-at-east-devon-sewage-treatment-plant,"South West Water have been fined £45,000 for breaching environmental controls at a sewage treatment plant where a broken screening device, compounded by a series of problems, led to discharges between May 2013 and May 2014 that contained excessive pollutants. South West Water fined for breaching environmental controls at East Devon sewage treatment plant  Environment Agency The case was brought by the Environment Agency. The treatment plant at Dunkeswell, near Honiton, was already scheduled for improvement works when discharges breached agreed limits between May 2013 and May 2014. There had been 5 occasions when waste that entered the stream exceeded the limits for pollution set in the permit. On occasions concern had been expressed about the condition of the site and planned site visits were missed. The court took into account the frequent number of visits the company paid to the site, and the steps that had been taken to rectify problems. South West Water admitted breaching the agreed discharge limits at an earlier hearing in Exeter Crown Court. They were fined £45,000 with costs of £5,700 and a £240 victim surcharge by Judge Phillip Wassall at a second hearing at Taunton Crown Court. Mischka Hewins for the Environment Agency said: There were on-going problems with sludge rising in the settlement tank, which were specifically raised on over 19 occasions and led to knock on problems with the filters. The inlet screen, which is of fundamental importance to the site, was also not working. South West Water should have seen that problems were leading to the likelihood of breaches of permit and done more to prevent it. The court heard the plant had been identified as in need of improvement in 2007 and by 2013 was due for investment under South West Water’s Glidepath programme. A growth in population in the area it served put increased pressure on the Dunkeswell site and most of the problems could be traced to a failure of the screening device at its inlet. This led to a build-up of too much sludge for the filter system which had to be repeatedly cleared by South West Water."
/government/news/cycle-path-reopens-early-as-phase-2-of-whittlesey-washes-work-nearly-complete,"The second phase of improvements to flood banks at Whittlesey Washes is nearly complete, meaning a popular cycle path through the area has reopened to the public 3 months sooner than planned.  Cycle path reopens early as Phase 2 of Whittlesey Washes work nearly complete  Environment Agency The Green Wheel cycle path (route 21) between Stanground and Whittlesey was expected to remain diverted until the end of November, while a low, 249 metre-long concrete wall was built as part of a scheme to improve flood defences. When the whole £26 million Environment Agency-led scheme is complete, a 16 kilometre stretch of the South Bank will have been strengthened. Whittlesey Washes – also known as the Nene Washes – stores water from the River Nene when it is ‘tide-locked’. This happens when heavy rainfall increases river flows and coincides with high tides, meaning the extra water cannot be released through the Dog in a Doublet sluice. As the tide recedes, water is released from the reservoir and into the tidal River Nene through the Ring’s End sluice. Environment Agency catchment engineer Guy Szomi said: “We’re very pleased to be making such good progress on improving flood defences at Whittlesey Washes. Through our teams’ hard work, we’re completing some of this ahead of schedule, meaning cyclists and walkers can get back to enjoying their local area. “The Whittlesey Washes project will improve the condition of the South Barrier Bank so it can continue to protect hundreds of homes, roads, and railways in and around Peterborough, as well as 8,000 hectares of farmland to the southeast of the city.” The remaining phase of the scheme sees bank work being carried out between Poplar House Farm and Bassenhally. While this is expected to be completed in November, a footpath through the area will remain diverted until next summer. This will allow the grass – which adds to the stability of the bank by preventing erosion – to establish. The Whittlesey Washes project is being carried out by the Environment Agency with support from partners including: North Level District Internal Drainage Board, Whittlesey Consortium of Internal Drainage Boards, Middle Level Commissioners, Fenland District Council, Peterborough City Council, Cambridge County Council, Natural England and the RSPB.

/government/news/environment-agency-sends-out-warning-to-failing-waste-operators,"Regulatory appeal highlights the need for firms to operate within the law Environment Agency sends out warning to failing waste operators  Environment Agency A Gateshead company has failed in its bid to continue to operate three waste sites after the Environment Agency revoked its environmental permits. J & J Stanley Ltd, based in Cowen Road, had three of its permits revoked last November and the final one in January 2015 by the Environment Agency, which took the unusual step following frequent breaches. The operator appealed this decision but the Planning Inspector has dismissed the appeals on three of the permits, finding there had been a history of non-compliance and that interventions had to be made to ensure ‘unacceptable’ breaches were dealt with. The final appeal for the Cowen Road waste transfer station was allowed by the Inspector after the firm made a ‘marked improvement’ in compliance after the Environment Agency served the revocation notices. Environment Agency regulatory specialist Carla Metcalf said the decision is a warning to waste operators who continually fail to comply with their permit. She said: Persistent non-compliance is unacceptable and we will come down forcefully on those companies who choose to operate outside the law and therefore put people and the environment at risk. Badly-run waste sites are a major nuisance to the local community due to pollution, odour problems and flies. We want to send out a clear message that this will not be tolerated and we will review all of your permits. J & J Stanley Ltd had permits for a waste transfer station and a metal recycling facility in Longrigg Road, Swalwell, a waste transfer station in Cowen Road, Blaydon and for a scrap metal facility in Factory Road, Blaydon. During the appeal hearing, which took place at the end of August, the Environment Agency was supported in its case by Gateshead Environmental Health. The Planning Inspectorate heard that the breaches included the failure to contain potential pollution on site and failure to make sure waste was secured. Waste crime – such as dumping large amounts of waste illegally, running a waste site without the right permits or not following the rules of a permit – diverts up to £1 billion from legitimate businesses each year. The Environment Agency works closely with partner organisations to target waste crime, which blights communities and causes pollution.

Find out more about Black Sluice catchment works consultation - closing 27 September  Environment Agency Environment Agency staff will be at Bicker Village Hall to answer questions about Black Sluice from 1pm – 8pm on Tuesday, 22 September. It’s the last in a series of outreach events and falls a week before the close of a six-week public consultation on managing future flood risk in the catchment. The Black Sluice catchment is the area around the South Forty Foot Drain where water flows into the River Haven. It includes the Black Sluice pumping station and the villages of Swaton and Billingborough, which have previously experienced both surface water and river flooding. The catchment is predominantly prime agricultural land. The Environment Agency’s priority is to protect people and their homes, but flood risk to farming and national food security is also an important consideration. The consultation seeks views on a number of options to reduce flood risk for the catchment as a whole, as well as options for the future of the pumping station. The pumping station was built in 1946 and all five of its pumps are at the end of their working life. Options specifically for the future of the pumping station include replacing the pumps, removing them, or transferring them to the local internal drainage board. Deborah Campbell, Flood Risk Manager at the Environment Agency, said: “We’ve been looking at flood risk management here since 2012, and it makes more sense for us to look at the catchment as a whole, rather than just the pumping station in isolation. This will allow us to make best use of Government funding to reduce the risk to people’s homes and businesses. “The pumping station was never built to reduce flood risk to people’s homes, but rather to drain water from surrounding land. We want to reassure people that from our detailed surveys, no homes would be at an increased risk if the pumps were decommissioned. “While the Black Sluice pumping station does reduce flood risk to areas of agricultural land, this isn’t enough for Government to fund all the work, based on the Government funding formula we have to use. Our investigations have shown us that all the other drainage and flood risk structures in the catchment provide far more protection to this nationally important area for food production. “This is why we are considering a range of options throughout the catchment, and we will continue our ongoing work and maintenance in the area to reduce the risk of flooding.” Deborah continued: “This consultation is a chance for you to tell us your thoughts, and your views will help bring to light any other factors we should take into account when considering our realistic options.” The consultation cab be accessed on our website until 27 August. You can also send your comments to BlackSluiceCatchment@environment-agency.gov.uk."

The investigations will provide important data on the geology of the area. Monitors will be placed in some of the boreholes to provide additional information on groundwater levels and flows. Work will continue for about four weeks. Joanna Larmour, Oxford Flood Alleviation Scheme Project Director, said: Added to information we gathered in 2009 the results of this work will give us a better understanding of the nature of the rock and soils underlying the area through which the flood relief channel will be excavated. The information on groundwater movements will also enhance our existing information and help us model flows with increased accuracy. Alongside the information gathered during our recent public consultation events we will use the ground investigation data to develop channel route options that provide most benefit for the people of Oxford and the surrounding area. We will seek views on these proposed routes in a further round of consultation events this winter. Trial pits will be approximately 1 metre wide, 3 metres long and up to 3.5 metres deep. Boreholes will be 15cm in diameter and up to 10 metres deep. All locations will be inspected and approved by an ecologist before work starts to ensure there is no detrimental environmental impact. A member of Oxford Archaeology will also be present to record any finds which may be unearthed. All pits and boreholes will be dug and filled in the same day, with no spoil being generated. The data gathered will also inform the waste management plan for the construction phase of the project which will aim to reuse or recycle as much excavated material as possible. Notes to Editors The Oxford Flood Alleviation Scheme is a partnership project involving the Environment Agency, Oxfordshire County Council, Oxford City Council, Vale of White Horse Council, Oxford Flood Alliance, The Oxfordshire Local Enterprise Partnership and Thames Regional Flood and Coastal Committee.

/government/news/village-tree-works-ensure-free-flowing-river,"Clearance works at Corbridge reduce flood risk Village tree works ensure free-flowing river  Environment Agency The Environment Agency is carrying out work to further reduce the risk of flooding in a Northumberland village. Over the years trees and thick vegetation have accumulated on an island in the River Tyne, next to the bridge in Corbridge. The Environment Agency is completing clearance works to clear one third of the vegetation on the island this year, with further clearance works to be completed over the next two years. The Environment Agency’s Duncan Harrison said: The trees and heavy vegetation on the island causes the river flow to slow down and can lead to an increased risk of flooding in the village. Over the next two years a programme of work will see much of the vegetation removed from the island to ensure the River Tyne flows freely. We’ve been in Corbridge this week finishing the first stage of this work. Earlier this year, improvement work to better protect residents from flooding was completed by the Environment Agency, ten years after 54 properties in the village were flooded. Following the 2005 floods, Environment Agency engineers replaced embankments either side of the bridge. And earlier this year a £400,000 scheme to further reduce the risk of flooding in the village was completed. The work involved reinforcing a 400m section of a 60-year-old flood wall to prevent failure during high river levels, and installing a new flood embankment downstream of the bridge to remove reliance on an old lock-up garage to act as a flood defence. The work helped reduce flood risk to around 40 properties in the Stanners area."

/government/news/pub-company-fined-150000-after-polluting-watercourse,"Sewage was not being treated effectively Pub company fined £150,000 after polluting watercourse  Environment Agency A pub company has been fined £150,000 after its sewage treatment works polluted a nearby watercourse in Teesside. Spirit Pub Company Ltd, which runs the Cross Keys Inn pub and hotel at Middlesbrough Road in Guisborough, was prosecuted by the Environment Agency after investigations revealed that sewage was not being treated effectively before being discharged. The inn has an environmental permit which exists to allow the hotel to discharge treated sewage effluent into a stream. The permit contains conditions to ensure the stream is protected from environmental harm. Last year a brown, foamy effluent was seen running into the stream, which is a tributary of the River Leven, and there were solid waste particles present in the water and around the outfall. Representatives of the company appeared at Teesside Magistrates’ Court on Friday 25 September, where they pleaded guilty and were sentenced for two charges of breaching conditions of the permit and one charge of not sufficiently maintaining the sewage treatment works. The company was fined £50,000 for each of the three offences, and has to pay costs of £4,596 and a victim surcharge of £120 – a total of £154,716. David Bradley, prosecuting for the Environment Agency, told the court the brown effluent was seen in the water on 21 April 2014. Samples were taken and the hotel was advised to take immediate action to stop the discharge, but a revisit on 24 April 2014 saw the same brown effluent going into the water from the outfall. Analysis of the samples showed that the discharge significantly exceeded permit limits for suspended solids and biochemical oxygen demand. This had a negative impact on the water quality for a distance of almost 720m and the ecology of the stream for 380m. In addition the pollution posed a risk to livestock which grazed on land alongside the stream. Investigating officers also saw the hotel’s sewage treatment plant was poorly maintained. The treatment works were severely overgrown with giant hogweed, and one of the tanks was full of brown sludge. In his summing up of the case, David Bradley said that it appeared the sewage treatment works were ‘out of sight, out of mind’. The Environment Agency’s Jackie Frank said: There appears to have been no monitoring of the sewage plant between the three-monthly service visits and no visual checks on the outfall. When our investigations found that the treatment works were discharging inadequately treated sewage into the stream we told the company to take immediate action, but no steps were taken to make any improvements to the situation. There were no proper systems in place to monitor and maintain the performance of the works and their emergency procedures failed.” Jackie said the court hearing should act as a warning to other operators who have permits for private sewage treatment works. She said: It’s important to raise awareness of the need for proper checks and maintenance. In this case a contractor was employed to service the treatment works, but this does not absolve the operator from being responsible for ensuring permit compliance. Since this incident it does appear the company has taken steps to put in place systems to ensure the proper operation of the facility, including an alarm to alert staff of a fault, and daily checks on the outfall. It’s vital that operators of sewage treatment facilities make sure they have such procedures in place and that staff are aware of the importance of making sure works are well maintained and the steps that should be taken in the case of an environmental incident. The Environment Agency works closely with businesses to help them meet their environmental obligations and any issues should be reported to them."
/government/news/environment-agency-warns-of-dangers-of-releasing-ornamental-fish-into-the-wild,"Advice from the Ornamental Aquatic Trade Association Ltd and the Environment Agency  Warnings over dangers of releasing ornamental fish into the wild  Environment Agency People looking to release unwanted pet fish into local ponds and lakes are urged to find alternatives as this can have a devastating impact on native species and ecosystems. Ornamental fish such as goldfish and koi carp can carry disease and parasites which can have a devastating effect on coarse fish populations and have major commercial impacts on fisheries. They should be kept in garden ponds and not transferred into the wild. As well as the risk of disease, goldfish and carp can also interbreed with crucian carp, a threatened species, leaving ponds with hybrid populations. Keith Davenport, Chief Executive of the Ornamental Aquatic Trade Association Ltd said: If you choose to own a pet this is a commitment to keep that animal for its lifetime. However, if for any reason you cannot keep your pet for the whole of its life then you should make suitable arrangements to rehome it, making sure of course the new owner has full accurate details of the care it requires. Pet shops, pet societies or rehoming groups may be able to assist. Any rehoming must only be done with whoever accepts the fish being fully aware that in saving one fish they may jeopardise the biosecurity of those they already have. Jerome Masters, fisheries technical officer at the Environment Agency said: Fish movements are regulated by the Environment Agency. Releasing fish into the wild or moving them between or into fisheries without getting consent from the Environment Agency is an offence under the Keeping and Introduction of Fish Regulations 2015. Many pet fish will be unsuited for life in the wild and so their release could also be an offence under the Animal Welfare Act 2006. Angling clubs wishing to move or introduce any fish are required to register their fisheries with the Centre for Environment, Aquaculture and Fisheries Science (Cefas) and obtain a site permit from the Environment Agency. The permit details the species that can be kept in the fishery. A permit is also needed if the fishery contains non-native fish. Introductions or movements may require health checks to be carried out on a sample of fish before they can be consented. These controls are in place to manage the risks posed by spreading non-native fish species and fish parasites, and of inappropriate stocking."

Starcross and Cockwood tidal defence scheme public exhibition  Environment Agency The Environment Agency is currently investigating options to manage the risk of tidal flooding at the coastal villages of Starcross and Cockwood on the Exe Estuary. The scheme is estimated to reduce flood risk to over 600 properties. It was accelerated as part of the March 2015 Budget announcement regarding England’s 6-year flood defence programme. The exhibition is being held from 12 noon to 8pm on Friday 16 October at: Starcross Pavilion Generals Lane Starcross EX6 8PY A range of information will be available about the scheme, including its objectives, the approximate timescales and also how it aligns to the on-going work at Dawlish Warren. People can learn more about how and why flooding occurs at Starcross and Cockwood and the flood routes which have been identified. Over the summer, the Environment Agency conducted research into flooding mechanisms within the area. The team carried out walkover surveys and site investigations to review the quality and strength of the area’s current defences. The results of these investigations and the details of design work progressed to-date will also be available for review. Members of the project team will be present at the exhibition to answer any questions. Charles Hill, Project Manager for the scheme comments: We are keen to invite comment about our plans and to hear people’s views. Therefore, we hope that people will take this opportunity to learn more about our initial proposals for managing flood risk at Starcross and Cockwood. Ahead of the Environment Agency’s annual Flood Action Campaign in November 2015, people can also learn how to be better prepared for flooding and how to sign-up for free flood warnings , via the Floodline Warnings Direct Service."
/government/news/work-on-removable-defences-begins,"Teesside firm's flood defences will protect the community Work on removable defences begins  Environment Agency A Teesside business has manufactured flood defences which will help protect itself and its local community in Port Clarence. Wilton Engineering has fabricated the defences which will act as a removable section of flood defence along the front of its site. And the first sections of the demountable defences have already been put into place. It’s part of the Environment Agency’s £3million flood alleviation scheme designed to lessen the flood risk to around 350 homes and 32 businesses. Work on the scheme that has already been completed includes raising a 35-metre section of the road on the approach to the Transporter Bridge, which was previously a flooding issue, by around half a metre. Flood embankments to the east and west of the Wilton site have also been constructed. Project Manager Chris Milburn said: Work on the Port Clarence Flood Alleviation Scheme is progressing well with some key works, such as road raising and flood embankments, complete. We’re now working on the next part of the scheme, with Wilton Engineering fabricating the defences as the start of construction of the demountable defence begins. This aspect is unusual in that it will be a section of removable defence along the River Tees which will protect Wilton and the local community, but also means Wilton Engineering is still able to operate from the river. Wilton Engineering’s Chief Executive Bill Scott added: Having directly experienced the significant flood during December 2013, we fully appreciate how important the flood defence system is for the Port Clarence community and associated businesses alike. In that regard we are pleased to be able to work in partnership with the Environment Agency in supplying the demountable barrier section which when complete will allow us to continue our business as usual, while maintaining the protection of the wider community. Floods Minister Rory Stewart said: As part of this Government’s long-term £2.3bn investment programme, we are better protecting homes and businesses in Port Clarence from flooding. It is a great example of how the Environment Agency and local communities are working together to reduce flood risk and boost Britain’s economy. Thanks to the innovation and support of Wilton Engineering - local residents will be better protected and business can continue to thrive. The Environment Agency, which is working closely with Stockton Borough Council, began building defences at Port Clarence in March 2015, with work expected to be complete at the end of October. The most recent impact of flooding in Port Clarence was seen in December 2013, when a tidal surge combined with high spring tides affected around 50 homes and businesses. The Environment Agency’s flood schemes have protected an extra 182,000 properties in the past three years – and it’s spending £2.3 billion over the next six years to reduce flood risk to a further 300,000 more properties."

/government/news/flood-defence-work-starts-at-gauxholme,"Construction of a new spillway on the Rochdale Canal to reduce flood risk to homes and businesses west of Todmorden begins next week. Flood defence work starts at Gauxholme  Environment Agency The new spillway at Gauxholme will channel water directly into Walsden Water if the canal overflows in periods of heavy rain. Flood water from the river between Walsden and Gauxholme has often spilled into the canal in periods of heavy rain, sometimes causing it to overtop in the Golden Gardens area, just off Rochdale Road, and also further down at Salford Way, close to Todmorden town centre. This has caused flooding in parts of the main Rochdale Road which has flowed towards Todmorden town centre on a falling gradient, causing significant disruption and damage to homes and businesses. The £500,000 Environment Agency scheme will take about 18 weeks to complete and will complement the £11 million final phase of the Todmorden flood alleviation scheme, completed last year, which reduced the risk of flooding for more than 600 properties in the town. Almost 300 additional properties in Todmorden were protected by earlier phases of the flood alleviation scheme. During construction, the canal towpath will be closed between the Gauxholme bridge on Bacup Road and the next bridge at Rochdale Road. An alternative route will be signposted along Bacup Road and Rochdale Road. Janice Friend, Environment Agency Project Manager said: We’re delighted to be starting work on this project, which will address one of the remaining causes of flooding in Todmorden. The project won’t remove the risk of flooding entirely, but it will reduce the likelihood of the level of disruption and damage which was seen in the valley in 2012. While work is taking place, there will inevitably be some disruption to the local community but we will be doing all that we can to keep this to a minimum. We hope that residents will bear with us while we carry out this work which will benefit the town. In summer 2012, torrential rain across West Yorkshire led to severe flooding in Calderdale. Since then, the Environment Agency and Calderdale Council have invested £1.5 million to reduce flood risk in the valley and are continuing to develop more schemes to ensure that local communities are better protected in the future. Local residents who are concerned about flooding are encouraged to find out about their flood risk, and to register for the Environment Agency’s free flood warning service.

Environment Agency warns maize harvesting can result in run-off and pollution  Environment Agency Although the weather has been dry this autumn enabling good harvesting conditions, the Environment Agency urges farmers to cultivate maize stubble as soon as possible before any wet weather sets in. Stubble left in after harvest can lead to excessive runoff, causing localised flooding and where large amounts of soil enter a watercourse this can cause a pollution incident. Louise Weller, for the Environment Agency, said: In the past, farmers may have been unaware that their land or practices could be causing harm, or that they could face enforcement action if they caused significant pollution from excessive mud in rivers. We have been running a number of awareness campaigns highlighting the problems and find farmers are very willing to take the steps needed to deal with maize stubble. New rules are also now in place where farmers can have farm payment monies withheld if they cause soil erosion. In spite of the later than normal harvest, our advice is still the same - cultivate maize stubble immediately after harvest to remove compacted wheel ruts to allow water to soak into the soil, and if necessary leave a rough surface over the winter period. If conditions become wet do not sow following crops after maize by forcing them into the ground where this would cause further compaction leaving land vulnerable to runoff over the winter.

Work to strengthen River Bain banks continues - maintenance will help reduce flood risk  Environment Agency Sections of the embankment which had eroded were repaired to maintain the strength and integrity of the bank for the future. It’s an example of the work that the Agency carries out along the 1,200 kilometers of river it’s responsible for in Lincolnshire and Northamptonshire. The work is part of the Environment Agency’s £1.8m asset repair programme which, over the next year, will repair approximately a hundred flood defence assets across both counties. Kate Halka, Operations Manager with the Environment Agency, said: “River banks and channels can naturally deteriorate over time, sometimes due to erosion, current, or damage. But we have a regular programme of inspection that allows us to regularly check our assets and schedule in the necessary maintenance. We prioritise all our maintenance work to make sure we’re providing benefit where it’s needed most. “Strengthening these banks means they’ll continue to function the way they should, retaining water and reducing the risk of flooding. But nothing can ever completely reduce the risk of flooding so we encourage everyone to check their risk and sign up for free flood warnings by calling 0345 988 1188.” Nationally, the Environment Agency is making record levels of investment, spending £2.3b over the next six years to reduce flood risk to 300,000 more properties.

/government/news/five-weirs-on-river-nene-to-be-repaired,"Five weirs over a kilometre stretch of the River Nene are being repaired by the Environment Agency.  Five weirs on River Nene to be repaired  Environment Agency The weirs, near Lilford, help maintain water levels in the main channel of the Nene. They allow excess water to flow into other channels when levels are high, therefore reducing flood risk, and also keep water levels in the main channel suitable for boats to navigate. Concrete patching will be carried out to repair erosion and ensure the weirs continue to operate the way they should for the next 10 to 20 years. At the same time, the Environment Agency will also install a ‘pass’ in 1 of the weirs to make sure migrating fish and eels can move upstream to spawn. Completing this work at the same time means it can be done less expensively. Additionally, maintenance work will be carried out on Lilford sluice. The concrete bed of the sluice and the seal on the sluice gates will be repaired to ensure the gates close smoothly and don’t leak when closed. The repairs are expected to be completed in the next 4 to 5 weeks. It’s an example of the work that the Environment Agency carries out along the 1,200 kilometres of river it’s responsible for in Lincolnshire and Northamptonshire.

/government/news/emergency-riverbank-repairs-completed,"The Environment Agency has successfully completed emergency repairs to tidal defences downstream of Bridgwater, Somerset. Emergency riverbank repairs completed  Environment Agency Engineers were alerted after an 85-metre stretch of raised embankment at Stannington’s Clyce (near Cannington) subsided leaving only the crest of the bank intact. The bank failure occurred close to the point where the Cannington Brook enters the Parrett estuary. With high tides predicted, the Environment Agency immediately began planning emergency repairs. A field team has been on site since Wednesday (October 21) driving steel piles into the damaged section of riverbank. There was slight delay after the team discovered buried concrete and stone in part of the bank, but piling work resumed and the repairs were finished by Sunday (October 25). Environment Agency Officer Piers Hooper said: We are very pleased to have completed these repairs in time for this week’s high tides. The highest is on Wednesday so we’ll have staff closely monitoring the embankment over this period. These works are a good example of the Environment Agency’s ability to respond quickly to unexpected events. We’ve come up with a temporary solution and will need to carry out permanent repairs to this embankment at some point in the future.” Engineers are investigating the cause of the bank collapse. An initial inspection suggests any further failure along the floodbank is unlikely. The nearest properties to the repaired section of floodbank are approximately 1km away. The site is surrounded by farmland. The nearest communities are Cannington and Chilton Trinity. Access to the remote site was made easier through the use of a track that was recently upgraded by the Environment Agency as part of its asset recovery programme. Stallington’s Clyce is only a short distance from Cannington Bends where work is due to start next year on a £4 million flood protection scheme.

Major sea defence upgrade between Sea Palling and Winterton  Environment Agency Timber and steel groynes which have reached the end of their working life are being replaced by rock groynes built from 10-15 tonne rocks, similar to those built over the last 15 years on this length of coast. Around 24,000 tonnes of rock has been transported by barge from Norway. Due to its size this main barge will remain anchored offshore whilst a smaller barge will be used to transfer the rock to the beach in loads of around 1,200 tonnes. The smaller barge will arrive at the beach at high tide and unload the rock. The rock will then be picked up at low tide by excavators and placed into its final position. The work is taking place on a sensitive part of the coastline and the timing of it is governed by the need to accommodate nesting Little Terns and the Grey Seal pupping season. The Environment Agency is working with local landowners, Natural England and Friends of Horsey Seals to minimise the risk of disturbing any seal pups. The Environment Agency have also appointed specialists who will be monitoring seal presence and behaviour closely and advising them accordingly. Peter Ansell from Friends of Horsey Seals said: We have been closely involved with the planning and operation of the forthcoming works and are confident that the contractors will make every effort to minimise disturbance to the Atlantic Seal Colony during their breeding season. Currently the seals prefer to rest in the areas around the rock groynes already built, where sand levels are high. We hope that the new groynes will provide additional shelter and attract many more seals and tourists alike. Paul Mitchelmore, Project Manager at the Environment Agency said: This large delivery of rock will take around 6 weeks to offload and position. The areas where contractors are working will be fenced off but otherwise there should be no restrictions to beach users other than the voluntary beach closure operated by Friends of Horsey Seals."

/government/news/married-couple-and-company-must-pay-130000-for-waste-crime,"Two married company directors and company must pay £130,000 for illegally exporting 187 tonnes of electronic waste to African countries. Married couple and company must pay £130,000 for waste crime  Environment Agency Two married company directors and their company have been ordered to pay £130,000 for illegally exporting 187 tonnes of hazardous electronic waste to 6 African countries between 2011 and 2015. Mark Daniels, one half of the married couple, was also given a 9 month suspended sentence. The prosecution was brought by the Environment Agency after their officers found 11 shipping containers full of electrical waste destined for Nigeria, Ghana and Tanzania – where the waste could cause serious pollution, risking harm to people and the environment. The BBC’s Panorama programme fitted a hidden tracking device to a broken television and left it at a civic amenity site in south London. The TV was tracked to Daniels Recycling, a waste site in Warrington, and then back down to Felixstowe port, where officers found the TV in a shipping container. It was seized before it was illegally exported. This evidence formed a crucial part of the Environment Agency prosecution case. These 40-foot containers, each with about 15 tonnes of e-waste inside, had wrapped items at the front, which were made to look like working products. However, further back the container included hazardous cathode ray televisions and broken fridge freezers which were described as second-hand goods but didn’t work. Waste company Daniels Recycling, based in Slutchers Lane, Warrington, had already been served with an enforcement notice by the Environment Agency. In addition to these 11 containers planned for illegal export, the Environment Agency prosecutors told the court that the company had illegally exported another 186 shipping containers to Nigeria, Ghana, the Ivory Coast, Tanzania, Gambia and Togo. Working electronics can be exported for resale and there is a legitimate market for second-hand goods. But the law is clear – it is always illegal to send hazardous electronic waste from the UK to developing countries. Illegally exported e-waste can end up dumped near to homes and rivers where it is melted down to abstract precious metals - this can cause toxic pollution and serious risks to people’s health. The company and its directors, Mark Daniels, (51, of Reynolds Street, Warrington) and Lynn Gallop, (52, of the same address) pleaded guilty to shipping the containers illegally. Mark Daniels was given a 9-month custodial sentence suspended for 2 years and ordered to pay £50,000 Proceeds of Crime Act (POCA) and a £20,000 contribution to costs. Daniels Recycling Ltd was fined a total of £25,000 (£5k per offence pleaded to). Lynn Gallop was fined £450, with £25,000 POCA and a contribution to costs of £10,000. Ezenwa Ogbonnaya and M2 Ventures Limited also pleaded guilty to exporting 6 of the containers, having bought the waste from Daniels Recycling. Sentencing of Mr Ogbonnaya and his company has been adjourned to March 2016. Andrew Higham, who leads the Environment Agency’s National Environmental Crime Team, said: The rules governing the exportation of waste electrical equipment are in place for good reason - to protect human life and the environment. It is illegal to send hazardous waste to developing countries. All organisations handling waste have a responsibility to check they know where their waste is going so it doesn’t end up causing harm to people or the environment. We urge anyone in the waste industry to help us protect their legitimate business and report any suspicious activity anonymously to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.”"
/government/news/new-flood-risk-reduction-scheme-proves-its-worth,"Hebden Bridge works protected properties this month New flood risk reduction scheme proves its worth  Environment Agency A £400,000 scheme to reduce the risk of flooding at Nutclough above Hebden Bridge town centre has been completed – and has already proved its worth. Environment Agency contractors have spent the last seven months constructing a new culvert screen on Ibbot Royd Clough where it passes under Keighley Road. This will significantly reduce the risk of blockages which have, in the past, caused the watercourse to overtop and flood the area. A comprehensive new drainage system has also been installed to catch water cascading down Keighley Road in periods of heavy rain and divert it into the watercourse. Surface water from the hills around the Nutclough area has been a major contributor to flooding in Hebden Bridge for many years and the new drains will vastly reduce the amount of water flowing down, thereby helping to reduce future risk to the town centre. The new works have already been given a stern test over the weekend of 14/15 November when very heavy rain fell on to already saturated ground in Calderdale. The new drains and culvert screen coped with the deluge as they had been designed to do. The difficult geography of the Nutclough site, together with working on and alongside a busy road full of utility services, presented a big challenge to the Environment Agency project team and its contractors who were grateful for the patience and support of local residents during the difficult and disruptive works. Environment Agency Project Manager James Walton said: This was a particularly challenging scheme which took longer to complete than we originally anticipated because of unexpected complications encountered as the works progressed. The co-operation of local residents in often difficult circumstances was, therefore, much appreciated. The work required a lot of detailed design and planning but the end result is that our contractors, JBA Bentley, have constructed assets that we can confidently hand back to our partners at Calderdale Metropolitan Borough Council in the knowledge that they will continue to help reduce flood risk to the local area for many years to come. The Leader of Calderdale Council, Cllr Tim Swift, said: It is very pleasing to see the Nutclough scheme complete. This is the latest milestone in the Council and Environment Agency’s joint work to reduce flood risk across the Upper Calder Valley.

Representatives from the Environment Agency, Hull City Council, the Humber Local Enterprise Partnership, Associated British Ports and the local community will inspect the works which include 1.6 kilometres of new flood walls. The scheme was approved by the Government following the tidal surge of December 2013 when 300 homes and businesses were flooded in the area. Temporary defences were initially provided, and plans were quickly drawn up for improved permanent defences to reduce the risk of future flooding from the Humber at Albert Dock. The work began in November 2014 and has cost £6.6 million, with funding contributions from the Environment Agency, Associated British Ports and the Humber Local Enterprise Partnership with support from Hull City Council. The main part of the project involved construction of a new one metre high flood wall between Albert Dock and the Trans Pennine Trail. The new wall runs for 950 metres, and a further 600 metres of defences have also been built within the port. The Trans Pennine Trail, which was closed and diverted for the duration of the works, has now been reopened. The project also involved the sealing off of the disused Dunstan Culvert to protect the foundations of the existing flood defences and to prevent the river getting behind the defences. Peter Toms, Environment Agency project manager said: The completed defences mean that the risk of flooding for 300 homes and businesses close to Albert Dock is now greatly reduced. We very much appreciate the support we have received from the Humber Local Enterprise Partnership, Hull City Council and Associated British Ports in bringing this project to fruition. Councillor Alan Clark, Hull City Council’s Portfolio Holder for Neighbourhoods and Communities, said: We are pleased to be working with the Environment Agency and other partners to deliver new flood defences are across the Humber in a structured and focused way which supports the protection of people, property and businesses. Partnership working has ensured that this scheme has been delivered within tight timescales and with minimum disruption to the community. This new flood defence at Albert Dock will reduce the flood risk of future tidal flooding and reassure nearby residents and businesses that their properties are safer. Lord Haskins, Chair of Humber Local Enterprise Partnership, said: Protecting the region from flooding is one of the key priorities for the Humber LEP. We were pleased to facilitate Hull City Council’s bid to the Local Growth Fund which has enabled the Environment Agency to complete this important scheme. These works will help to safeguard existing jobs in Hull and enable new developments in the future. This is the first of our Growth Deal schemes to be completed in full and we are making good progress across the rest of the programme. Associated British Ports Director Humber, Simon Bird said: Investment in key infrastructure like this is absolutely vital if we are to grow and develop our business and ensure those companies and residents close to the waterfront remain protected. These new defences will provide security for hundreds of homes and businesses and ABP is delighted that its work with the Environment Agency, the Local Enterprise Partnership and Hull City Council has delivered a scheme that will safeguard the city for many years to come.

/government/news/leaping-salmon-seen-in-rotherham,"Species returns to the River Don after 150 years Leaping salmon seen in Rotherham  Environment Agency Atlantic salmon are returning to the River Don following an absence of around 150 years, with the leaping fish now being seen at Aldwarke weir on the eastern edge of urban Rotherham. Extraordinary footage capturing the fish’s efforts to jump the weir was taken by 18 year old Oscar Downing, whose father, Anthony, is an environment officer at the Environment Agency. Having heard that there had been sightings of salmon in the river, Oscar thought he would try his luck at getting one on film. Only 20 minutes after setting up his camera the iconic fish made its appearance. The presence of salmon at Aldwarke has been made possible by the new hydropower scheme, built and run by Barn Energy, four kilometres downstream at Thrybergh weir. Opened in October 2015, the scheme includes a specially designed passage to enable salmon, other fish and eels to swim upstream. Following the Industrial Revolution, pollution and the introduction of numerous large weirs were both factors in the salmon’s demise in the river. Whilst weirs were necessary for boat traffic and to power industry, they blocked migration routes for fish. Due to dramatic improvements in water quality over the last 20 years our rivers are the healthiest they have been in modern times, and we are working hard to maintain what we have achieved so far and to further improve water quality and biodiversity. This includes building a series of fish passes through the weirs that have blocked the passage for fish. Migratory fish such as salmon and sea trout are now able to swim freely as far upstream as Rotherham. Mark Simon, Chief Executive of Barn Energy, said: It’s fantastic to see salmon at Aldwarke, so soon after our new fish passage was opened. Whilst generating renewable electricity is our number one priority, we also wanted to see salmon safely navigate upstream towards Sheffield. It’s wonderful that they are now doing so, and we hope that we will see a lot more fish up and down the River Don. Jerome Masters, Environment Agency fisheries officer said: 2015 has been a fantastic year for South Yorkshire’s rivers with salmon leaping in Rotherham and confirmation of spawning salmon in the River Dearne. Barbel have also begun breeding in the river following an extensive re-stocking programme we carried out between 2007 and 2011. The Environment Agency and organisations including the Canal and River Trust, Don Catchment Rivers Trust, Sheffield City Council and Yorkshire Water are currently working on further fish passage and habitat improvement projects that will enable these iconic fish to return to their historic spawning grounds within and upstream of Sheffield."

/government/news/new-defence-to-reduce-flood-risk-in-tonbridge,"The Environment Agency has completed a flood defence scheme to reduce the risk of flooding in parts of Tonbridge. New defence to reduce flood risk in Tonbridge  Environment Agency During the December 2013 floods, approximately 80 homes in the Barden Road and Danvers Road area of Tonbridge were flooded. The new Avebury Avenue flood defence will reduce the chance of this happening again. On 23 and 24 December 2013, up to 76mm of rain fell in 24 hours onto the sodden Medway catchment. The River Medway responded by rising significantly, coming out of bank at Avebury Avenue. The new defence at the rear of the Avebury Avenue flats has restored the ground height and will reduce the risk of flooding from the river to homes in the area. The 320-metre long flood defence runs parallel to the River Medway, and will work in conjunction with existing flood defence walls in Tonbridge town centre and the Leigh Flood Storage Area. Lisa Lennox, Asset Performance Team Leader for the Medway and North Kent said: We wanted to ensure that the new defence structure suited its surroundings whilst still providing a suitable level of protection, so the structure is subtle and in keeping with the modern flats of Avebury Avenue. Since Tonbridge was flooded in 2013 we have done a lot of work to make communities more resilient to the risk of flooding, and I would encourage local residents to check their flood risk , make a flood plan , and sign up to our free Flood Warning Service by visiting GOV.UK or calling 0345 988 1188. Although the new defence will reduce the likelihood of flooding, flood risk can never be completely eliminated and the Environment Agency has been working with Kent County Council and Kent Fire and Rescue Service to train Community Flood Wardens to work with communities and emergency services before, during and after a flood event. Carl Lewis, one of the Flood Wardens for Tonbridge said: Tonbridge Flood Warden Team are local volunteers committed to the safety and security of the people in at risk areas of the town and liaise closely with the Environment Agency and other agencies. Flood Wardens are vital to helping communities survive the effects of flooding."

Environment Agency drop-in to discuss Slaughden flood defence work  Environment Agency The work will take place in front of the seawall at Slaughden beach and will extend the existing protection from the Martello Tower to near Aldeburgh Yacht Club. A temporary footpath closure will be in place for public safety, but the Environment Agency will keep the footpath open wherever possible. The Environment Agency will be constructing approximately 200m of rock footings to protect the main defence at Slaughden. Rock will be delivered by sea and placed in front of the seawall before reinstating the beach with shingle. In recent years the beach levels at Slaughden have lowered significantly and have not naturally recovered. This has exposed the footings of the seawall, known as the toe, making it vulnerable to failure. David Kemp, Coastal Team Leader at the Environment Agency said: Maintaining the flood defence at Slaughden is important for the whole estuary. Rock toe protection will absorb the impact of strong waves which will reduce the risk of any breaches to the seawall. This will allow us to continue managing flood risk to the Alde/Ore estuary. Earlier this month the Environment Agency carried out emergency repairs in Slaughden and Bawdsey after wave action from strong south-easterly winds damaged the defences. The drop-in will be held on Thursday 21 January, from 2pm to 6pm at Aldeburgh Parish Church Hall, Victoria Road, IP15 5DU.

Alternatively, you can attend one of our local public events in January, as detailed below. The proposed Oxford Flood Alleviation Scheme will reduce the risk of flooding to over 1,000 properties. Tuesday 19 January marks the start of a 6-week public consultation. 5 drop-in events will be held across Oxford to give local communities the opportunity to have their say on the future of the flood risk in Oxford. These events also offer local communities, residents and businesses the opportunity to talk to the project team and to feed in local expertise and ideas for managing different aspects of the scheme, such as arrangements for construction and how to remove and re-use waste material from the site. Attendees can also indicate their preferred options for the route of a new flood relief channel. These events will provide an update on the work the Oxford Flood Alleviation Scheme project team have been doing since the last public events were held in summer 2015. Working with our partners including Oxfordshire County Council, Oxford City Council, Vale of White Horse District Council and Oxfordshire Local Enterprise Partnership, the Environment Agency has been using the wealth of information and ideas gathered from the last public events along with recent ground investigations to help develop options for the route of a flood relief channel. Joanna Larmour, Project Director for the Environment Agency, said: Our first round of events in summer 2015 were a great success. These events are an exciting opportunity for you to influence the work we are doing in your community on the flood alleviation scheme, and I look forward to hearing your views. I hope that many of you can make it, as the more local input we have, the better the scheme will be. I look forward to seeing you there. Councillor Rodney Rose, Deputy Leader for Oxfordshire County Council added: Plans for the flood alleviation scheme are progressing well, and now is a good time to share all the work that has been done as part of the Oxford Flood Alleviation Scheme project since the last public events were held last summer. As the lead local flood authority, Oxfordshire County Council strongly supports the Oxford Flood Alleviation Scheme and we encourage local communities, residents and businesses to take this opportunity to get involved in influencing the development of the scheme and have their say on the different options for the route of a new flood relief channel. Councillor Matthew Barber, Leader of Vale of White Horse District Council, said: The flood alleviation scheme is our best opportunity of ensuring that we are able to prevent the River Thames from flooding in the Vale, and it’s very clear that we need a solution in place sooner rather than later. I urge residents to come along to the public events, they are a great opportunity to find out how they could be affected by the scheme and to give their feedback on options for a relief channel.

You said, we listened – feedback from consultation informs plans for Black Sluice catchment  Environment Agency The Environment Agency has outlined the next steps for managing future flood risk in the Black Sluice catchment, after reviewing feedback from the community, local authorities and partner organisations. More than 70 responses were received in a six-week consultation seeking views on a number of options for the catchment as a whole – which includes Swaton, Billingborough and the South Forty Foot Drain where water flows into the Witham Haven – and for the future of Black Sluice pumping station in Boston. A document summarising the results of the consultation – and what happens next – has now been published online. The main findings show: Most people support the transfer of Black Sluice pumping station to the Black Sluice Internal Drainage Board; In the lower catchment, most people support protecting low points along the raised embankments from overtopping and erosion; and In the upper catchment, most people support increased channel maintenance downstream of villages, closely followed by ‘slowing the flow’ upstream to hold water back. In response, the Agency will submit a business case this spring to start carrying out works supported by the consultation that can attract full government funding, including applying for £2m to protect the low points in embankments from erosion. Additionally, a steering group led by an independent chairman has been formed to coordinate dialogue between the partners involved. The EA and the IDB will work together on the transfer of the Black Sluice pumping station to the IDB and begin work on erosion-protection and ‘slowing the flow’ schemes. Over the next two years, opportunities for longer-term funding will be investigated to enable the IDB to operate and maintain the pumping station in future. A plan will also be jointly created to maintain and operate other flood defences in the catchment, ensuring funding is used to the greatest benefit. Deborah Campbell, Environment Agency Flood and Coastal Risk Manager, said: “We’d like to thank everyone who took the time to get in touch with us about what they’d like to see happen in the Black Sluice catchment. Now we’re taking steps to explore how these options can be funded. “We’re pleased to be working closely with Black Sluice IDB on the transfer of the pumping station in accordance with what the local community has voiced. Meanwhile, through routine maintenance and schemes to strengthen the banks and ‘slow the flow’ of water upstream of villages like Swaton, we’ll continue to reduce flood risk from the river even further to properties across the whole catchment.” Ian Warsap, Chief Executive of Black Sluice Internal Drainage Board, said: “Black Sluice pumping station plays a pivotal role in reducing flood risk to an approximately 160,000-acre catchment and we welcome the opportunity to maintain and operate it along with the current main river assets within our catchments. “We will now investigate with our partners a way forward to attract the finance required to assist the Board in managing and controlling all our fluvial assets to help safeguard homes, businesses, land, buildings and infrastructure – all in tandem with an evolving environment.” Lincolnshire County Councillor Colin Davie, executive member for the environment and economy, said: “This has been an effective consultation process with the Environment Agency listening to the concerns raised by many respondents, including Lincolnshire County Council. Black Sluice pumping station plays an important role in the catchment and the outcome of this consultation will provide time for the effective handover of responsibility for managing the pumping station to the Black Sluice IDB.” The summary of consultation feedback and the Environment Agency’s response can be viewed on the gov.uk website ."

This month, silt will be removed from culverts at Chapel Beck in Guisborough, Cocker Beck in Darlington, and Loftus Beck in Loftus. Environment Agency contractors will remove blockages and a build up of silt deposits, increasing the capacity of the culverts and reducing the risk of flooding. The work started on January 18 and will be complete by the end of February. In addition, further culvert cleaning and repairs to culverts will be carried out at: Dene Beck, South Church, Durham Woodlea, Forest Hall, North Tyneside Alnmouth Terrace, Acomb, Northumberland Smallhope Burn, Lanchester, Durham West Beck, West Auckland, Darlington This will start in February and be completed during April. Silt enters rivers carried by run-off from fields and roads. The Environment Agency’s Steve Wilkinson said: The build-up of silt in culverts reduces the capacity for water to pass through, particularly when it’s needed most during a flood. This in turn can raise water levels further upstream which can lead to flooding. As well as clearing silt, the work will see lodged debris in the culverts, such as logs and tyres, removed. This will reduce the risk of flooding to nearby homes and businesses. The work, which is costing around £475,000, has been pre-planned since last year and will be completed in April."
/government/news/flood-advice-for-skipton-and-glusburn,"Residents urged to sign up for free flood warnings Flood advice for Skipton and Glusburn  Environment Agency Residents and business owners in Skipton and Glusburn will be offered advice over the next few weeks on how to prepare for floods. The Environment Agency is targeting properties in areas at risk of flooding along Eller Beck and Waller Beck in Skipton, as well as Eastburn Beck (Holme Beck) in Glusburn. Over 1,600 properties in Skipton and around 640 in Glusburn are at risk from the local becks, while many other properties can be affected by flooding from other sources, such as surface water. As we have seen across the north of England this winter, flooding can be extremely dangerous and have devastating effects on communities. Graham Lindsay, Environment Agency Flood Resilience Advisor said: While we continue our work to tackle flooding problems, including delivering the Skipton Flood Alleviation Scheme, we also want residents and businesses to be pro-active in thinking about the risks posed by flooding and how they can take steps to be prepared. Where possible we will use our free flood warning system to alert people and keep people updated if we think flooding from the local rivers is possible. Currently, however, only about a quarter of residents and businesses in Skipton and Glusburn who are eligible for this service, have opted to register their details. There’s a real danger, therefore, that if there was a major flood affecting these communities, we would not be able to effectively warn people in advance. That’s why we are working hard to make sure people do register, understand what a flood alert or a flood warning means, and have considered what other action they can take now, in order to be prepared. Staff working on behalf of the Environment Agency will be visiting properties in Skipton and Glusburn from 9 February onwards in order to offer information and advice, including knowing the dangers of fast moving flood water, knowing how to stay safe and how to be as prepared as possible. Many of the streams and becks in Pennine areas, such as Eller Beck in Skipton and Holme Beck in Glusburn, can rise very quickly in response to heavy rainfall, particularly when the ground is saturated. It only takes around 15cm (6 inches) of fast moving water to sweep someone off their feet, and around 60cm (2 feet) to float a car, so it’s essential that people know the signs that flash flooding could occur and do not put themselves at risk. The Environment Agency has recently started work to improve flood defences in parts of Skipton town centre. Four sites in the town centre have been targeted for improvements as part of the £13 million scheme, and two flood storage areas are also being constructed outside the town. Staff will be available to provide further updates and to address any questions or concerns raised by local residents and business owners, at Skipton Town Hall every Friday from 10am to 3pm during February and March. To find out whether you could be at risk of flooding, to register for the free flood warning service, or for information on how to prepare for flooding, visit our flood advice pages or call Floodline 0345 988 1188."
/government/news/environmental-improvement-work-will-benefit-peterborough,"Work programme will improve water quality and create better habitats Environmental improvement work will benefit Peterborough  Environment Agency Wildlife, water and communities are set to benefit from improvements to the environment starting this week in Peterborough, led by the Environment Agency. The Werrington Brook Improvements programme, starting with a 417-metre stretch of Marholm Brook, near Lincoln road, will see work take place to improve water quality and create better habitats. The five-year partnership between the Environment Agency, Peterborough City Council and the charity Peterborough Environment City Trust will include work to replicate the way a natural stream flows. At the moment, during dry periods, the area suffers from shallow water, low flows and lacks important dissolved oxygen which is needed for healthy habitats and wildlife. The work will include increasing the number of meanders, re-shaping banks, creating a small wetland, and introducing several natural river features like riffles, berms and pools. These will all work together to create natural processes that, in turn, will help clean the water, create better wildlife habitat and keep the stream healthy. Rob Price, Catchment Coordinator at the Environment Agency, said: The Werrington Brook Improvements programme will create an even better environment for people and wildlife, bringing additional social, well-being and economic benefits to the area. Healthy rivers and habitats encourage a cleaner environment which results in a more diverse and healthier wildlife, making green spaces even more attractive for all to enjoy. In turn, people make the most of them, like taking more walks, exploring and enjoying their surroundings which helps improve health and well-being. The works follow a public consultation held last winter and form part of a wider programme to deal with pollution and encourage communities and businesses to engage closer with the water environment. Further improvements are planned for eight more stretches of water between Marholm village and Cuckoo’s Hollow Lake – which Peterborough City Council is currently carrying out large scale maintenance to remove some of the reeds and reduce silt in the lake to improve water flow. This work will help improve and keep the national water quality environment standards of the streams in this area. The success of the improvements will be closely monitored and used to help plan further developments in Peterborough and elsewhere in the country. The programme is part funded by Environment Agency and Peterbrough City Council who aim to attract other partners to help deliver the work."

Fishing for elvers is allowed in England and Wales, but under strict conditions to ensure stocks are not over-exploited. The elver season runs from 15 February to 25 May 2016 inclusive and is largely limited to the Rivers Parrett and Tone. There are approximately 200 licenced elver fishermen in Somerset who must register with the Environment Agency at the start of the season. Buy your fishing rod licence . Sustainable fishing includes the capture of elvers for restocking in countries across Northern Europe where eel stocks have declined and cannot be replenished naturally. All elver fishing in Somerset is done with hand held nets known as ‘dip nets’. They are restricted in size to 1 metre long, 0.8m wide and 0.45m deep. Handle lengths should be no longer than 3 metres. Fishing from boats is prohibited and no other large nets or traps are allowed. As a further precaution, all nets must be tagged and fishermen need to carry photographic ID with them. To protect stocks, no fishing is permitted within 10 metres of any river obstruction, dam, inlet, outlet or fish pass that hinders the passage of elvers. A full list of rules can be found in the elver fishing bylaws . Richard Deamley for the Environment Agency said: We recognise the majority of elver fishermen operate responsibly and respect the law. We work closely with the police in detecting illegal fishing and, where we have evidence, won’t hesitate to prosecute offenders. Call 0800 555 111 to report information on environmental crime anonymously. Any illegal or suspicious activity can be reported to the Environment Agency or Crime Stoppers."

/government/news/repair-work-to-start-on-frankwell-flood-defence-in-shrewsbury,"On Monday 22 February, the Environment Agency will begin repair work on a section of the Frankwell flood defence scheme in Shrewsbury.  Repair work to start on Frankwell flood defence in Shrewsbury  Environment Agency The repairs will involve relaying part of the outer brick wall cladding and installation of a new coping stone along a 170m section of wall adjacent to the Bowling Green. The works, which are expected to take approximately 2 weeks, will ensure that the wall does not pose a health and safety risk to members of the public using the area. There is no change to the standard of protection offered by the flood defence and the repairs taking place are mainly for aesthetic and public safety purposes. Heavy rainfall is forecast this coming weekend which may result in rising river levels along the River Severn in Shrewsbury. In the event that the demountable flood barriers at Frankwell are required, the repair works will not affect any aspect of the deployment and the flood defence will still continue to perform normally and effectively at times of flood. Shropshire Council has offered the Environment Agency free use of Frankwell Main Long Stay car park for the duration of the works for those people directly impacted by the works. Shrewsbury Town Council has also allowed the use of their land for Environment Agency site works. Toby Whitehouse from the Environment Agency said: “The outer layer of our flood defence takes the majority of the wear and tear over time. Even though this outer layer does not provide the flood protection, we want to make sure it is in keeping with the surrounding area and is in a good, safe condition for members of the public using the area.” “We are really pleased that Shropshire Council and Shrewsbury Town Council have provided free use of their car park and land during the works. It is great that we can work together to achieve more for those living in and visiting Frankwell. Simon Jones, Shropshire Council’s Cabinet member said: “I’m delighted that we have been able to help our colleagues at the Environment Agency by providing free parking for those affected while this essential repair work is carried out. The money that the Environment Agency would have otherwise spent on parking can now be put into the repair work, and ensure that additional and more comprehensive work can now be carried out. This means that a longer stretch of wall can now be treated, and that this stretch of wall will be even more secure and much safer, and for much longer.” Mike Cox from Shrewsbury Town Council said: “Shrewsbury Town Council looks forward to working in partnership with all agencies to ensure the works are completed as quickly as possible and that any inconvenience to our customers and visitors to the town is kept to a minimum.” The Frankwell flood alleviation scheme reduces the risk of flooding from the River Severn. The scheme consists of a series of permanent flood walls (700m) and demountable slats (155m) along the north bank of the Severn as it flows to the north of Shrewsbury Town Centre."

Public invited to review new Faversham flood defence scheme proposal  Environment Agency The Environment Agency is proposing to build a new flood defence embankment along Faversham Creek to defend properties at Front Brents. The defence will be a grassed embankment approximately 80 centimetres in height. A series of flood gates in the embankment, which will be closed during a flood, will still allow access to the green and creek area. The scheme will cost approximately £100,000 and has been developed in partnership with Swale Borough Council. Residents of Front Brents have also contributed financially to the project as have Faversham Town Council and Kent County Council. As part of the construction of the new flood defence, the Environment Agency has the opportunity to include improvements to the creekside area for the local community. The Environment Agency is providing an unmanned public display at Faversham Library from 19 February to 25 February 2016 and is inviting the local community to view the plans and give their feedback. Simon Curd, Flood Risk Team Leader, said: We would encourage the public to attend the consultation event and provide us with their opinions and what enhancements they think we can include and introduce as part of the scheme. This is a great opportunity to increase enjoyment of the creekside area and to reduce flood risk to the community. Construction is proposed to start in the early summer of 2016.

New digital road signs warn of flooding along North Norfolk coast  Environment Agency The Environment Agency has been working with the Borough Council of King’s Lynn and West Norfolk and the Norfolk Local Resilience Forum to improve how we warn and inform the public of tidal flooding. The new LED signs will be brighter, more visible to motorists and provide timely information to residents and visitors. They replace 4 manually updated signs that were installed in 2005. The signs will be illuminated when tidal flood alerts and flood warnings are issued, and provide information on high water time and when evacuation is necessary. These signs complement the Environment Agency’s existing free flood warning service that anyone can register for. Sadia Moeed, Operations Manager of the Environment Agency, said: The new signs are a great addition to our flood warning service and how we warn and inform members of the public to potential tidal flooding. The up to date information and improved visibility is a great benefit for the local community and visitors to the area who may not be aware of the flood risk. You can check to see if you are at risk of flooding or to register for the flood warning service visit www.gov.uk/flood or call Floodline Warnings Direct on 0345 988 1188.

Details of the Environment Agency scheme, which is jointly funded with Highways England and North Yorkshire County Council, will be outlined at a public drop-in meeting at the Booth Memorial Hall, Catterick, on Monday 7 March from 3pm to 5.30pm when members of the project team will be on hand to provide information and address any questions or concerns. The new storage reservoir will be built upstream of Catterick, between Brough Park and the A1 motorway, and will be able to hold 91 million gallons of water which, in a storm event, would overwhelm Brough Beck, putting the village and surrounding area at risk of flooding. Environment Agency contractors will start work on the project in Spring 2016 and it will take about a year to complete. The flood storage area will provide a significantly improved standard of flood protection for 149 homes and businesses as well as protecting the A1 motorway. In addition, a local bridleway will be improved and a new area of wildlife habitat will be created along Brough Beck. Environment Agency Project Manager, Philip Boyes, said: We have been working closely in partnership with Highways England and North Yorkshire County Council to develop this scheme and their support has been vital in enabling us to secure the necessary funding so the work can to go ahead. When completed, the storage reservoir will hold flood water back so it flows more slowly down Brough Beck towards Catterick village and the new section of the A1 which is currently under construction. This will significantly reduce flood risk in the area. Mr Boyes added that all construction traffic would access the site from the A1 and the recently completed Catterick Central junction, thereby avoiding the need for heavy lorries to pass through the village."
/government/news/removal-of-collapsed-building-in-mytholmroyd-overwhelmed-in-boxing-day-floods,"Work will take up to two weeks to complete Removal of collapsed building in Mytholmroyd overwhelmed in Boxing Day floods  Environment Agency Work to remove the collapsed section of the Whitesands building on Burnley Road, Mytholmroyd, starts on Tuesday 1 March. The building, formerly Whitesands Travel Agents, was overwhelmed during the Boxing Day floods, spilling rubble and building debris into the River Calder. In order to remove this risk and improve the appearance of the site, Environment Agency contractors will be on site to demolish what’s left of the building and clear the debris from the river channel. Andrew Coen, project manager at Environment Agency, said: We’ve been working closely with Calderdale Council to ensure the safe removal of what’s left of the building and the debris that’s spilled into the river channel. Because of the unstable nature of the building, it’s necessary that a corden is placed around the site and temporary traffic lights are put up on Burnley Road. We expect the work to take up to two weeks. Drivers are advised to expect some delays, but the lights will be monitored to ensure disruption is kept to a minimum. Cllr Barry Collins, Calderdale Council’s Cabinet Member for Regeneration and Economic Development, said: We are aware that the damage to the building is very visible, so we are keen to support the Environment Agency to ensure the safety of the site and improve its appearance for local people and visitors. We have continued to monitor the stability of the site since the floods, and looking to the future, plans are being considered with the owners of the premises to secure the river edge and redevelop the site of the single storey buildings in the same row as the former Whitesands building. The Environment Agency is carrying out an extensive programme of work right across Yorkshire to inspect and repair defences damaged in the December floods. This work also includes identifying the potential for flood risks caused by damage to structures such as the Whitesands building. To date 7,000 inspections have been carried out."

/government/news/annual-beach-recycling-underway-in-norfolk--2,"Environment Agency contractors start work on 7 March 2016 maintaining the shingle embankment and beach between Snettisham and Hunstanton.  Annual beach recycling underway in Norfolk  Environment Agency Environment Agency contractors will start work on 7 March 2016 on annual maintenance of the shingle embankment and beach which helps protect people and 2,935 properties from tidal flooding between Snettisham and Hunstanton. The work is expected to take 3 weeks. The embankment is a ‘soft’ sea defence, which requires annual maintenance to repair any damage or loss of material sustained over the winter period. Ryan Ely, Environment Agency Flood and Coastal Risk Advisor, said: We will be moving around 5,000 cubic metres of sand and shingle from the Snettisham Scalp to reinforce the defences between Snettisham and Hunstanton South. This process is known as beach recycling and is the most sustainable way to protect the coast in this location. The work is being carried out before the start of the bird breeding season and will be completed before the start of the main tourist season. The cost of the project is likely to be around £150,000. Dumpers will move sand and shingle from Snettisham Scalp, where it is naturally deposited by the sea over the winter, back to areas of the shingle ridge and beach that have lost material. It is then shaped by bulldozers to ensure the width, height and profile of the shingle ridge and beach is reinstated so that the ridge continues to protect the coastal community from flooding. The Environment Agency monitors beach levels throughout the year to determine how much material will need to be taken from Snettisham Scalp and where it will need to be placed. The project is carried out in consultation with Natural England and the RSPB due to the environmental importance of this coastline. The Environment Agency carries out ecological monitoring to ensure there is no long term detrimental effect on the ecology of the area. Next year the works will be funded through a new Partnership Funding initiative, a key recommendation of the Wash East Coastal Management Strategy (developed by the Environment Agency and the Borough Council of Kings Lynn & West Norfolk) which was published last summer. The East Wash Coastal Management Community Interest Company was set up to raise funds from the local community, caravan park owners and local landowners, to help protect this coastline for future years. Cllr Brian Long, borough council cabinet member for Environment, said: Beach recycling is vital work that must be done to protect West Norfolk’s coastline, but the way it’s funded has changed. 2016 is the last year we can rely wholly on government funding, but we’ve worked hard to prepare for the future. Funds raised by the East Wash Coastal Management Community Interest Company, contributions from other partners and a central government grant in aid will ensure that the 2017 beach recycling works can go ahead. However, we will need to keep working with the CIC and our partners to raise money to ensure the work continues beyond 2017. More information is available by contacting the Environment Agency’s Customer Services line on 03708 506 506. Notices will be put up along the flood banks to make people using the beach aware of the works. Notes for editors We will be inviting media along to Snettisham Beach on 18 March to see the work taking place and to hear about the plans to ensure the annual maintenance of the shingle embankment and beach will continue in the future. Invitations will be sent out once arrangements have been finalised. Media enquiries 9am to 5pm: 0800 917 9261"
/government/news/3-million-flood-defences-boost-protection-in-north-east,"A multi-million pound scheme to reduce the risk of flooding to 350 homes and 32 businesses in Teesside is complete.  £3 million flood defences boost protection in North East  Environment Agency The Environment Agency joined forces with local business Wilton Engineering to deliver the Port Clarence flood alleviation scheme. Wilton has manufactured a removable section of defence, which protects their work site and the local community from flooding, but ensures they can still operate from the river. This week the Environment Agency attended High Clarence Primary School to talk to pupils about flooding, the new defences and how the scheme protects where they live and the surrounding local businesses. The Environment Agency’s Operations Manager for the North East, Alan Cadas, said: This has been a really innovative collaboration between ourselves and Wilton Engineering – seeing us work together with industry to protect the local area. The removable defence means homes and businesses in Port Clarence are protected from flooding, but they also ensure Wilton can still operate its business from the river when required. The scheme has also seen a mixture of embankments, flood walls and ground raising along the River Tees to reduce the risk of flooding. I remember well the impact of the most recent floods on the local community and I hope the completion of this scheme provides reassurance for residents going into the future as well as protecting local industry. The sections of removable defence joins with a concrete flood wall which runs along the rest of the front of Wilton’s site. In total the length of the new defences measures almost 1.5km. There’s been 132 precast concrete units used weighing nearly six tonnes each. And 47 bespoke removable sections of steel defence, each six metres long and weighing 1.2 tonnes each have been lifted into place. There are also new flood embankments to the east and west of Wilton, and a 35-metre section of the road on the approach to the Transporter Bridge has been raised by around half a metre. Construction started on site in March 2015 and was completed in December. Wilton Engineering Chief Executive Bill Scott added: Flooding is a huge problem throughout many parts of the UK. I am sure the residents of Port Clarence will be able to sleep knowing that they are now protected against similar flooding events to that which occurred during the tidal surge back in December 2013. It is testament to the Environment Agency to proceed so quickly to install a large bespoke flood defence system to protect the local community, and businesses. Wilton Engineering was very keen to work in partnership with the Environment Agency from day one to ensure that the scheme could go ahead utilising collaboration to great effect. Indeed we will continue to work with the Environment Agency to ensure the flood defence scheme is maintained and therefore robust for many years. Jon Hargreaves, Chairman of the Northumbria Regional Flood and Coastal Committee said: I’m delighted the Port Clarence scheme is complete, bringing much needed protection for the community, as well as industry in the area. The Environment Agency has worked closely with Stockton-on-Tees Borough Council during the scheme. The most recent impact of flooding in Port Clarence was seen in December 2013, when a tidal surge combined with high spring tides affected around 50 homes and businesses. Across England, the Environment Agency’s flood schemes have protected an extra 182,000 properties in the past three years – and it’s spending £2.3 billion over the next six years to reduce flood risk to a further 300,000 more properties.

/government/news/thames-water-fined-380000-for-pollution-of-a-rural-stream,"Thames Water fined £380,000 at Aylesbury Crown Court for polluting the Horsenden Stream in Buckinghamshire.   Thames Water fined £380,000 for pollution of a rural stream  Environment Agency The case was brought by the Environment Agency after Thames Water caused pollution from their site at Princes Risborough sewage treatment works (STW) to enter Horsenden Stream - part of the River Thame catchment area in the Chilterns, which is an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Thames Water pleaded guilty at Wycombe Magistrates Court on 5 August 2015 and was committed to Aylesbury Crown Court for sentence. On Monday 7 March 2016 the company was also ordered to pay costs of £23,092.64 and a victim surcharge of £120. The ongoing management failures at a site the court described as clapped out were lamentable and caused the company to breach the site permit on a number of occasions between February and July 2013. The court heard how in February 2013 an officer conducting an unrelated fisheries survey of the stream had to stop for his own welfare because of the level of sewage in the stream. The Recorder of Aylesbury, His Honour Judge Sheridan, noted that if it wasn’t for the fisheries survey the incidents were unlikely to have come to light due to the unacceptable level of management failures at the site. A further discharge was seen by officers during a site visit on 5 March 2013 when the sewage in the stream looked like feathers in places, and again on 19 July 2013, the latter being caused by a blockage in the works. Princess Risborough STW is operated by Thames Water. Sewage requires treatment before it can be discharged into a receiving watercourse because it includes human waste, a variety of poIlutants, organic materials and chemicals. The conditions of the environmental permit set by the Environment Agency aim to prevent pollution of the stream. The permit also allows Thames Water to discharge sewage during storm conditions as long as stringent conditions are met. Between February and July 2013 the site was poorly managed and there were ongoing problems. Storm discharges into the stream were either observed or recorded in the log book on 21 occasions. The inlet screens, designed to prevent debris from entering the works and causing blockages, were not working and the storm tank pump was broken. The site’s storm weir was also set too low which meant that discharges were happening when the effluent should have been passing through the works for treatment. Environment Officer, Holly Linham said: Our officers attended the site where they walked the Horsenden Stream and saw thick layers of sewage fungus carpeting the river bed and plants. One of the officers had never seen sewage fungus in a stream that bad before. A biological survey of the stream noted that the impact of the sewage was chronic and was likely to have been prevalent for some time. The conditions observed by Environment Agency officers during their visits were not isolated incidents. Log book entries suggest ongoing discharges and other problems at a site that was struggling to cope. We take these types of incidents very seriously and will do everything within our powers to safeguard the environment and people that maybe affected, and that includes holding those who put the environment at risk to account for their actions. In sentencing the court gave Thames Water full credit for its early plea. The company has since changed the management structure at the site and raised the storm weir. As a result the stream has improved. The court placed on record the company’s commitment to improving its environmental performance and noted that it could face significantly higher fines in future if it did not stay true to its word."

There are several locations where gravels have deposited in Hebden Water, a tributary of the River Calder, since the floods. This includes Old Gate, Waterside Fold and Innovation Weir. The Environment Agency has appointed a contractor to remove these gravels where they have built up, using a mini excavator, to improve the flow of the river. Gravel clearance has already been completed near Morrisons on Walsden Water, Callis Bridge, Colden Clough and all of the silt traps between Cornholme and Todmorden. Andrew Coen, project manager at the Environment Agency said: This work is necessary to remove the large quantities of gravel from the Boxing Day flood that’s been deposited in the channel. This clearance work will return the channel back to the condition it was in before the floods and ensure the standard of flood protection in Hebden Bridge will be maintained. Teams are also at Luddenden Foot removing gravel and debris from around the canal aqueduct over the river. The Environment Agency last week finished the demolition of a collapsed section of the former Whitesands Travel building in Mytholmroyd. Once the building was demolished, it became evident that there was risk of further scour to the channel wall underneath the building, so this has now been shored with sandbags to prevent any further damage, until a more permanent solution is developed. The Environment Agency would like to apologise for any inconvenience caused by the traffic management that was in place throughout the duration of this works."

/government/news/100000-hangover-for-brewery-after-water-pollution-incident,"Molson Coors Brewery (UK) Limited (MCB Ltd) have been fined £100,000 and ordered to pay costs of £31,586.49 at Basingstoke Magistrates Court for polluting the River Wey. £100,000 hangover for brewery after water pollution incident  Environment Agency In a case brought by the Environment Agency, MCB Ltd were in court on 17 March 2016 for polluting the River Wey and the Lasham Drain (which carries surface water runoff and is a tributary of the River Wey). MCB Ltd pleaded guilty to 2 offences: causing a water discharge activity and breaching the condition of its environmental permit with respect to monitoring the Lasham Drain for fungus. The offences resulted in the discharge of process trade effluent from the installation activities at their premises at Alton Brewery, Lower Turk Street, Manor Park, Alton, Hampshire into the Lasham Drain and causing pollution which went undetected. The court heard that there had been gutters on the building known as the “boiler room” located next to a trade effluent chamber that ran directly to the Lasham Drain. The gutters had been removed when the building had been extended and the chamber was converted from a storm water drain to a trade waste effluent drain from this section of the building. When the alterations were made the contractors had used a liner which did not seal the chamber to divert the trade effluent, resulting in not completely blocking the existing pipe and pathway to the Lasham Drain. The Environment Agency first received reports of the presence of fungus in the stream flowing outside Waterside Court Alton, before flowing along the River Wey towards Holybourne. An Environment Agency officer checked the watercourse and confirmed that a lot of fungus was present in Waterside Court. Environment Officers traced the pollution to MCB Ltd premises where a discharge of trade effluent was seen to be entering the Lasham Drain culvert within the brewery. The effluent was discovered to be flowing into the Lasham Drain culvert through the cracks and defects in the chamber. The company had also failed to respond to the regular monitoring and visual inspections that they were obliged to carry out as a requirement of their permit issued by the Environment Agency. This monitoring clearly indicated that there was a serious problem in the Lasham Drain but MCB Ltd failed to act upon this information. The drainage problems at MCB Ltd which caused the pollution led to a significant reduction in the water’s biological quality at Lasham Drain and downstream in the Wey North, compared with that of the upstream control site. The presence of large quantities of sewage fungus indicated that very high nutrient organic matter was entering the Lasham Drain. Paul Greaves, Senior Environment Agency officer said: We take these types of incidents very seriously and will do everything within our powers to safeguard the environment and people affected, and that includes bringing those who harm the environment to account for their actions. It is important that the courts send out a clear message to all companies operating in this sector. Regulations are there to protect the environment and that the courts will act firmly where regulations are breached and where the environment is either damaged or put at risk of damage."
/government/news/totnes-flood-defences-public-drop-in-session,"The Environment Agency is holding a public drop-in on Saturday 16 April 2016 to provide more information about how they plan to reduce flood risk by upgrading defences in Totnes.       Totnes flood defences: public drop-in session  Environment Agency The drop-in will be open from 11am until 7pm at: The Civic Hall High Street Totnes Devon TQ9 5SF The Environment Agency wants to share ideas with people who live and work in Totnes. They are keen to get as much feedback as possible before they submit designs for planning permission. Dan Boswell, project manager for the Environment Agency, said: We really want to see and hear from as many people as possible at the drop-in, as this will give us a really good idea of what people think of our designs before we submit them for planning. By using the existing flood defences the Environment Agency hope to be able to carry out the improvements in a cost effective way which minimises disruption in the town during construction. Dan Boswell added: The existing defences give us a great starting point as we don’t need to come in and start from scratch which will mean our work should be less disruptive. The improvements will most likely include raising the existing walls and installing gates across existing slip ways. There may be a need for individual property protection in some locations. To see all these things in more detail, local residents are being encouraged to attend the drop-in at the Civic Hall. The Environment Agency has already been out in Totnes speaking to some of the residents who live closest to the river. Tom Buxton-Smith, an engineer with the Environment Agency, said: We are pleased that most people we have spoken to have been supportive of improving the flood defences. It has been really useful hearing what people have to say. The excellent local knowledge that some of the residents have shared with us will really help us develop our designs. Those who are unable to attend the drop-in at the Civic Hall can read the latest on the project . Note to editors The project to improve the flood defences in Totnes is separate from the planned work at Steamer Quay to repair the existing flood wall. It is hoped that this work will be completed later in the year."

/government/news/slowing-the-flow-scheme-helped-avoid-christmas-flooding,"A pioneering natural flood risk management scheme reduced river peak flow by around 15-20% during the December floods, a briefing note published today (13 April) reveals. Slowing the Flow scheme helped avoid Christmas flooding  Environment Agency The natural flood risk management scheme provided important protection for the town of Pickering in Yorkshire when a total of 50 mm of rainfall fell over a 36-hour period over Christmas 2015. Pickering’s ‘Slowing the Flow’ partnership was set up after the town saw four serious floods in 10 years, with floods in 2007 estimated to have caused damage of around £7 million. The scheme combines conventional upstream flood storage with a wide range of measures designed to work with nature to hold water on the land and slow the speed at which it enters the river system. In addition to the construction of a flood storage reservoir: 40,000 trees were planted, local heather moorland restored and over 300 leaky dams built in forest and moorland drains and streams in the upper catchment. The new analysis, conducted by Slowing the Flow Partnership, concludes that these measures reduced the flow of flood water between 15% and 20% and prevented the flooding of a number homes and the town’s museum. Based on the extent of inflows to the flood storage area, it is estimated that around half of the reduction was due to the upstream land management measures and half due to the flood storage area The investigation involved: Quantifying the volume of rain that fell during the Boxing Day event by analysing the records from local rain gauges Determining if the amount of rainfall was sufficient to generate a flood by comparing this with other events in previous years John Curtin, Environment Agency Executive Director of Flood Risk Management, said: Natural flood risk management measures when used alongside more traditional flood defences can make an effective contribution to reducing flood risk, as demonstrated in Pickering. They can also deliver more benefits than just reducing flood risk – such as improving water quality, preventing erosion and in some cases storing carbon. Jeremy Walker, ‘Slowing the Flow’ Partnership Chairman, said: We wanted to understand fully whether our efforts in recent years in trying to hold back and store water in the catchment prevented flooding in Pickering in the days after Christmas. This analysis by our hydrologists confirms that some flooding was avoided, although the measures were not fully tested. The key finding for us is that they appear to be working as expected and reducing the peak flood flow by up to 20%. This is good news for the town, although we need to remember that the measures installed have their limits and would not be enough to prevent flooding in the event of rainfall on the scale experienced for example in 2007."
/government/news/waste-firm-ordered-to-pay-more-than-12m-for-waste-offences,"A London waste company has been ordered to pay more than £1.2m after pleading guilty to historical waste offences at Harrow Crown Court. Waste firm ordered to pay more than £1.2m for waste offences  Environment Agency Powerday Plc, 1 of London and South East England’s biggest waste companies, was sentenced for offences relating to historical operations in relation to 2 separate cases, which saw more than 17,000 tonnes of waste deposited and stored illegally. Fines were imposed amounting to £1 million and the company agreed to pay the Environment Agency’s costs of £243,955.35 for the investigation and prosecution of the offences. The first case was for a number of offences involving the receipt and storage of large quantities of hazardous waste at the company’s main operating site at Willesden, London in 2010. The second case related to offences which occurred at a site operated by Aylesbury Mushroom Farms Ltd at Elmwood Farm, Black Bourton, Bampton, Oxfordshire in 2012 and involved the deposit of approximately 3,000 tonnes of non-hazardous trommel fines originating from the Willesden site. Powerday Plc had previously admitted its guilt to the offences in relation to both sites. The offences at the Willesden site involved approximately 14,500 tons of hazardous waste (including construction and demolition waste containing asbestos, contaminated concrete and treated wood) that was taken to the company’s Willesden transfer station from development sites in London and from a power station in Nottinghamshire. There had been a previous hearing at Harrow Crown Court during which the company had argued that it was legally entitled to store more than 10 tonnes of certain types of hazardous waste at the Willesden site in accordance with its interpretation of the permit. However, following legal argument, HHJ Barklem ruled in favour of the Environment Agency and found that the permit did not allow the company to store more than 10 tonnes of such hazardous wastes at any one time at its Willesden site. The Oxfordshire case had been transferred to Harrow Crown Court to be sentenced at the same time as the Willesden case. Powerday had previously agreed in court to remove at its own cost the 3,000 tons of waste deposited at Elmwood Farm, and this removal had been completed in 2015. The waste had been deposited with the permission of the operator of the farm, but not in accordance with any relevant environmental permit or registered exemption. Four other offenders, including the owner of the farm, had been previously sentenced for offences relating to the same operation at Oxford Crown Court (and in respect of 1 offender, at the local Magistrates’ Court). Counsel for the company informed the court that the cases were now several years in the past, that the company had corrected and improved its systems and procedures, and that it had now developed excellent working relations with the regulator, the Environment Agency. The company and its managing director had apologised to the court for the historic failures which had given rise to the offences. The Environment Agency takes tough action against illegal activity and will not hesitate to investigate and prosecute those involved in waste crime. Illegal waste activity undermines other legitimately run businesses and puts the public and environment at risk. The Environment Agency urges anyone who suspects illegal activity to report it on the environmental incident hotline or Crimestoppers. Notes to editors: • With the concurrence of Powerday Plc, through their counsel, the company was fined on Monday 11 April 2016 by HHJ Barklem as follows: In relation to the Willesden operation: £350,000 for failing to comply with its environmental permit between the 31st December 2009 and the 6th of April 2010 in that it stored more than 10 tonnes of hazardous waste at the Willesden site for disposal – contrary to the Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2007 (whereby that sum represented an agreed amount of financial benefit arising from the offences at the Willesden site). £350,000 for a similar offence with respect to the dates 6th April to 1st January 2011. £200,000 for treating, keeping or disposing of controlled waste in a manner likely to cause pollution or harm to human health – contrary to section 33(1)(c) of the Environmental Protection Act 1990. In addition, no separate penalty was imposed in respect of 1 admitted breach of the duty of care provisions under section 34 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 and 1 admitted breach of the Hazardous Waste Regulations 1990. In relation to the Aylesbury Mushroom Farm operation: £100,000 for the offence of depositing controlled waste at Elmwood Farm otherwise than in accordance with an environmental permit – contrary section 33(1)(a) of the Environmental Protection Act 1990. No separate penalty was imposed in respect of 1 admitted breach of the duty of care provisions under section 34 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990."
/government/news/leicester-born-environment-agency-chief-executive-visits-the-city,"Sir James Bevan, Chief Executive of the Environment Agency visited last week to see the innovative Leicester Flood Risk Management Scheme. Leicester born Environment Agency Chief Executive visits the city  Environment Agency Leicester born Sir James Bevan, the Environment Agency’s chief executive, visited the city last week (Friday, 15 April) to see the work being done to reduce flood risk across the area. The visit involved a tour of the Leicester Flood Risk Management Scheme, a joint project funded between the Environment Agency and Leicester City Council, which is now entering into the third phase of development. The £7 million scheme is split into 3 phases and will ultimately reduce flood risk to approximately 4,700 properties in the city of Leicester through a series of flow improvements along the River Soar. This 3-phase project is a key part of a wider programme of works being developed for Leicester (Leicester Flood Risk Management Strategy) with over £31 million earmarked for potential flood management schemes over the next few years. Leicester City Mayor, Sir Peter Soulsby and Assistant City Mayor, Councillor Adam Clarke also joined Sir James on the tour of the scheme. Following the visit, Sir James said, “One of the Environment Agency’s key roles is to reduce the risk of flooding to people and property, and my visit to see the Leicester Flood Risk Management Scheme provided me with the opportunity to see just how committed our local staff are to achieving that. “This innovative scheme is a great example of how through partnership working, flood risk can be reduced in an urban area to protect homes and businesses, whilst achieving benefits for the environment and locally community”. Leicester City Mayor Sir Peter Soulsby said: “The Environment Agency’s investment in Leicester is essential to the city’s flood prevention work. It also gives us the chance to improve our riverside areas and make them more attractive to visitors. “The River Soar is a wonderful riverside habitat, and by working with the Environment Agency we’re making the most of this natural asset as part of a major programme of work to tackle flood risks facing the city.” As part of the phase 2 developments, a new wetland habitat has been created at the former John Ellis playing fields site in the Abbey Meadows area. A launch day is going to be held in the summer to celebrate the completion of this area to give residents an opportunity to see the benefits of the scheme so far and to find out more information about what’s still to come. ENDS Background Information: Phase 1 was completed in December 2014 and involved increasing the river flow through the existing flood arches beneath the Great Central Way Biam Bridge by de-silting and making local channel improvements. This phase of the scheme reduced flooding to approximately 250 properties in Braunstone Town and Aylestone. Phase 2 which is near completion, began in spring 2015 and involved lowering public open spaces to increase the storage capacity of flood plain areas. This phase of the scheme will reduce flood risk to around 1,900 properties and will provide great benefits to people and the environment through the creation of a new wetland habitat at the former John Ellis playing fields site. The wetland habitat will not only attract new wildlife to the city centre but new pathways and cycle routes will provide people with better access across the city centre. Initial ground investigations have recently taken place as the start of the plans for phase 3 which will involve the construction of floodwater bypass culverts and channels at Loughborough Road and Thurcaston Road bridges to reduce floodwater levels upstream. The third phase will aim to reduce the risk of flooding to over 2,500 properties, particularly in the Belgrave and Abbey Meadows areas.

/government/news/environment-agency-launches-soil-speed-awareness-courses-for-land-management-offenders,"The Environment Agency has recently launched the first of a number of planned soil awareness courses in Herefordshire.  Environment Agency launches Soil “Speed” Awareness Courses for Land Management offenders  Environment Agency These take a similar approach to a driving speed awareness course and are aimed at Farmers and Land Managers where issues associated with soil run-off and water pollution have been identified. Farmers may also be referred to attend the course where breaches of the soil protection standards are identified under cross compliance, which could also mean a reduction in the basic farm payment. Depending on the severity of the issue the farmer or land manager will be offered the option of attending the course instead of immediate enforcement action by the Environment Agency. In Herefordshire there are significant issues with soil erosion from agriculture which is impacting on the quality of the water in the River Wye and Lugg, which is also a special area of conservation. Approximately 50% of the phosphate comes from agriculture soil run off and by reducing this it would make a significant improvement to the water quality in the area. During the course farmers and land managers are made aware of the consequence of soil from farmland ending up in the river system, and the subsequent impact on the environment and the potential cost to the farmer. A site improvement plan with an agreed timescale is also created with the farmer to look at how to resolve their specific issue. The Environment Agency hope this will encourage farmers to reduce the soil run off from their land, but if there is no sign of improvement within a given time scale, we will not hesitate to take enforcement action. The feedback from the first course has been really positive. It is hoped this course will be able to educate people and so that the Environment Agency and landowners can work together to rectify these issues in Herefordshire. Andrew Osbaldiston, Environment Agency Catchment Coordinator said: “These courses are being trialled as a new approach to the way we carry out our regulatory activities. Whilst we are working with key partners to help inform Land Managers on their responsibilities to prevent soil erosion, we also need to regulate where there are significant non-compliance issues associated with soil loss to our watercourses. We are hopeful that the introduction of these courses, combined with other collaborative working will help deliver the necessary environmental and economic improvements within the Wye Catchment.” If any members of the public witnesses large amounts of soil washing off fields into nearby watercourses or other pollution events please contact the Environment Agency on our freephone incident hotline 0800 807060 where your calls will be treated in confidence."

/government/news/environment-agency-says-thanks-for-coming,"More than 100 people visited the Civic Hall, Totnes on Saturday 16 April to see proposals on how flood risk from the River Dart could be reduced in the town.   Environment Agency says ‘thanks for coming’  Environment Agency The ideas were being shared by the Environment Agency who has funding for improving the existing flood defences. Dan Boswell, Project Manager, said: We were really pleased that so many people came to talk to us and let us know what they thought about our ideas. The feedback we have received will really help us develop the project. The proposed work is likely to include raising the existing walls along with individual property protection and the installation of flood gates on slipways. Added Dan Boswell: It was good that some of the people who live in the areas where we are proposing to carry out work were able to attend. We really want to develop plans that have the support of people in Totnes, so the insight they were able to give us was invaluable. We have identified a number of individuals who we want to stay in touch with as we develop our ideas. Some visitors to the event asked about whether upstream catchment management had been considered as part of the improvements. Upstream catchment management is a method of reducing flood risk by carrying out work in the wider river catchment. This can help ease flood flows; not only delaying the time it takes for a river to peak, but also by reducing peak flows. These measures are often small scale, but applied over the entirety of the catchment can produce significant benefit. They can include work like the creation of wet woodland, changes in farming practices and re-meandering. The project team had considered whether this would be an option for Totnes but found that due to the size of the River Dart catchment and the influence of the tide on flood risk in the town it was not practicable. However, it is being considered elsewhere locally to help reduce flood risk in Buckfastleigh. The Environment Agency is currently investigating options to reduce peak flows on the River Mardle through catchment works upstream. Some visitors had information about issues in the town which were not connected to the flood defence improvements. The Environment Agency will collate the issues highlighted and pass these on to Devon County Council. Other points raised by visitors included questions around how the finished defences would look and a plea that the character of the town be taken into consideration in the designs. Tom Buxton-Smith, an engineer with the Environment Agency, said: We appreciate that people are very proud of where they live and we want to come up with a design which reflects the heritage of the town but provides robust defences to reduce flood risk, especially to those most at risk. Visitors were able to try out a flood door which was on display. The toughened door would be used to replace existing doors in properties which would still be at risk of flooding after the existing defences were improved. Many expressed surprise how it just looked like an ordinary door and were reassured this was the case. The Environment Agency hope to have their designs ready to submit for planning in the summer and, if planning permission is received, intend to start work by the end of the year.

The problem was caused by Charminster Bridge that was unable to cope with high flows in the River Cerne. Water quickly rose above the bridge’s 3 small arches and flooded nearby properties. In 2014 the village’s historic Saxon church, a grade one listed building, was seriously damaged. A study, led by the Environment Agency, concluded that a new bridge was needed to solve the flood problem. Special permission had to be obtained from English Heritage to demolish the bridge – a grade 2 listed structure. Engineers used hydraulic modelling of the river, historic rainfall data and groundwater levels to come up with the best design – a raised 2 span bridge that would allow higher flows to pass through the village. Highways drainage improvements were also identified and agreed with Dorset County Council. After careful consideration, English Heritage gave the go-ahead for a scheme on the condition an archaeological survey was carried out on the structure to obtain a historic record of the old bridge that dates from 1791. As much of the original masonry as possible was used in the new bridge that was built by a team of Dorset County Highways masons. Re-used materials included bricks, keystones and saddleback copings – many of them in top quality Portland stone. To minimise disruption, a temporary scaffold footbridge was constructed to allow pedestrians access to the school on one side of the river and the village shop on the other. This was necessary during construction of the new bridge when the road had to be closed. In a nod to history, a ‘transportation plaque’ has been installed on the side of the new bridge. These plaques were once a common sight on some of Dorset’s bridges. One was fixed to Charminster Bridge until it was removed many years ago. Under the Malicious Injuries to Property Act 1827, the plaques sternly warn anyone caught ‘wilfully injuring’ any part of county bridge will be guilty of felony and, upon conviction, liable to be Transported for Life. The new flood alleviation scheme will be officially opened midday on Friday 6 May, when dignitaries from Dorset County Council and the Environment Agency will be joined by West Dorset MP, Oliver Letwin, for a ribbon cutting ceremony on Charminster Bridge. Nick Lyness, the Environment Agency’s Area Flood Risk Manager, said: We are very pleased to mark the completion of the new bridge, which will bring a great benefit to the village. Engineers from the Environment Agency and Dorset County Council worked closely with Historic England to build a flood scheme that blends in with the historic character of Charminster. Councillor Peter Finney, Dorset County Council Cabinet member for environment, said: We are proud to have been a part of this project. It will make a real difference to the community and help protect nearby historic buildings. Every care has been taken to ensure the new bridge has as much of the original character as possible and, what’s more, it looks great. In addition to protecting Charminster’s historic church and adjacent listed properties, the scheme will help safeguard 3 ancient yew trees in the local churchyard thought to be around 600 years old. The Charminster scheme has been shortlisted for the Institute of Civil Engineering (ICE) South West Engineering Project of the Year."
/government/news/dorset-river-improvements-now-allow-fish-to-migrate-upstream,"Fish-friendly changes made to the Rivers Frome, Piddle, Asker and Brit by the Environment Agency and partners. Dorset river improvements now allow fish to migrate upstream  Environment Agency It is now easier for salmon and sea trout to migrate up some of Dorset’s best known rivers thanks to the efforts of a unique partnership that has been working to boost fish numbers by removing man-made obstacles such as hatches and weirs. Improvements at 10 sites on the Rivers Frome, Piddle, Asker and Brit have made it possible for fish to swim upstream to spawning grounds for the first time in many years. As well as salmon and sea trout, removal of barriers will help other species including eels and coarse fish. The work has been carried out by the Environment Agency, Frome, Piddle and West Dorset Fisheries Association, Westcountry Rivers Trust and the Friends of Rivers Group. Jim Flory of the Environment Agency said: “It has been a real success with each organisation playing a specific role. None of us could have achieved the work on our own. “We’ve shared expertise, experience and costs to remove these barriers to fish passage. It’s an excellent example of partnership working.” Charles Dutton, chairman of the Frome, Piddle and West Dorset Fisheries Association, said: “We’ve removed 10 significant obstacles that were stopping fish moving upstream. The work has made a real difference to these rivers.” Improvements ranged from simple solutions that took only a few days to put in place to major engineering works such as fish passes. To celebrate their success, the partnership held a special event at Frampton, Dorchester on Friday 22 April, where representatives from each organisation showcased their work and gave people a tour of one of their latest projects – a new fish pass at Crockway House. Barriers have been built on many rivers over the past 100 years to control water levels. Unfortunately, this has prevented migratory species such as salmon and sea trout from reaching the headwaters to spawn. This restriction of movement combined with issues like pollution has led to a decline in fish numbers in some rivers. These factors not only impact on the ecology of our rivers, it also affects those who enjoy the water environment."
/government/news/water-release-at-wimbleball-reservoir-to-help-young-salmon,"Water was released from Wimbleball Reservoir on Exmoor on Tuesday 3 May, to try and help young salmon (smolts) to move downstream on the River Exe.  Water release at Wimbleball Reservoir to help young salmon  Environment Agency More than 300,000,000 litres of water will be released over 3 days to aid salmon smolt migration downstream. The Environment Agency asks South West Water, who manage the reservoir with Wessex Water, to release the water. The release is a mitigation measure resulting from the construction of Wimbleball Lake in the 1970s. It is particularly useful to do this in the spring, if there are low flow levels, to assist the salmon smolts to move down river towards the sea. This helps encourage them to migrate without delay, protecting them from predation. Stuart Hunter, for the Environment Agency, said: To give England’s salmon populations greater resilience, we are working with partners to maximise the output of healthy smolts from our rivers. We recognise that there is much more to be done and we will continue to work with our partners to safeguard England’s salmon populations. It is through working together that we can give salmon a much needed helping hand. This type of operation is a regular occurrence, along with one in December, to aid upstream fish migration for spawning, and it compensates for the impact to the River Haddeo, a tributary of the River Exe, from Wimbleball reservoir. This amount of water being released on Exmoor will equate to a rise of just a few centimetres by the time it gets to Exeter. But this is still enough, particularly in periods of prolonged low flows, to give salmon the incentive to move downstream. We decide when and if the releases will be used. Timing is crucial and is largely dependent on flow and temperature, which dictate when smolts are ready to begin their downstream migration. We also often make a summer release to encourage adult salmon to migrate from the estuary into the river to begin their journey to their spawning grounds in the upper reaches of the River Exe. We make sure that key landowners and users of the river are advised of this release of water before it happens. James King, Director of Operations, Water Resources and Production, South West Water, said: We are delighted to be able to assist the Environment Agency in their efforts to support the migration of young salmon in this way. We are in the fortunate position in our region to have a very strong water resource storage position which means plentiful water supplies for customers and the ability to support environmental activities such as this."

The proposals include improving an existing flood storage area and creating a new underground culvert to help manage the flow of water through the area. There’ll also be additional benefits for people and wildlife with plans to redevelop the former BBC Pebble Mill site, and create new habitat and recreation areas at Harborne Lane and the Upper Bourn Brook. The area of Selly Park North and Selly Oak has a history of flooding from the River Rea, most notably in 2008 when residents were forced to move out of their homes as a result of flood damage. To help, the Rea Catchment Partnership has been investigating options for reducing the level of flood risk for up to 150 properties along a 3km stretch, including these areas. Mike Adams, Environment Agency Flood Risk Adviser, said: Flooding can have devastating impacts on people and their homes, often long after the water has gone. Some of the residents here have already experienced that first hand. This is a great opportunity for the community to come and talk to us and tell us what they think about the plans to help reduce the risk in future. If you’re unable to attend, you can request to see the plans and comment by visiting www.reacatchmentpartnership.co.uk and selecting ‘Contact us’. The Environment Agency encourages everyone to check if they’re at risk of flooding and register to receive free flood warnings by going online or calling Floodline on 0345 988 1188. Note to editors The Environment Agency, Birmingham City Council and Calthorpe Estates are working with a number of partners as part of a group called the Rea Catchment Partnership .

/government/news/catterick-flood-alleviation-scheme-work-begins,"Work starts on a partnership project to protect a North Yorkshire village from flooding. Catterick flood alleviation scheme work begins  Environment Agency Construction of a new storage reservoir to protect Catterick Village and the A1 motorway from flooding started on Tuesday 10 May. Mark Scott, Area Manager for the Environment Agency, and Vanessa Gilbert, Regional Director (Yorkshire & North East) for Highways England, teamed up to dig the first trench of the £6 million scheme before mechanical excavators took over. The new storage reservoir will be built upstream of Catterick – between Brough Park and the A1 – and will be able to hold 91 million gallons of water which, in a storm event, would overwhelm Brough Beck putting the village and surrounding area at risk of flooding. The project has been jointly funded by the Environment Agency, Highways England and North Yorkshire County Council and will take a year to complete. The main works will comprise two large earth embankments up to six metres high, diversion of Brough Beck and the construction of a new flow control structure. Landscaping will also be undertaken which will include tree planting, reinstatement of hedgerows and the creation of a wetland pond. The flood storage area will provide a significantly improved standard of flood protection for 149 homes and businesses as well as protecting the A1 motorway which is vital to the region’s economy. The banks are being built by the Environment Agency’s own field team, headed by project engineer Mark Bailey, with specialist contractors being brought in to construct the concrete water control structure. Phil Boyes, the Environment Agency’s project manager for the scheme, said: When completed, the storage reservoir will hold flood water back so it flows more slowly down Brough Beck towards Catterick Village and the new section of the A1. This will significantly reduce flood risk in the area. The scheme would not have been possible without the support of Highways England and North Yorkshire County Council whose commitment was vital in enabling us to secure the necessary funding so the work could go ahead. We have also worked closely with the local community and Richmondshire District Council to ensure that the works have very little impact on the area. All construction traffic will access the site from the A1 and the recently completed Catterick central junction, thereby avoiding the need for heavy lorries to pass through the village. We have also undertaken detailed ecological surveys to ensure that the impact on local wildlife is minimised and we will be installing bird and owl boxes as part of the site accommodation works."
/government/publications/foss-barrier-investigation-report,"The Environment Agency commissioned an independent investigation by CH2M to look at how water entered the Foss Barrier building on Boxing Day 2015. Foss Barrier: investigation report  Environment Agency On 26 December 2015 over 600 properties along the River Foss in York flooded. The Environment Agency operates the Foss Barrier and pumping station which is designed to prevent flooding by stopping the River Ouse (when in flood) backing up the River Foss. When the barrier gate is closed the River Foss is pumped around the gate with 8 high capacity pumps. On 26 December 2015, the pumping station was unable to cope with the extremely high flows coming down the River Foss and Environment Agency staff turned off the 8 pumps and lifted the barrier between the Rivers Foss and Ouse. This was to prevent even more serious flooding as, had the gate remained in the lowered position, water would have built up behind the gate causing the water levels in the Foss to be higher, putting more properties at risk of flooding. The extreme nature of the Boxing Day floods also led to water leaking into the Foss Barrier control room, putting the power supply to the building, and the ability to raise the barrier, at risk. The report was commissioned in February 2016 to look at how water got into the pumping station building and to recommend remedial actions to minimise the risk of water entering the building in the future. The exceptionally high water levels in the River Foss on 26 December 2015 exceeded the capacity of all eight pumps. The report states that had the barrier not been raised, then the levels in the River Foss would have continued to rise until it spilled over the top of the barrier gate. Without raising the barrier the peak water level on the River Foss would have occurred some 18 hours earlier. In addition to exceeding the capacity of the pumps, the extreme nature of the flood caused water to enter the building’s service tunnel drainage system. The report found that leakage into the building through a construction joint and through an access cover, opened to install a mobile pump, were the 2 main routes of water entering the building. The report recommends remedial actions to minimise the future risk of water entering the building all of which the Environment Agency is including as part of the upgrade work currently underway."

/government/news/publication-of-the-foss-barrier-investigation-report,"The Environment Agency has published an independent report commissioned to investigate how water got into the Foss Barrier Pumping Station in York on 26 December 2015. Publication of the Foss Barrier investigation report  Environment Agency On Boxing Day, more than 600 homes and businesses were affected when exceptionally high rainfall and river levels led to extensive flooding in the city of York. The Environment Agency today (Thursday 12 May) published an independent report commissioned to investigate how water got into the Foss Barrier Pumping Station in York that day, forcing staff to shut down the pumps and open the barrier. The report’s findings, by consultants CH2M, confirm that: The peak flow in the Foss on 26 December was extreme, equating to an event with a 0.5% (1/200) probability of occurring each year. All eight pumps at the Foss Barrier were working that day at full capacity but the water levels in the Foss continued to rise, by approximately 140mm an hour. The Environment Agency’s decision to raise the barrier on the evening of 26 December prevented even more widespread flooding; and delayed the peak water levels on the River Foss by some 18 hours. Environment Agency staff opened the barrier after water entered the building, forcing them to turn off the electricity supply and the pumps. The report found that a build up of water in the barrier’s underground service tunnel, combined with water flowing through the drainage system, filled the service tunnel until water emerged from the floor access points inside the pumping station building. The report concludes that most of the water that entered the building did so via the service tunnel drainage system through a combination of a leaking construction joint and an access cover which had been opened to pump water out of the service tunnel. The report makes a number of recommendations to minimise the risk of water entering the facility in future. The Foss Barrier has been fully operational since the end of December. A £17 million upgrade is now underway which will address all the recommendations made in the report. This includes addressing water leaks in the service tunnel and new pumps with an increased capacity which will be installed by winter 2016. By the end of 2017 the pumping station will have been raised to ensure the barrier is more resilient in the long term. Sir James Bevan, Chief Executive of the Environment Agency, said: I was in York in the immediate aftermath of the Boxing Day floods. I know that every house and business flooded is a personal tragedy. We can never prevent all flooding, but we can and will do everything we can to help reduce the risk to householders and businesses. I welcome this report, which will help us make the Foss Barrier even more resilient in future to extreme floods and greater flows on the River Foss. The upgrade work, which began in April, will see the pump capacity increase, providing a higher standard of protection for local people. Work on the Foss Barrier is just one component of a wider programme of work, following the Government’s announcement of £45 million for York. We are taking a catchment wide approach to improve flood resilience in the city, looking at how we can slow the flow in the upper reaches of the Ouse and Foss catchments as well as new flood defences. Residents and other interested parties will have the opportunity to find out more about the package of work the Environment Agency is planning for York, the upgrade of the Foss Barrier and the independent report, at a public exhibition to be held on 20-21 May at the Hotel 53, Piccadilly, York. Notes to Editors Levels on the River Foss on Boxing Day 2015 were higher than anything previously recorded over the past 30 years. Consultants, CH2M, were instructed to look into how water got into the structure and what steps would need to be taken to minimise the risk of it ever happening again. The report provides a summary of the facts relating to 26 December 2015 when water entered the building at the Foss Barrier, including a full sequence of events. It also makes recommendations for minimising the risk of water entering the building in the future. Read the full report"

/government/news/public-drop-in-to-discuss-river-frome-habitat-improvements,"Severn Rivers Trust and the Environment Agency are holding a drop-in event to share potential options for the habitat improvement project. Public drop-in to discuss River Frome habitat improvements  Environment Agency The proposed location for the project is near Bonds Mill on the River Frome. The drop-in session will be held on Thursday 26 May 2016 between 3pm and 7:30pm at: Leonard Stanley Village Hall 1 Marsh Mews Marsh Road Leonard Stanley Stonehouse GL10 3TB The two organisations are working in partnership on a wider project which aims to help fish negotiate some of the barriers to migration on the River Frome. Restoring an old river channel in the floodplain, near Bond’s Mill will allow fish to bypass the Mill weirs to feed, spawn and complete their lifecycles. It will also enhance habitat for a range of other wildlife which use the river. Work has taken place to draw up some options to reconnect the channel. These options will be available for the local community to view at the drop-in. There will also be representatives from Severn Rivers Trust and the Environment Agency available to provide details about the proposed options, answer questions on this particular project and how it fits in with other work undertaken and planned on the Frome. Cathy Beeching from the Environment Agency said: “The Frome is a beautiful wildlife corridor and a really important tributary of the River Severn but it could be even better. This project will not only promote habitat improvements for wildlife, but also make it better for people who use and enjoy the river.” Melissa Hoskings from Severn Rivers Trust said: “This is a fantastic opportunity to work in partnership to restore the River Frome to a more natural state to enable fish and other wildlife to flourish. The provision of additional habitat and the reconnection of this old channel will provide access to additional feeding and spawning areas, which helps to address the decline in fish stocks with the potential to help boost the rural economy.”"

Taking place on the River Wear in the centre of Durham, Cathedral to Coast is an event organised by the Environment Agency and Durham County Council, as part of World Fish Migration Day . Visitors will be able to find out about iconic local fish species from our local expert biologists and get up close to the mini-beasts in the River Wear. Visit new fish pass Durham County Council will also be giving tours of the new Freemans Reach Hydropower scheme – this innovative renewable energy project has been designed with a specialist fish pass and fish counter that not only allows migrating fish to travel freely along the river, but also tells us how many salmon and sea trout are returning to the Wear to spawn. Phil Rippon, Fisheries Specialist at the Environment Agency said: “The Environment Agency does a lot of work to help improve fish migration and we are delighted to be able to share this with the local community. Being part of a huge global event gives us a great opportunity to raise awareness about the importance of fish migration and explain what we do and why.” Day gathers momentum Now in its second year, World Fish Migration Day has gained rapid momentum, with over 1000 organisations around the globe getting involved, and a huge range of events. There will be over 400 events in 60 countries. Migration is important because many species of fish need to migrate to reproduce, feed and complete their life cycles. They also make up a crucial link in the food chain and play an important role in healthy river systems. Many migratory fish species are severely threatened. The main are obstacles like dams, weirs and sluices, which disrupt the natural flow of rivers and prevent fish moving along rivers. There are two sessions: 10am – 12 midday and 2pm – 4pm and each session is for a maximum of 25 people. Places should be booked online, via the event page ."
/government/news/housing-development-firm-fined-100000-over-construction-site-pollution,"Water containing silt and sediment was discharged into watercourse Housing development firm fined £100,000 over construction site pollution  Environment Agency A major home building company has been fined £100,000 over a pollution incident relating to a housing development in Huddersfield. Miller Homes Ltd, of Edinburgh, appeared before Leeds Crown Court on Wednesday 18 May following a pollution incident at Lindley Park, Huddersfield, in November 2013. The company admitted one environmental offence for an unauthorised discharge of water, containing silt and sediment, from the construction site into a nearby watercourse that runs into Grimescar Dyke. Flannery Civil Engineering Ltd, of Willow Bridge Way, Castleford, was fined £9,000 by Kirklees Magistrates’ Court in March after admitting a similar charge for its involvement in the same incident. Prosecuting for the Environment Agency, Chris Bunting told the court that the polluted water should have been managed on the construction site, and that neither company had permission to discharge silt water from the site. Miller Homes contracted Flannery to construct four storage lagoons in order to reduce the risk of flooding downstream. Straw bales were used on the outflow of the lower lagoon to prevent silt from leaving the site. But following heavy rainfall in November 2013, the lower lagoon filled with water, and Flannery removed the straw bales to allow it to drain. With the bales removed, silt water ran directly into the watercourse, affecting water quality. A member of the public reported the pollution incident to the Environment Agency, which sent an officer to investigate. He found that the watercourse was running a dark brown colour, and traced the source back to the development site. The officer also saw that the straw bales were situated at the side of the lagoon, no longer filtering the discharge. Water entering the top lagoon was clear, but the water leaving the bottom lagoon was cloudy. A spokesperson for the Environment Agency, said after the case: Environmental permitting laws exist to protect the environment and local communities from harm. This case shows how important it is that construction and other industrial companies adhere to the regulations to ensure that their activities do not pose a risk of pollution. Miller Homes should have had more effective water management systems on the construction site to prevent the silty run-off from affecting local watercourses. If anyone spots pollution of this kind, they are urged to contact the Environment Agency’s incident hotline on 0800 807060 so we can investigate. In mitigation, Miller Homes said they immediately improved the lagoon system following the incident. They added that they are one of a small number of house building companies that had achieved an accreditation for environmental standards,and that their board of directors had been “apoplectic” that the problem had not been reported to the Environment Agency or even themselves at the time. The company was also ordered to pay £2,901.03 in costs."

/government/news/new-fish-pass-near-lincoln-now-complete-opening-up-34km-of-river-witham,"A new pass has opened up 34 kilometres (21 miles) of the River Witham for fish and eels, making it easier for them to migrate and spawn.  New fish pass near Lincoln now complete, opening up 34km of River Witham  Environment Agency Coarse fish and salmonids like brown trout will have access to more of the river, helping link up isolated fish populations and making spawning easier. Improvements have also been made to the habitat, providing fish and invertebrates a refuge from high flows and predators. This work will help boost fish populations and benefit the wider ecology of the river. Previously, fish could swim freely up the 14km of the River Witham from Stamp End in Lincoln to the Aubourn weir south of the city. But now that the weir has been removed and a fish pass installed, they can also swim up the next 20km between Aubourn and Claypole. Nearly 1,000 tonnes of stone – mostly Leicestershire granite – was used to complete the rock ramp, considered the best and most natural means of passage at this location. Boulders and carefully-placed smaller stones form bars across the channel to make it easier for fish and eels to get upstream, with three rows of piling keeping the stone in place. Environment Agency Fisheries Officer Matthew Parr said: “This fish pass will help increase the number and hopefully the variety of fish within the river system and boost the ecology, helping us achieve more for wildlife and the environment. “We’ve worked very closely with the local angling club, using their expert knowledge to create 15 areas of new habitat over a kilometre stretch of river, including in-channel berms, deeper pools, and woody material to provide shade and cover. These will also increase the overall health of the river.” Matthew added: “It’s timely that we’ve finished it the week before World Fish Migration Day, which falls this Saturday, 21 May and aims to highlight the work going on around the globe to help migrating fish.” To mark World Fish Migration Day, the Environment Agency has revealed that more than 20,000km of England’s rivers have been opened up to improve fish migration over the last four years – the equivalent distance of London to Rio and back. Ends Notes to editors: World Fish Migration Day helps raise awareness of the importance of open rivers and migratory fish and takes place on Saturday, 21 May 2016. You can find out more on the event’s website . The £100,000 project took 3 months to complete and was installed after the Aubourn weir, which serves no flood defence purposes, was decommissioned. The project was completed by Environment Agency framework contractors Balfour Beatty (in conjunction with their sub contractors A&V Squires, WaterCo and Forest Farm Tree Services)."
/government/news/putting-fish-on-the-highway-to-success,"More than 20,000km of England’s rivers have been opened up to improve fish migration over the last 4 years – the equivalent distance of London to Rio and back – the Environment Agency reveals on World Fish Migration Day (21st May).  Putting fish on the ‘highway’ to success  Environment Agency Almost 200 obstructions have been overcome – this means fish passes installed or weirs removed. Migration is important because many species of fish need to migrate to reproduce, feed and complete their life cycles. Weir removals and fish passes create ‘fish highways’ making a faster, easier route from the sea right up to the upper reaches of rivers. This work benefits coarse fish that spend their entire lives in the river, as well as the species that migrate between the river and the sea, such as eel, salmon and sea trout. Young eels make an incredible journey more than 5,000km across the Atlantic Ocean from the Sargasso Sea to rivers all over Europe – and adult fish make the return journey to spawn. It’s not always possible to remove all weirs – for example, many are still being used and can’t be removed if buildings, walls or bridges could be damaged, where the risk of flooding would increase or if there is heritage interest. In these cases fish passes are the solution. Sarah Chare, Head of Fisheries at the Environment Agency, said: “After considerable investment, rivers in England are the healthiest for 20 years. This is down to more than a decade of hard work to improve the health of England’s rivers. But there is more to do and opening up our rivers to help fish migrate is a crucial part of this. By working with partners we can play to different organisations’ strengths, make our money go further and deliver more.” The Environment Agency has been working with partners on projects all over the country. One recent success of removing a barrier to migration is a new fish pass on the River Tyne. Here the Tyne Rivers Trust worked with Northumberland County Council and the Environment Agency to build Hexham fish pass which opens up access to many kilometers of spawning and juvenile habitat. In Yorkshire, the Environment Agency has worked with partners and made significant additions to Yorkshire’s ‘fish highways’ – removing 2 weirs on the River Don in Sheffield and a weir on the River Aire in Leeds. Both rivers are now returning to a natural series of shallow, fast sections separated by deeper pools – which provide a better habitat for the coarse fish, grayling and brown trout that live there and for the invertebrates that they feed on. In Dorset it is now easier for salmon and sea trout to migrate up some of the county’s best-known rivers thanks to the efforts of a unique partnership that has been working to boost fish numbers by removing man-made obstacles such as hatches and weirs. Improvements at 10 sites on the Rivers Frome, Piddle, Asker and Brit have made it possible for fish to swim upstream to spawning grounds for the first time in many years. The World Fish Migration Day is a one day global-local event to create awareness on the importance of open rivers and migratory fish. More than 1,000 organizations around the globe are involved.

/government/news/glastonbury-festival-fined-for-causing-pollution,"Bristol Magistrates Court has ordered Glastonbury Festival Ltd to pay £31,000 after pollution went into the Whitelake River. Glastonbury Festival fined for causing pollution  Environment Agency The organisers of Glastonbury Festival, the world’s biggest music festival, have been ordered to pay £31,000 in fines and costs for pollution offences involving human sewage. More than 4km of the Whitelake River was polluted after approximately 20,000 gallons of untreated sewage escaped from a temporary storage tank on a farm at Pilton, near Shepton Mallet, on June 29, 2014. The pollution killed more than 40 fish and effectively wiped out the local trout population. Glastonbury Festival plead guilty to the offence at an earlier hearing. The Environment Agency also asked that an incident from last year’s event involving overflow from a tank fed into by the festival’s ‘long drop’ toilets also be taken into consideration. Judge Simon Cooper ruled that Glastonbury Festival’s actions after the fish kill had not been negligent and were of low culpability. Hearing the organisers had been issued a caution after the 2010 festival, he ordered that a fine of £12,000 now be payable along with £19,000 costs for the two offences. The Environment Agency monitors water quality in the Whitelake River throughout the festival using telemetry equipment positioned upstream and downstream of Worthy Farm. Additional monitoring is carried out by the festival’s environmental team who are expected to alert the Agency if they discover pollution within the site. During a two-day Newton hearing this week, Bristol Magistrates Court heard how the the music festival’s monitoring team failed to alert Environment Agency staff in the agreed manner after sewage leaked into a tributary of the Whitelake River. On-site monitoring detected a spike in pollution at around 1am on June 29. It was claimed that Glastonbury Festival called the out-of-hours Environment Agency officer on a dedicated telephone line. However, with no call records to prove this had taken place, and with no recollection from the employee, the judge said in the balance of probability the call had not happened. This failure to alert the Agency through the proper channel resulted in a delay and caused a serious deterioration in water quality. The judge was satisfied there was a pollution monitoring system in place, and that “conditions were not straightforward” while searching in the dark with a lot of facilities in the vicinity. He praised Glastonbury Festival staff for their efforts in stopping the spill once it was found. He said its actions would have been “unimpeachable” if it had contacted the Agency via the hotline to assist in the search for the pollution. The source of the pollution was traced to a leaking storage tank at Steanbow Park Farm, Pilton. The tank was installed and operated by Glastonbury Festival Ltd and used to store untreated sewage during the five-day festival. Festival staff created an earth bund to contain the pollution, which was later removed from site by tanker. The sewage spill killed at least 42 fish including 29 bullhead – a European protected species – 10 brown trout and 3 stone loach. A fish survey revealed that no trout survived the incident. On-site monitoring was introduced by the festival organisers following a history of water quality problems during the event. Ian Withers, Environment Manager for the Environment Agency said: While we recognise the Glastonbury Festival provides enjoyment to tens of thousands of people and raises money for a number of good causes, the organisers have a responsibility to ensure it does not cause harm to the environment. The festival is held in a beautiful part of the Somerset countryside and we want to see it remain that way. This was a serious pollution incident that had a significant impact on water quality and the fish population of the Whitelake River over some distance. Environment Agency staff respond 24/7 following reports to our pollution hotline, 0800 80 70 60. We urge prompt reporting so we can protect water quality and the environment. ENDS Note to Editors: Glastonbury Festival is the world’s largest outdoor music and contemporary arts festival attracting up to 175,000 people to Worthy Farm, Pilton, Somerset every year. Held over 5 days, the festival has been running since 1970 and has grown steadily in size over the years. A Newton hearing was asked for by Bristol Magistrates Court to decide the gravity of the offence committed. This would have been classed as causing Category 1 or Category 2 damage to the environment. The hearing was also to determine if Glastonbury Festival Ltd was negligent by failing to take reasonable care to put in place proper systems to avoid committing the offence. At an earlier hearing, Glastonbury Festival Ltd plead guilty to causing a water discharge activity not under or in accordance with an environmental permit, namely the discharge of human sewage derived from the Glastonbury music festival, contrary to regulations 12(1)(b) and 38(1)(a) of the Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2010. The festival site is situated in a valley at the head of the Whitelake River on the southern edge of the Mendip Hills. Two small streams join on site to form the Whitelake. Although called a river, the Whitelake is a relatively small watercourse.

/government/news/flood-defence-work-at-bacup-road-finishes,"Improvements have been made at 22 locations to manage water coming off the moors  Flood defence work at Bacup Road finishes  Environment Agency A flood risk reduction scheme in the Bacup Road area of Todmorden is now complete. The scheme was developed by the Environment Agency and Calderdale Council in response to the floods of 2012 and 2013 where properties and businesses in and around the Bacup Road area were badly affected. The work has concentrated on a 2.2 mile section of Bacup Road between Gauxholme and the Todmorden Astronomy Centre on the Yorkshire-Lancashire border. Improvements have been made at 22 locations to manage water coming off the moors and improve capacity in the existing culverts. New road drains have been installed, and headwall structures and trash screens placed at culverts allow safer access to remove any debris that could cause a flood risk. Environment Agency Project manager, James Walton said: The contractor worked in particularly challenging environments to construct these schemes and we were grateful for the patience shown by local residents and the cooperation of landowners to enable the works to be carried out. In December, the Bacup Road scheme, although partially complete, was put to the test during the floods and performed as designed. Now that the work has completed they have been formally handed back to Calderdale Council. Calderdale Council’s Leader, Cllr Tim Swift, said: We’re pleased that the scheme is now complete and has already proven to be effective, as part of the Council and Environment Agency’s joint work to help reduce flood risk. It’s not possible to totally remove the risk of flooding, so we encourage residents and businesses to do all they can to be prepared, reduce their own risk and keep up to date with flooding related information at www.calderdale.gov.uk/flooding. As well as planning major schemes for the Calder Valley including Hebden Bridge and Mytholmroyd, teams are now looking at the next programme of medium scale works which form part of the Upper Calder flood risk reduction scheme. A scheme is being developed to reduce the risk of flooding which causes major disruption to traffic along the A646 trunk road. This road, between Hebden Bridge and Todmorden regularly floods and pools in the dip outside Brearley Mills, Eastwood. A scheme is also being proposed along the same trunk road at Woodland View. A video of the Bacup Road flood risk reduction scheme can be viewed on Youtube ."
/government/news/public-views-sought-on-howsham-fish-pass-plan,"Consultation on options for helping migrating fish, eel and lamprey Public views sought on Howsham fish pass plan  Environment Agency The Environment Agency is seeking public views on proposals to install a lamprey, fish and eel pass at Howsham Weir on the River Derwent in Yorkshire. A consultation will run from Thursday 30 June to Thursday 8 September to allow people to comment on the plans and raise any issues they would like taken into consideration before plans are developed. Howsham Weir, situated where between York and Malton, has been targeted for improvement because it prevents migrating fish, eel, and lamprey from accessing breeding and feeding grounds upstream. The weir also prevents species from re-colonising the river upstream after flooding, drought or pollution incidents. The Environment Agency wants to consult with interested parties because this stretch of river and the weir is popular with other river users, including canoeists and anglers. A public drop-in event will be held at Welburn Village Hall on Monday, 18 July, from 4pm to 7pm, to allow people to find out about the plans and discuss the options. Ineke Jackson, project manager at the Environment Agency, said: Installing a fish passage at Howsham Weir would help lamprey, fish and eel populations that are prevented from reaching upstream spawning grounds. However, the river is used by a wide variety of people and we want them to be involved in helping us find the best solution. People with an interest in this stretch of the Derwent are urged to get involved in the consultation and call in at the drop-in event if they want to discuss the proposals face-to-face. Information on the consultation will be available online from 30 June on the Gov.UK website . Further information can also be obtained by calling the Environment Agency’s contact centre on 03708 506506."
/government/news/companies-ordered-to-pay-for-water-pollution,"A Devon company producing energy from agricultural waste at Menchine Farm, Tiverton, and the site owner, have been fined over £10,000 and ordered to pay £7,019 costs for polluting 2.5km of the River Dalch. Companies ordered to pay for water pollution  Environment Agency Site operator, Greener For Life Energy Ltd, and site owner and permit holder Nomansland Biogas Ltd, both pleaded guilty at Exeter Magistrates’ Court on 23 June 2016 to negligently polluting the watercourse last year and contravening the requirements of an environmental permit. The case was brought by the Environment Agency following a report of suspected pollution in the River Dalch on 11 February 2015. The Environment Agency’s investigation found that the source of pollution – the escape of liquid silage effluent into the River Dalch - was from Menchine Farm where the biogas plant was being operated. Silage effluent is an acidic liquid produced during the silage making process which can be a serious pollutant, especially if it drains into a watercourse. At Menchine Farm, agricultural waste and energy crops collected from nearby farms are turned into gas in a process known as anaerobic digestion. Both companies accepted they were negligent in causing liquid silage liquor to drain off their site into the river. An Environment Officer who visited the site found extensive sewage fungus along a stretch of the river with 100 per cent sewage fungus coverage for 1km from the discharge point and a total of 2.5km of the River Dalch impacted with significant sewage fungus growth. The presence of sewage fungus is indicative of significant organic pollution. Richard Tugwell, Environment Officer investigating for the Environment Agency, said: Silage effluent has a severely polluting effect - it is 100 times more polluting than raw sewage. Starving the river of oxygen has led to a significant adverse effect on water quality, animal health and flora. We are satisfied with the outcome and pleased the courts have taken this matter seriously. It took over a week for the watercourse to return to its natural condition. If anyone spots a potential pollution issue please report it to the Environment Agency’s free 24-hour incident hotline on 0800 80 70 60."
/government/news/work-to-start-on-second-phase-of-32-million-exeter-flood-defence-scheme,"Phase 2 of Exeter’s multi-million pound scheme to reduce flood risk to 3,200 homes and businesses gets underway next week.  Work to start on second phase of £32 million Exeter flood defence scheme  Environment Agency The £32 million scheme, a partnership between the Environment Agency, Devon County Council and Exeter City Council, will see construction activity around the city over the next 2 years. The Environment Agency is working with contractor BMM to minimise disruption and is encouraging those who live and work in Exeter to sign up to Exeter City Council’s email updates to find out what is happening and when. Richard Cox for the Environment Agency said: This is fantastic news for the city. Inevitably this will cause some disruption but we hope people understand we need to carry out this work to reduce flood risk to people and properties in Exeter. We will be building the new flood defences in a way which minimises disruption to those living, working and visiting here. Construction work starts in the Countess Wear area of the city. In order to gain access here, a temporary track across Northbrook Golf Course is going to be built. This means that we can avoid using School Lane and Mill Road and will also reduce how many of our construction vehicles use Bridge Road. The land will be reinstated to its original condition when the work is completed in 2018. Temporary fencing will also be put up through the Riverside Valley Park to separate vehicles from the public. This will allow the material excavated during phase 1 works (currently stored on Bromham’s Farm playing fields) to be transported to locations throughout Exeter where we are building new flood embankments. The majority of the park will remain open to the public during the work this summer. Investigation work is also being carried out at the Quay to check the precise location of utilities such as power cables and gas pipes. Construction work on new demountable flood defences will then start in November – avoiding the busy summer season. Added Richard: We recognise the Quay is a popular place for residents and visitors which is why we have been keen to plan our work to avoid the busiest time. Steps we have taken to minimise disruption include: accessing key areas outside of peak traffic hours to avoid contributing to local congestion co-ordinating with other planned road works to reduce disruption restricting hours of work to avoid noise disturbance opting for single lane road closures rather than closing roads Councillor Rachel Sutton, Exeter City Council’s Lead Councillor for City Development, said: We’re pleased that the next phase of the Exeter flood defence scheme is about to start, which will protect over 3,000 properties within the city limits when complete. Working together, the Environment Agency, Exeter City Council and Devon County Council have developed plans so that the scheme can be built with minimal disruption to residents and local businesses. Our council officers have been heavily involved with this next phase of the project to ensure the works are in keeping with the city. The success of partnership working has been seen within the first phase of the project which has provided a haven for people and wildlife within the Trew’s flood relief channel, whilst reducing flood risk to the Quay area. Councillor Andrew Leadbetter, Devon County Council Cabinet Member for Economy and Growth, said: The scheme has made excellent progress to date and every effort is being made to ensure that this next phase causes as little disruption as possible. The access road off the local highway network will reduce the amount of movements on our roads, which should help to keep Devon moving. The phase 2 work will ensure we have a flood defence scheme which will improve protection for homes and businesses in the city, which is why it was a priority for Devon County Council to invest £3 million in the scheme. Phase 1 of the scheme got underway in 2014 and saw construction work just downstream of Exeter Quay. The Trew’s flood relief channel and the side spill weir at the top of the channel have been lowered. This increased the flow capacity of the flood relief channel, which will help reduce flood risk during high river flows. The check weir at the downstream end of the flood relief channel will be removed later in 2016 to increase flow capacity further. Exeter City Council and Devon County Council each contributed £3 million to the scheme. £6 million has come from government growth funding and the remainder is being funded by flood defence grant in aid. The project offices are located in Bromham’s field behind the changing rooms. People are welcome to visit the offices if they have any questions or would like to meet the site team.

The meeting will be held on Thursday 14 July from 3pm to 7pm at Skeffling Village Hall, Skeffling, HU12 0UX. Members of the project team will be on hand to give information and answer any questions or concerns about some of the key changes that have had to be made to the project and give details of what the project is aiming to achieve in the year ahead. Environment Agency Project Manager, Tim Cobb, said: The key changes to this project are the size, shape and location of the potential habitat area. We need to create compensatory habitat to allow other critical flood risk management projects around the estuary to progress. To do this we have to work with the land that we own and now plan to utilise this. We look forward to welcoming people at our drop in meeting to discuss the plans and also welcome any other views or comments about the scheme. Please send any responses or questions by email to welwick.skeffling@environment-agency.gov.uk or in writing to: Tim Cobb NCPMS Environment Agency Lateral 8 City Walk Leeds LS11 9AT As well as delivering important habitat to replace ongoing losses, the scheme also presents an opportunity to reduce flood risk to land and communities. Construction of new defences, which will replace the old banks, will offer a higher standard of protection and reduced likelihood of breaching than the existing defences. Since the summer of 2015 the project team has been collecting environmental data on the existing habitat to ensure that the Environment Agency can provide suitable mitigation for the current wildlife. The next step in the project is to define the exact scheme footprint and habitat areas. Further environmental surveys, archaeology and ground investigations will be taking place over the next three months. The Environment Agency and ABP will then develop the outline scheme into a design in preparation for submitting a planning application for the two sites. During this process, we will be meeting with and discussing the changed project with landowners, parish councils, the community, local authority and other interested groups."
/government/news/recovery-continues-in-yorkshire-six-months-on-from-floods,"The Environment Agency is embarking on a significant programme of repairs to flood defences damaged by flooding.  Recovery continues in Yorkshire six months on from floods  Environment Agency It’s now six months on since the devastating floods of December 2015 and the Environment Agency is embarking on a significant programme of repairs to flood defences damaged by the flooding. More than 9,000 householders and businesses across north and west Yorkshire were affected by the flooding and have spent much of this time dealing with its effects. Over the last six months the Environment Agency has conducted a massive recovery operation assessing and repairing damaged flood defences, walls and structures so that they can continue to protect communities. They’ve checked nearly 8,500 assets in total and had completed all the emergency repairs by the end of February. Field teams and contractors have worked tirelessly to build temporary defences and clear obstructions such as collapsed bridges, buildings, thousands of tonnes of gravel, debris and vehicles from rivers to reduce further flood risk at 150 locations. Teams ‘working tirelessly to restore protection’ Phil Younge, major incident recovery manager at the Environment Agency said: “The floods of December 2015 had a terrible impact on peoples’ lives, homes and businesses across the county. Sadly, some residents and businesses are still feeling the effects such flooding events can bring. “Teams are working hard to get defences back in a condition they were prior to flooding. We are on track to achieve this huge challenge, and our teams are working tirelessly to restore protection to communities. “Building resilience in those communities badly affected last December is key and we have been working closely with risk management authorities, local communities and other partners to form a collaborative approach for these areas.” Programme of work begins While work continues to clear many more sites the Environment Agency is beginning its programme of work to tackle the larger scale repairs to damaged flood defences. This week they are rebuilding walls near Shade School and behind the market in Todmorden, which collapsed in the floods. Debris and gravel is also being cleared from the channel to improve the flow of water near the school. Further gravel removal works are being planned across Calderdale in the coming weeks, as well as wall repairs. Flood bank and wall repairs are being done on the River Aire, from the lower reaches of the catchment at Airmyn, all the way through Leeds and up to Skipton, where defences have slipped or been damaged by the floods. On the River Wharfe, work is about to start to repair a bank slip at Collingham near Wetherby, which was another community affected by the Christmas floods. The target is to restore assets back to pre-winter 2015 standards by the end of September 2016. Another important area of Environment Agency work has been supporting those affected by the flooding. They’ve visited around 150 communities, providing support in a variety of ways including holding community events, advising on flood resilience measures and sharing plans for future flood alleviation schemes. Asset recovery and engagement work has been a priority for the Environment Agency over the last six months, but it’s only part of the story. Since December 2015: Government announced £115 million for flood defence investment in Leeds, York and the Calder Valley Work to upgrade the Foss Barrier Pumping Station began in April and is progressing well. Three temporary pumps have been installed as well as a temporary elevated platform on which to house all the equipment while work to install new equipment progresses The Foss Barrier investigation report was published, which looked at the events leading to the opening of the barrier on Boxing Day 2015 The Leeds Flood Alleviation Scheme scoping report was launched, which sets out options to reduce flood risk to the city centre and Kirkstall Road, along with an initial timetable for delivery. The action plan for Mytholmroyd was launched which sets out the programme that will be implemented to further reduce flood risk to the town along with the anticipated timescales for delivery. A flood information centre was opened in Mytholmroyd The Calderdale Catchment Partnership has been formed to provide a collaborative process for the production of the Calderdale Catchment Plan. Worked with partners and communities to gather information to produce the flood extents of the December 2015 flood event.

It is a complex process to remove and refurbish the gate but essential to enable the gate to be operated for years to come and help manage water levels in the river channel. “There will be points of restricted access for health and safety reasons during the works but we have worked hard to minimise the disruption wherever possible. We are holding the drop-in session to provide an opportunity for the community to speak with us and learn more about these important works.”"
/government/news/stay-safe-this-summer-in-and-around-the-thames-environment-agency-warns,"School’s out for summer and there is no better time to enjoy the beauty of the River Thames than over the holidays – where you can have fun, get close to nature and spend time with friends. Stay safe this summer in and around the Thames Environment Agency warns  Environment Agency But as the navigation authority for the non-tidal stretch of the river – from Cricklade in Wiltshire to Shepperton in south west London - the Environment Agency is asking parents and guardians to warn children and young people about the dangers of playing by its locks, weirs, bridges, and anywhere else in and around the Thames. It has published the staying safe around water guide, and the overall message is clear: vigilance can save lives and water-related accidents can be avoided by knowing how to stay safe. Experience shows that it is often young people who get into trouble whilst swimming in open water. Water can contain hazards, particularly in and around structures such as locks, weirs and bridges. Unexpected cold waters or strong currents can also catch bathers off guard. Youngsters are often seen jumping off the many bridges along the Thames, while this may seem like great fun, there are hidden dangers in the water that can cause tragic consequences. Russell Robson, Waterways Operations Team Leader for the Environment Agency said: The summer is always a busy time on our rivers, and we expect the River Thames to be a focal point for a lot of people’s leisure time, whether out in a boat, taking a dip, or just hanging out by the riverside. But we are urging parents and guardians to supervise younger children closely in and around water. Teenagers and young adults should be warned of the dangers and to remember some basic safety points when out having fun. We’d really like people to read and act upon our online water safety advice – it’s so important. There’s lots of other great advice available online too, produced by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, the Canal and Rivers Trust and others. One of the main risks is cold-water shock, which can have a dramatic effect on your body, such as causing you to breathe in water, make your muscles weaken, and can even cause your heart to go into abnormal rhythms, ultimately resulting in death. You also have no idea what’s beneath the surface of the water: there could be unseen currents and reeds, which could pull you under. In an ideal world, no one would get on or in the river alone, so there would be someone around to help if they did get into any difficulties. And anyone out in any kind of boat should wear a lifejacket, just in case. As for swimming in the Thames, we’d really rather people didn’t do it unless it’s part of an organised and supervised event. Swimming should be confined to swimming pools and lidos. Notes to editors The Environment Agency has provided some information to consider when planning your days out and holidays, whilst still having fun and being safe. The advice can be used for all waterbodies and not just the Thames. Read the staying safe around water guide."
/government/consultations/oxford-flood-alleviation-scheme-options-consultation,"Have your say on the options for the proposed flood relief channel. Oxford flood alleviation scheme: options consultation  Environment Agency The Environment Agency and their partners are working together to develop a flood alleviation scheme to reduce flood risk to properties, transport links and infrastructure in Oxford. In addition, the scheme aims to protect Oxford’s reputation as a thriving commercial centre, and create and maintain recreational and environmental opportunities. Early investigations confirm that a flood relief channel would reduce flood risk in Oxford. The Environment Agency has therefore developed a series of channel options, based on their findings and the results of early public engagement about a potential scheme and what stakeholders would want. They would like to hear your views on these options, to help them identify the final route for the channel. After this consultation, they will assess which route will provide the best all-round solution to Oxford’s flooding problem. They will take into account public opinion alongside the outputs of their assessment, which considers which options would be technically and economically feasible. The Environment Agency will announce the results of the consultation by April 2016. Following this, they will work on developing a detailed design for the scheme."

/government/news/flood-repairs-start-in-northumberland-town,"The Environment Agency is due to start work to restore flood defences which were damaged during December's storms.  Flood repairs start in Northumberland town  Environment Agency Work to repair flood defences in a Northumberland town, which were damaged during the winter floods, is due to start next week. Repair work at Haydon Bridge will be carried out by the Environment Agency in two phases and will permanently repair flood defences. The first phase will start week commencing August 1, and includes: Erosion repairs on the River South Tyne. Repairs to the erosion on the north and south banks will be carried out using some of the gravel within the river channel. The Environment Agency is working closely with Northumbrian Water so that this repair work also protects their sewer within the bank side repair. Temple Houses flood wall. Starting during the same week, repairs will be carried out to the erosion damage beneath the flood wall at Temple Houses to ensure the structural integrity of the wall. The second phase of work, which is expected to start later in August, includes: Repairing the flood bank at Martins Close and Rocksprings Crescent and raising low spots behind Rocksprings Crescent. Repointing Brigwood flood wall and altering the outfalls along the wall. Flood defences restored The work, which is expected to be complete by the end of September, will permanently repair flood defences to the standard of protection they provided before the winter flooding this past December. The work is part of a £3million Environment Agency recovery programme to restore damaged flood defences. Environment Agency Operations Manager for the North East, Alan Cadas, said: “The flooding this past winter had a terrible impact on people’s lives, homes and businesses and Haydon Bridge was one of the places most affected. “We’re now in a position to carry out repair works in Haydon Bridge so residents will see us on site from next week and through until the end of September. “The programme of recovery work, to get our defences back into the condition they were in prior to flooding, is a challenge, but we’re working tirelessly to restore protection to communities.” Partnership working Since December the Environment Agency, Northumberland County Council and Northumbrian Water have been working together to tackle flooding in the Tyne Valley. This includes repairs to flood defences, sewer network maintenance, repairs to the highways infrastructure and improving community resilience. Steve Robson, Northumbrian Water’s technical support team leader, added: “Northumbrian Water is committed to continuing to work in partnership to help reduce flood risk in the Tyne Valley. “As part of this work, in Haydon Bridge, we have used cameras to survey more than 3,000 metres of sewer pipe and cleansed more than 1,200 metres of pipe. We have also relined sections of pipe under the level crossing and on the north bank of the River Tyne. “Investigation work is currently being carried out in the vicinity of the Anchor Pub, in partnership with the Environment Agency, to understand how we can prevent surface water from entering our sewer network.” Work to identify what more can be done to reduce the risk of flooding in affected communities and to increase resilience to flooding is also underway."
/government/news/flood-recovery-roadshow-for-leeds,"Incident command vehicle to visit communities Flood recovery roadshow for Leeds  Environment Agency The Environment Agency will be out and about in Leeds this week as part of an ongoing flood recovery programme following the December 2015 flooding. Many rivers across Yorkshire reached record or near record levels on Boxing Day last year. Across Leeds, more than 2,000 homes and nearly 600 businesses were affected by flooding from the River Aire and a number of other sources after 100 mm of rain fell on the catchment. Teams will head out into the heart of the communities in a state of the art, Incident Command Vehicle to provide support and guidance to those affected by the flooding. Importantly, it will give residents and businesses the opportunity to talk to Environment Agency staff and partners from Leeds City Council about their experiences and knowledge of the floods. Jonathan Follows from the Environment Agency said: We hope that by taking our incident command vehicle into the communities it will provide a more accessible way for people to come along and talk to us. During the first two stops we’re hoping to speak to the businesses in the Stourton and Hunslet areas who were affected by the flooding. Towards the end of the day we’ll move into the residential area where we’ll also have a team of staff door knocking. We’re really keen to hear about people’s experiences and get feedback on our flood extent maps. It will also be a chance for us to let residents and businesses know about the recovery work we’ve been doing in Leeds and what we’ve got planned over the coming months to reduce flood risk. Crucially, we hope to sign more people up for our free flood warning service. There is still only 19 per cent of eligible properties taking advantage of this free service with just over 101,000 properties signed up out of a potential 530,000 in Yorkshire. For the flood warning area covering Knowsthorpe, Thwaite Gate and Stourton there are only 185 properties signed up out of a total of 451 – that’s less that 50 per cent. Leader of Leeds City Council, Councillor Judith Blake said: We are very pleased to be working with the Environment Agency bringing their floods roadshow to Leeds. We are all well aware of the devastation the floods at Christmas caused in Leeds and sadly there are many businesses and residents still suffering as a result, so I would encourage as many people as possible to engage with the team to share their experiences and find out the latest information on ways people can help defend against the impact of flooding. As a city we are determined to continue our calls for Leeds to have comprehensive flood defences in place as quickly as possible. On Thursday 28 July, the incident command vehicle will be in Haigh Park, Stourton, between 1pm and 2.30pm; it will be at Hunslet Industrial Park from 2.30pm to 4pm; and it will be in the Aire Quays/Twine Street area between 4pm and 6.30pm. Over the next 18-24 months feasibility work will be completed to explore options for improving flood protection for Leeds, and to finalise the details of the scheme. A full business case will be completed to establish the appropriate standard of protection for Leeds, the measures needed to achieve this, how much it will cost and how long it will take to deliver. Following approval of the business case a construction contract will be awarded by the end of 2017. Residents and businesses can check to see if free flood warnings are available in their community and sign up by calling Floodline on 0345 9881188 or by visiting the website. As well as checking flood risk, residents can also find out what action can be taken to protect people and property by visiting the Environment Agency’s flood pages ."

Email chemicalrestrictions@environment-agency.gov.uk if your waste contains a POP for which a concentration threshold isn’t given in the table. Destroy the POP content of your waste You can send your waste to a disposal site capable of completely destroying POPs or irreversibly transforming them using one of the following methods: physico-chemical treatment (such as chemical destruction) incineration on land using the waste as a fuel or other means to generate energy (not for material containing PCBs ) It’s up to the site that takes your waste to make sure the POP content of your waste is destroyed or irreversibly transformed. But you must make sure the site is capable of destroying it using one of the methods listed. Apply to permanently store material that contains POPs In exceptional cases you can apply for permission to permanently store some types of waste and hazardous waste that contains POPs , instead of destroying them. To get approval, you’ll need to demonstrate to the Environment Agency that your waste is suitable for permanent storage and that this is environmentally preferable to destruction. Permission is given on a case by case basis. Email chemicalrestrictions@environment-agency.gov.uk if you want to discuss this option. Where you can permanently store material If the Environment Agency approves your application to store rather than destroy waste, you can store it at any of the following types of sites: deep underground hard rock formations salt mines hazardous waste landfill sites Veolia’s Minosus salt mine in Cheshire is currently the only site in the UK where you can permanently store waste that contains POPs . Email chemicalrestrictions@environment-agency.gov.uk to discuss other sites outside the UK.

Toxic equivalency factors of PCDDs and PCDFs To find out the concentration of PCDDs and PCDFs in your waste, you need to multiply the concentration of the specific PCDD or PCDF in your waste by its toxic equivalency factor ( TEF ). The TEFs of each PCDD or PCDF are provided in this section if you want to make calculations yourself. Alternatively you can email chemicalrestrictions@environment-agency.gov.uk if your material contains PCDDs or PCDFs and you want to discuss how to calculate concentrations. TEFs of PCDDs The following table lists the toxic equivalency factor for each type of PCDD : PCDD TEF 2,3,7,8-TeCDD 1 1,2,3,7,8-PeCDD 1 1,2,3,4,7,8-HxCDD 0.1 1,2,3,6,7,8-HxCDD 0.1 1,2,3,7,8,9-HxCDD 0.1 1,2,3,4,6,7,8-HpCDD 0.01 OCDD 0.0003 1,2,3,6,7,8-HxCDF 0.1 1,2,3,7,8,9-HxCDF 0.1 2,3,4,6,7,8-HxCDF 0.1 1,2,3,4,6,7,8-HpCDF 0.01 1,2,3,4,7,8,9-HpCDF 0.01 OCDF 0.0003 TEFs of PCDFs The following table gives the toxic equivalency factor for each type of PCDF : PCDF TEF 2,3,7,8-TeCDF 0.1 1,2,3,7,8-PeCDF 0.03 2,3,4,7,8-PeCDF 0.3 1,2,3,4,7,8-HxCDF 0.1 Mixtures of multiple PCDDs or PCDFs If your waste contains a mixture of several different PCDDs and PCDFs , you need to multiply each PCDD or PCDF by its TEF , and then add the concentrations together. Example calculation If your waste contains 1,2,3,7,8-PeCDD at a concentration of 14 μg per kg and 1,2,3,4,7,8-HxCDD at a concentration of 30 μg per kg, you would calculate the concentration of PCDDs and PCDFs as follows. 14 μg per kg x 1 ( TEF of 1,2,3,7,8-PeCDD) + 30 μg per kg x 0.1 ( TEF of 1,2,3,4,7,8-HxCDD) = 14 μg per kg + 3 μg per kg = 17 μg per kg In this case the concentration of PCDDs and PCDFs in your waste would be above the threshold (15 μg per kg) and you would have to follow this guide when disposing of it."

/government/news/stockton-flood-alleviation-scheme-progresses,"Environment Agency continues work to reduce the risk of flooding from Lustrum Beck  Stockton flood alleviation scheme progresses  Environment Agency Environment Agency work to reduce the risk of flooding from Lustrum Beck in Stockton is progressing. A new flood wall along the beck at Bedford Street, which started in May, is almost complete, while the new lifting screen at the culvert at Primrose Hill is now operational. Work is progressing ahead of schedule on the improved and raised embankment in the Newtown area, and construction has just begun on a flood wall along Duddon Walk. All the work is expected to be complete in September. The Environment Agency is working closely with Stockton-on-Tees Borough Council, which is replacing Londonderry Bridge to allow the beck to flow more freely. It’s expected the new bridge will be ready to open in winter 2016/17. The Lustrum Beck food alleviation scheme will reduce the risk of flooding to over 150 homes. The Environment Agency’s Ted Thomas, Project Manager, said: “Work is progressing well on the Lustrum Beck scheme, with the new screen at Primrose Hill now operational and the flood wall at Bedford Street nearly complete. “Work on the embankment at Newtown is well underway, and construction of a new flood wall at Duddon Walk has started ahead of schedule, so we’re hopeful much of the project will be complete by September. “This will all tie in with the previously completed flood wall at Bishopton Road, and the replacement of Londonderry Bridge, which the council is currently working on and which should be complete in the winter. “This overall scheme will bring long-term sustainable benefits to the community by significantly reducing the risk of flooding to over 150 homes and businesses.” Additional work to store extra flood water in the catchment upstream of Stockton and create new habitat is likely to begin in 2017."

/government/news/father-and-son-farmers-fined-for-polluting-somerset-watercourse,"Slurry and silage effluent leaked from a farm into a watercourse inside a Site of Special Scientific Interest at Stoke St Gregory. Father and son farmers fined for polluting Somerset watercourse  Environment Agency A father and son who run a farm in Somerset admitted polluting a watercourse with silage and slurry effluent. The watercourse enters a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) a short distance downstream of the farm. Ben Hembrow of Huntham Farm, in Stoke St Gregory, pleaded guilty to polluting a watercourse and not complying with silage and slurry storage regulations after pollution was traced back to drains on the farm. His father John, pleaded guilty to breaching a discharge permit because farm effluent was discharging in to a watercourse. They were ordered to pay £1,150 in fines and £4,500 costs at Taunton Magistrates Court on 1 August. Ben Hembrow is the majority partner of Huntham Farm and managed the cows. His father John owned and managed the structures. Silage effluent is an acidic liquid produced by the silage process which is a serious pollutant if it drains into a watercourse. Effluent was leaking into the watercourse from an unauthorised silage clamp and cow shed. The unauthorised silage clamp had been built on the farm without Environment Agency approval. A perimeter channel which was cracked had been installed along just one side to direct effluent to a collection chamber. Slurry is a mixture of animal excreta, urine and water. Slurry may also contain quantities of bedding, feed wastes, disinfectants, medication residues, silage and dairy washing waters. Slurry effluent was discharging from a pipe in an earth bank and into a lane before entering the watercourse. The pollution was so bad it spread over 1.5km and triggered alarms in the watercourse. An investigation by the Environment Agency uncovered seriously poor farm management and inadequate infrastructure which had been brought to the defendants’ attention 6 months prior to the incident in November last year. Helen Wintle of the Environment Agency said: We always prefer to work in partnership with our farmers to achieve compliance through advice and guidance. It’s disappointing when the only solution to pollution has to end in prosecution. If you are concerned about pollution to water or land, contact our 24-hour incident line on 0800 807060. Notes to editors Ben Hembrow pleaded guilty to causing an unpermitted water discharge activity, namely the discharge of poisonous, noxious or polluting matter from Huntham Farm, Stoke St Gregory, Somerset into inland fresh waters contrary to Regulations 12(1)(b) and Regulation 38(1)(a) of the Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2010. Fined £410. Ben Hembrow also pleaded guilty to failing to ensure that silage was made and stored in accordance with Regulation 3(1) contrary to Regulation 10(1) of the Water Resources (Control of Pollution) (Silage, Slurry and agricultural Fuel Oil) (England) Regulations 2010. Fined £410 plus £41 victim surcharge. John Hembrow pleaded guilty to breaching condition B (I)(II) and B(II) (III) of a Consent to Discharge dated 1 December 1970 in that it permitted a water discharge activity, namely discharged effluent from the land and premises at Huntham Farm, Stoke St Gregory, Taunton into the tributary of the West Sedgemoor Main Drain containing silage liquor and which exceeded the limit of the biological oxygen demand of 200 parts per million not in accordance with its Consent to Discharge contrary to Regulations 12(1)(b) and 38(2) of the Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2010. Fined £330 plus £33 victim surcharge."

This scheme will reduce the risk of flooding to 230 residential properties from Clifton Street to the Leeds-Liverpool Canal, at a cost of £3.5million. Westleigh Brook has a history of flooding, with properties affected in 2002 and coming close again in 2015. As well as reducing the risk of flooding, the scheme will provide a fish easement and improved access for a local business. The most recent work has included the redirection of gas and water pipes and work on the bridge. Construction of the flood walls will also commence shortly. The Environment Agency recently held a community drop-in session to talk to residents about the ongoing works and help with any concerns they have. The event received some good feedback, with residents feeling positive about the benefits the finished scheme will provide for the local area. Flood Risk Manager for the Environment Agency, Mark Garratt, said: “We appreciate everyone’s patience and support during the construction phase. “The Environment Agency is committed to reducing the risk of flooding and we are pleased to be able to bring forward this scheme and tackle the risk of flooding in this community. “Getting out and speaking to the community is something that we value when constructing major schemes. It’s important that local people are aware of what we are doing and have an opportunity to raise any concerns and feed in their views. We are extremely pleased to hear the positive feedback from residents so far. “We have installed a project notice board and will regularly post project updates such as newsletters and programmes for the local community’s information. “We want to make sure people are kept informed throughout the construction phase and are completely clear about what we’re doing and why we’re doing it.”"

/government/news/yorkshire-water-fined-350000-for-polluting-harrogate-watercourse,"Illegal sewage discharge affected Rud Beck and the River Crimple Yorkshire Water fined £350,000 for polluting Harrogate watercourse  Environment Agency Yorkshire Water has been fined £350,000 for illegally discharging sewage that polluted a Harrogate watercourse. The company was sentenced at Bradford Crown Court yesterday (17 August) after previously pleading guilty to an environmental permitting offence relating to a pollution incident from a sewer overflow near Sherwood Drive, Harrogate in April 2013. At the time, the company had reported a blockage in the sewer that had caused untreated and unscreened sewage to flow into Rud Beck at Sherwood Drive. Inspections by the Environment Agency found that the pollution had a significant impact on Rud Beck and the River Crimple, into which the beck runs. Prosecuting for the Environment Agency, Richard Bradley told the court that toilet rolls and rags could be seen, and the water downstream was a cloudy, yellow-grey colour and smelt strongly of sewage. Samples showed high levels of ammonia and low levels of dissolved oxygen. Yorkshire Water had notified the Environment Agency about the blockage on 15 April 2013 but further investigations revealed that sewage had been discharging from the overflow since 12 April. The company had not responded sooner because its telemetry alarm system, which is used to alert the company to discharges, had been malfunctioning since 15 March and the alarm had not been reset following a previous alarm on 16 March which was triggered by a permitted discharge during high flows. The company had also failed to detect an increase in the telemetry levels on 12 April. A spokesperson for the Environment Agency said: Sewage overflows of this type can be used for discharging effluent into a watercourse, but only in storm situations when water flows are too high for the sewerage system to cope with the increased volume of water. Storm conditions were not present at the time of this incident and untreated sewage entered the beck for 87 hours causing significant pollution affecting over five kilometres of Rud Beck and the Crimple. It is not uncommon for foreign objects to enter a sewer and cause blockages and this is why telemetry is so important. The impact of this discharge would have been significantly less if the telemetry had been working properly or if Yorkshire Water had detected the increase in the telemetry levels and responded sooner. In mitigation, the court heard that Yorkshire Water had not sought to evade its responsibility for the incident. It had self-reported the incident and pleaded guilty at the first opportunity. It had also cooperated with the Environment Agency’s investigation and had organised and paid for the clean-up. The court also heard that a planned telemetry upgrade had gone ahead in May 2013 and the company said that, since the incident, it has introduced a clear escalation procedure for responding to apparent contradictions in its telemetry system. In addition to the fine, Yorkshire Water was ordered to pay £30,000 costs to the Environment Agency."
/government/news/mytholmroyd-residents-invited-to-learn-about-flood-scheme-design,"Working flood model demonstrates flood protection measures Mytholmroyd residents invited to learn about flood scheme design  Environment Agency Residents of Mytholmroyd will be able to experience first-hand how to design and plan a flood scheme, as a huge interactive flood model was delivered to the flood information centre this week. The model recreates a river, into which users can pump water and place obstacles such as bridges and buildings, in order to see how a river would react. Staff at the information centre, which is open to the public on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, are encouraging local people to come and have a go on the model, and ask questions about the new flood scheme planned for Mytholmroyd. Johnny Lyttle, the Environment Agency’s Project Manager for the scheme said: The flood model is good fun and a great way to understand the challenges of planning a flood defence scheme. By putting obstacles such as bridges in different places it is possible to see how every action taken has a consequence somewhere else along the river system – giving a visual insight into the complexities of a river system. We hope that people will come along and try it out, and our experts will be there to answer any questions that they may have about the model and the new flood scheme. A public consultation on the final design of the Mytholmroyd flood defence scheme is due to start in early September, with construction of the scheme set to begin before the end of the year. On Boxing Day 2015 around 370 properties were flooded in Mytholmroyd as extreme rainfall affected the upper Calder Valley. Since then, Environment Agency teams have carried out thousands of inspections, made crucial repairs and constructed temporary defences. A flood action plan for the town was published in May this year setting out plans for permanent improvements to flood protection. The Mytholmroyd Flood Information Centre located in the car park of the community centre, and is open Monday 10am to 4pm, Wednesday 1pm to 7pm and Friday 10am to 4pm."
/government/news/significant-step-forward-for-boston-barrier-flood-defence-scheme,"The Secretary of State will be asked to grant powers to construct and operate the Boston Barrier today. Significant step forward for Boston Barrier flood defence scheme  Environment Agency The Environment Agency will ask the Secretary of State to grant powers to construct and operate the Boston Barrier through a Transport and Works Act Order (TWAO) today. The Boston Barrier scheme is part of a phased approach to reduce the risk of tidal flooding to approximately 14,300 properties in Boston over the next 100 years. Starting today, copies of the submitted TWAO documents will be made available to interested parties and members of the public will be given the opportunity to give their views on the proposals over a period of 6 weeks. The TWAO, if granted, would allow the construction of a new tidal barrier with a moveable gate across the River Witham and a new building to enable operation of the barrier. It would also authorise the construction of new flood defence walls on both banks of the Haven, a replacement gate across the entrance to the existing Port Wet Dock and enable the Environment Agency to execute ancillary works, including dredging of the river. Adam Robinson, Boston Barrier Manager for the Environment Agency, said: The barrier will give the area one of the best standards of tidal flood defence outside of London, so we’d like as many people as possible to see the Transport and Works Act application and talk to us about anything they’re uncertain about.” The barrier will have the ability to control water levels along The Haven in the future, but only once appropriate subsequent approvals and works have been sought and granted. Although Water Level Management (WLM) originally formed a part of the Boston Barrier project, it was agreed by a Lincolnshire County Council Executive Committee in early 2015 that the further work required to take WLM proposals forward should not delay the tidal flood defence project. Cllr Peter Bedford, leader of Boston Borough Council, said: “The main objective for the Boston Barrier has always been to protect this area from flooding. That must remain the main priority. We know all too well from bitter experience that there is no quick fix after flooding. In Boston it took 2 full years of misery and millions of pounds for many to return to anything like normal after the 2013 flood. “In an ideal world, with endless finance, we would have all the bells and whistles. But the priority, now and here and in these cash-strapped times, is whatever we can get which works to protect against flooding as soon as we can get it. “I have every confidence in the experts and professionals from the Environment Agency who tell us that the multimillion pound tidal flood alleviation barrier is the best it can be for Boston at this time; an assurance sought by our MP from ministers and an assurance given. “The fact is that had the barrier been in position in 2013, it would have prevented that flood. It will give among the best protection from tidal flooding of anywhere in the country.” Copies of the relevant documents will be available from today for local inspection at Boston Borough Council offices and the Environment Agency’s Boston Barrier Community Hub for a period of 6 weeks.

/government/news/skinningrove-flood-recovery-work-starts,"Work has started in the village of Skinningrove as part of the Environment Agency’s multi-million pound flood recovery programme.  Skinningrove flood recovery work starts  Environment Agency Repair work in Skinningrove includes channel clearance and replacement and repairs to debris screens on the Kilton Beck, as well as improving access so they can be cleaned and maintained. The work started on Monday, August 22, and is expected to take around three weeks. It’s part of a £3million Environment Agency recovery programme to restore damaged flood defences and recover from storms which hit the North East last winter. Alan Cadas, Environment Agency Operations Manager for the North East, said: “The storms this past winter had a terrible impact on people’s lives, homes and businesses and we’re in the process of carrying out repair works across the North East. “Residents will see us on site in Skinningrove this week and beyond carrying our recovery projects. “Work to get our assets back to the condition they were in prior to the storms is a challenge, but we’re working tirelessly to restore protection to communities.” The Environment Agency is working closely with Northumbrian Water and local authorities to carry out recovery projects. A community event – hosted by the Environment Agency and partners - was held in Skinningrove earlier this year, which included a live Flood Warning Siren test and a demonstration of new flood defences. The event was to help the community be better prepared for flooding. The flood defences in the village were upgraded in a project completed in September 2015, meaning the bridge parapets at Zetland Row now lower automatically at the push of a button, rather than having to be lowered manually. It significantly reduces the time needed to ensure the flood gates are closed and parapets are lowered when river levels are high. The Environment Agency’s Flood Resilience team has been working with residents to finalise a Community Action Plan."
/government/news/jail-for-sussex-waste-boss-who-illegally-stockpiled-over-1200-tonnes-of-wood,"The Environment Agency has prosecuted a Sussex waste criminal who went on the run after dumping over 1,200 tonnes of waste wood for illegal profit on an industrial estate in Uckfield. Jail for Sussex waste boss who illegally stockpiled over 1,200 tonnes of wood  Environment Agency Mr Tom McCabe, aged 32, of Sea Lane in Worthing, West Sussex appeared at Lewes Crown Court on Monday 22 August and pleaded guilty to the offence. He was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment and ordered to pay £3,000 costs. The Court heard that in January 2012, Mr McCabe set up a waste company, Matrix Bio Logistics, specialising in the storage and processing of waste wood with his partner, Miss Kim Box, after leasing land at the Squires Industrial Estate, Easons Green, Uckfield in East Sussex. The Environment Agency granted Mr McCabe a permit exemption for this activity but imposed strict conditions, including a limit of 500 tonnes of wood waste to be on the site in any seven day period. In February that year, just four weeks after the permit was granted, the amount of waste wood stored on site was over 1,200 tonnes, 2.5 times the agreed limit. A notice was served by the Environment Agency requiring Mr McCabe to clear the site but he ignored it, sold the company for £1 and went on the run. As the Environment Agency’s specialist crime officers continued to trace Mr McCabe’s whereabouts, his partner Kim Box was sentenced at Hove Crown Court in July 2015 to a 12-month community order with 200 hours of unpaid work. His Honour Judge Hayward acknowledged Miss Box was not the main operator of the business and that all efforts should be made to find McCabe as he was “a crook”. McCabe was eventually apprehended by Heathrow police officers at the departure gate trying to board a plane to Dubai. The responsibility to clear the site of the huge pile of wood left by McCabe now falls to the landowners and will cost them £100,000 to £200,000 to remove all the waste. Ian Walton of the Environment Agency said: “I am pleased with the verdict as this case sends a clear message to unscrupulous waste operators that crime does not pay and we will take all measures to ensure offenders face justice. As a result of his activities, Mr McCabe left a huge mountain of waste behind which has been a serious blight on the local community.” Whilst passing the custodial sentence, His Honour Judge Hayward said: “This was an appalling tale and took place with no thought for the landowner. He leased the land, took money for the waste and then evaded detection.”"
/government/news/farmer-fined-for-polluting-stream-with-slurry,"A farmer has been ordered to pay £8,957 in fines and costs for polluting a stream near a popular Cornish holiday beach.  Farmer fined for polluting stream with slurry  Environment Agency The case was brought by the Environment Agency. On 9 July 2015 the Environment Agency received a report that the Tywardeath Stream in Par had turned brown and smelt of slurry. Par duck pond was also polluted. As a precaution, warning signs were erected at nearby Par Sands, a designated bathing beach, informing people of the pollution and advising them not to swim in the sea. The pollution was traced to East Lanescot Farm where slurry was gushing from a pipe. Eels and fish were seen in distress gasping for air immediately downstream of the farm. David Phillips, a partner in the company that operates the farm, said as soon as he was alerted he tried to stop the pollution by putting a ‘bung’ in the leaking pipe and started emptying the slurry lagoon with a tanker. When the slurry lagoon was emptied it was discovered a redundant pipe, that flowed under the lagoon, had collapsed and this had caused the pollution. David Phillips estimated that 50,000 gallons of slurry had leaked from the lagoon. He was unaware the slurry had reached the Treesmill Stream, a tributary of the Tywardeath Stream, so hadn’t reported the incident to the Environment Agency. Among fish casualties were 30 brown trout found upstream of Par duck pond and downstream of the farm. In total, more than a kilometre of river was polluted. Magistrates heard there was a similar pollution incident on the farm in 2013. It hadn’t resulted in a prosecution, but the farm was referred to the Catchment Sensitive Farming programme. Had suggested improvements had been carried out following this previous incident, the severity of the 2015 slurry spill would have been reduced. Lisa Goodall for the Environment Agency said: The pollution from this farm had a serious impact on the environment. Hundreds of fish were killed and a local beach was put at risk during the bathing season and. There were significant costs incurred during the clean-up operation. Par duck pond, which is used by recreational fishermen, was badly affected. Appearing before Truro magistrates, David Phillips was fined £675 and ordered to pay £8,214 costs after pleading guilty to an unauthorised discharge of slurry from East Lanescot Farm on 9 July 2015 contrary to Regulations 12(1)(b) and 38(1)(a) of the Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2010."
/government/news/365-million-flood-scheme-begins-in-hull,"Repairs to defences will provide ongoing protection to 63,000 properties £36.5 million flood scheme begins in Hull  Environment Agency The Environment Agency is launching a major flood defence scheme in Hull after securing £36.5 million in Government funding. Work will begin this autumn on repairing flood defences that lie within a 7.5km stretch of the River Hull, helping to protect 63,000 properties in the city. Some 39 riverside locations along the river have been identified as having defences that are in need of repair. These have aged or deteriorated over time, posing a risk of flooding when river levels are high. As part of the first phase of the project, the Environment Agency will repair damaged flood walls and other weak spots to ensure that the existing level of protection will be provided for years to come. Initial surveying and construction work will start in autumn this year. The first phase of the project will be complete by 2019, and additional phases of work will follow. Neil Longden, flood risk manager at the Environment Agency, said: This investment is great news for Hull. It will provide reassurance to a significant number of properties that are at risk of flooding, and on top of that the strengthened defences will open up the river corridor for new development, regeneration and economic growth. The River Hull Defences scheme is a large and complex project. We are working closely with landowners, businesses, river users and Hull City Council to develop the design and the works programme. Floods Minister Thérèse Coffey said: Hull is a fantastic city of great cultural importance and we are absolutely committed to better protecting homes and businesses here, and right across the Humber. This £36.5m scheme is just the start of major flood defence improvements we are making in the area - and by 2021 we will invest a further £86m into the estuary reducing the risk of flooding for more than 50,000 homes. Councillor Alan Clark, Portfolio Holder for Neighbourhoods and Communities at Hull City Council, said: I am delighted that the Government has recognised and committed this crucial investment into flood infrastructure for the city. We are working closely with the Environment Agency to deliver a flood scheme which reduces the risk of flooding from the River Hull for thousands of properties and to improve the river corridor. Defences along the River Hull currently provide a 1-in-200 year protection, meaning that the defences reduce the risk of flooding to a 0.5% chance in any one year. The River Hull is also protected from tidal flooding by the Hull Tidal Surge Barrier, which is located at the confluence of the River Hull and the River Humber. During high tides and storm surges, the barrier is lowered to prevent tidal waters flowing back up the river. In addition to the Environment Agency’s scheme, Hull City Council is continuing to carrying out work to reduce the risk of surface water flooding in the city. Flood defences reduce the risk of flooding, but they do not totally eradicate it. Residents and businesses are urged to sign up for free flood warnings by visiting our flood advice pages or by calling Floodline on 0345 9881188."

Recovery work at Corbridge will be carried out by the Environment Agency and will permanently repair flood defences. The project started on Monday, August 22, and will take place in three locations. At Devils Water a 20 metre scour to the inside of the flood bank will be repaired, with work expected to last until the end of September. At Stanners Bank, the Environment Agency will be repairing 10 metres of bank erosion near to the Cricket Club, and modifying the crest levels of the ramp so it matches the height of the flood wall. There will also be the installation of 6 metre long sheet piles to stabilise the toe of the embankment further down from the Cricket Club. The work near the Cricket Club is expected to last until November 2016. It will permanently repair flood defences to the standard of protection they provided before the winter flooding this past December. The work is part of a £3million Environment Agency recovery programme to restore damaged flood defences. Floods Minister Thérèse Coffey said: “It is fantastic to see Corbridge’s critical flood defences being strengthened once again - showing how determined we are not just to protect the village, but the whole of the North East. “Northumberland is an area of great natural beauty and culture and we’re committed to completing all repairs to defences ahead of the coming winter. That’s why we’re investing £3 million in flood recovery here, to make sure homes and businesses are ready for this winter.” Alan Cadas, Environment Agency Operations Manager for the North East, added: “The storms this past winter had a terrible impact on Corbridge, with 55 homes and businesses flooding, making it one of the worst affected places in the North East. “We carried out initial temporary repairs to flood defences to ensure the town was protected, and we’re now in a position to carry out permanent repairs. “Residents will see us and our contractors on site for the next few months while we carry out the work. “The programme of recovery work, to get our defences back into the condition they were in prior to flooding, is a challenge, but we’re working tirelessly to restore protection to communities.” Tynedale was the North East area most affected by winter floods, which saw record rainfall drop on to already saturated land, leading to some of the highest river levels since 1771. Also in Corbridge, the Environment Agency is planning to remove vegetation from a gravel island in the town, to improve movement of water during high flows. And work to repair flood defences in Tynedale’s Haydon Bridge started at the beginning of August and includes erosion repairs to the banks of the River South Tyne, repairs to Temple Houses flood wall, repairing the flood bank at Martins Close and Rocksprings Crescent and repointing Brigwood flood wall. Since December the Environment Agency, Northumberland County Council and Northumbrian Water have been working together to tackle flooding in the Tyne Valley. This includes repairs to flood defences, sewer network maintenance, repairs to the highways infrastructure and improving community resilience. Work to identify what more can be done to reduce the risk of flooding in affected communities and to increase resilience to flooding is also underway."
/government/news/major-bank-repairs-start-on-the-river-aire,"Work will repair damage caused by the Christmas floods Major bank repairs start on the River Aire  Environment Agency Significant repairs to flood banks along the River Aire in East Yorkshire are currently underway by the Environment Agency, to repair damage done by the Christmas floods and reduce the risk of flooding to local communities. Work is ongoing at Carlton, near Goole, and work has started this week at West Haddlesey to strengthen flood banks. This is part of a package of work along the River Aire costing £7.5m. At Carlton, downstream of the A1021, an 800 metre length of flood bank is being been reinforced using 5 metre steel sheet piles. The bank was suffering from seepage caused by prolonged high water levels from the Christmas floods. The piles have been driven into the bank using heavy machinery, and will stop the bank seeping at high water levels. This week, similar works have started upstream at West Haddlesey where a shorter, 400 metre section of bank needs reinforcing, using sheet piles of 3 metres in length. Lee Riley-Thompson, project manager at the Environment Agency said: The steel sheet piles we are using will be driven as far as possible into the ground, which is a quieter technique we use to minimise any disruption. Due to the nature of the ground some hammering will be required however none of these works are in close proximity to local residents and therefore noise should not be an issue. These works are part of our aim to get all our defences back to standard for the winter season. Further works to reinforce the bank at Temple Hirst using the same techniques, are scheduled to start in September. These repair works are part of the Environment Agency’s asset repair programme, put in place to repair the region’s flood defences which were damaged by the Christmas floods. Officers have checked 8,500 assets and cleared obstructions such as collapsed bridges, buildings, thousands of tonnes of gravel, debris and vehicles from rivers to reduce further flood risk at 150 locations."
/government/news/marlow-flood-alleviation-scheme-drop-in-session,"On 8 September 2016 there will be a drop in session to update local residents on the Marlow flood alleviation scheme. Marlow flood alleviation scheme drop in session  Environment Agency The Environment Agency is holding a public drop in session on Thursday 8 September 2016 for the local community to find out more about the Marlow flood alleviation scheme and the advanced works that will be starting in September 2016. The drop-in session will be held between 4pm and 7.30pm at: The Liston Hall Chapel Street Marlow SL7 1DD There will be information on display and experts on hand to talk about the scheme. The Environment Agency would like to hear how people want to be kept up to date with progress, and there will be the chance to sign up to a distribution list. David Bedlington, Area Flood and Coastal Risk Manager for the Environment Agency said: I am delighted that the advanced works for the flood defences in Marlow are able to start this year. One flood wall will replace timber fences with a permanent and impermeable wall, along the boundaries of 2 residential properties. The second flood wall will prevent the River Thames from backing up along the highway ditch near the A404. These walls are part of the preparation for the main scheme which is expected to start construction in spring 2017. I look forward to meeting members from the local community on 8 September. The advanced works will consist of building 2 flood walls between 1.5 metres and 2 metres in height, and made from concrete with a brick finish. One will be adjacent to the towpath between Gossmore recreation ground and Pergola field. The other will be on the highway ditch at the rear of Firview Close. The advanced works will be complete by the end of December 2016. The towpath between Gossmore recreation ground and Pergola field will be closed for the duration of the works. The advanced works will allow the Environment Agency to effectively use temporary defence barriers to reduce the risk of flooding to Marlow, until the main scheme is completed. Due to reduced space and access constraints, temporary barriers could not be placed in the two locations of the advanced works. The Environment Agency is able to deploy temporary defence barriers across England, when and where there is an identified risk of property flooding. Eventually, the advanced works will form part of the main Marlow flood alleviation scheme. The Environment Agency is continuing to progress plans to build the main Marlow flood alleviation scheme. Work is continuing on: ecological surveys at Pound Lane and Lower Pound Lane - these will continue into the autumn of 2016 finalising the existing design discussing land use with landowners The Environment Agency expects the main construction of the scheme to begin in spring 2017, subject to all legal and land requirements being finalised. The Marlow flood alleviation scheme will reduce flood risk to 287 properties in Marlow from a combination of fluvial (river) and groundwater flooding. All media enquiries: 0800 917 9259."
/government/news/exeter-flood-defence-scheme-works-to-start-in-exwick,"How playing fields will be affected during construction of the second phase of Exeter's flood defence scheme.  Exeter flood defence scheme works to start in Exwick  Environment Agency Work gets underway on a new flood embankment around Exwick playing fields next week (5 September). The work, which aims to reduce flood risk to properties behind the playing fields, is part of the second phase of Exeter’s flood defence scheme. Two out of the three playing fields will remain open during the works but the third playing field, which is closest to the health centre, will be used to stockpile material and provide onsite facilities until the embankment is complete. Although the construction is expected to be completed by spring 2017, the playing field will need to be kept out of use until it is restored to its previous condition. Work will be carried out in stages and to help deliver these, contractor BMM will need to access the playing fields from several locations. For this reason, part of the footpath along the edge of the playing fields will be closed at different times. A letter explaining what is happening has gone out to around 500 residents living close to the playing fields and signs will be erected around the site as work progresses. Exeter City Council owns the playing fields. Councillor Rachel Sutton, Lead Councillor for City Development, said: To minimise disruption to residents, work has specifically been timetabled to start after children have returned to school at the end of the summer holidays. Stockpiling material in one playing field will minimise vehicle movements across the city as all construction material will be on site. Phase 2 of Exeter’s £32 million scheme, which started in July, aims to reduce flood risk to 3,200 homes and businesses. Work is progressing well, with 25,000 tonnes of material already being moved from Bromham’s Farm to Cowley field. Investigation work has been carried out at the Quay to check the precise location of utilities such as power cables and gas pipes. Construction work on new demountable flood defences will then start in November – avoiding the busy summer season. By Christmas, work will also have begun around Bonhay Road and Okehampton Road. Phase 1 of the scheme got underway in 2014 and saw construction work just downstream of Exeter Quay. The Trew’s flood relief channel and the side spill weir at the top of the channel have been lowered. This increased the flow capacity of the flood relief channel, which will help reduce flood risk during high river flows. The check weir at the downstream end of the flood relief channel will be removed later in 2016 to increase flow capacity further. Exeter City Council and Devon County Council each contributed £3 million to the scheme. £6 million has come from government growth funding and the remainder is being funded by flood defence grant in aid. The project offices are located in Bromham’s field. People are welcome to visit the offices if they have any questions or would like to meet the site team.

/government/news/medmerry-showcased-at-the-iucn-world-conservation-congress,"The Environment Agency’s innovative flood defence scheme in Medmerry is being showcased at the IUCN World Conservation Congress in Hawaii. Medmerry showcased at the IUCN World Conservation Congress  Environment Agency The Environment Agency’s innovative flood defence scheme in West Sussex, ‘Medmerry’, is being showcased at the IUCN World Conservation Congress in Hawaii this week (w/c 5 September 2016). Held every 4 years, the IUCN World Conservation Congress helps shape the future direction of conservation and sustainable development. As well as being presented as a case study for nature-based solutions, the multi-award winning scheme has also been selected to form part of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) 2016 report. The Congress - which brings together several thousand leaders and decision-makers from government, civil society, indigenous peoples, business, and academia - will hear that Medmerry was completed in 2014. Its innovative design was based around the latest thinking on natural flood management techniques, but also incorporated 4 miles (7 kilometres) of new sea embankments. Together, these measures have significantly reduced coastal flood risk to hundreds of local properties as well as protecting the key infrastructure for the town of Selsey. The defences have been hailed as a gold standard of flood defence in the UK *. James Humphrys, Environment Agency Area Manager, said: I am delighted to see Medmerry forming part of the IUCN’s report. Schemes such as this protect people and property from flooding, as well as creating large scale, good quality habitat for the benefit of numerous wildlife species. It is an honour to be linked with IUCN, and I look forward to meeting in December with Stewart Maginnis, IUCN’s Global Director of the Forest and Climate Change Programme, to discuss how, by working together, we can create solutions for society and the environment. Medmerry created a new wetland for local wildlife with 183 hectares of intertidal coastal habitat for wading birds and potentially endangered species, including the water vole. Much of the site is now managed by the RSPB as a nature reserve. This new form of defence has helped to save £300,000 taxpayers’ money each year (the cost of constantly repairing/maintaining the shingle bank during the winter months). It also supports local economic growth by allowing businesses to operate all year round, and encouraging ‘green’ tourism. The IUCN is uniquely composed of both government and civil society organisations. It provides public, private and non-governmental organisations with the knowledge and tools that enable human progress, economic development and nature conservation to take place together. Stewart Maginnis, Global Director of the Nature-based Solutions Group at the International Union for the Conservation of Nature said: Ecosystems and the way they are managed, restored and conserved, present real solutions to societal problems such as climate change, food and water security, and in reducing disaster risk. IUCN considers that the coastal realignment in Medmerry perfectly illustrates how nature-based solutions principles come together to deliver tangible, cost-effective benefits for society and nature. Created in 1948, IUCN has evolved into the world’s largest and most diverse environmental network. It harnesses the experience, resources and reach of its 1,300 member organisations and the input of some 16,000 experts. IUCN is the global authority on the status of the natural world and the measures needed to safeguard it. Its experts are organised into 6 commissions dedicated to species survival, environmental law, protected areas, social and economic policy, ecosystem management, and education and communication. *Since its completion (November 2013) Medmerry has won the following awards: APM Project Manager of the year - highly commended BCI Project of the Year 2014 - winner Prime Ministers Award (nominated by BCI) - winner CIEEM Practical Conservation - winner CIEEM Stakeholder Engagement - winner CIEEM Tony Bradshaw Special Award - winner CIPR Pride 2012 and 2014 Community Relations Campaign Silver Awards Considerate Constructor - silver Constructing Excellence Innovation - winner Constructing Excellence Sustainability - highly commended Green Apple Sustainability - bronze ICE SE Engineering Excellence - winner IBP PR and Communications Integrated Project of the Year 2014 - winner Environment Agency Project Excellence Sustainable Resource Manager - winner RICS Infrastructure - winner RICS Design through Innovation - winner RICS - Project of the Year - winner"

/government/news/environment-agency-chief-executive-visits-boston-barrier-site,"The Boston Barrier will provide one of the best defences outside of London Environment Agency Chief Executive visits Boston Barrier site  Environment Agency Chief Executive of the Environment Agency, Sir James Bevan, visited the Boston Barrier Community Hub on Wednesday, 31 August, to lend his support to the flood defence project. Sir James took the opportunity to come and speak to the project board and local stakeholders including MP Matt Warman and Chief Executive of Boston Borough Council, Phil Drury. The project, which recently received attention following the submission of a Transport & Works Act order application, is projected to reduce the risk of tidal flooding to approximately 14,300 properties in Boston over the next 100 years. The project team has applied to the Secretary of State for an order granting a range of powers to put the scheme into practice under the Transport and Works Act. The public have until 5 October to make representations to the Secretary of State who will then decide whether the scheme will be brought to a public inquiry. Sir James said: “I felt it was essential to come and see the Boston Barrier team at such an important milestone. I’ve seen the devastating effects flooding can have on communities and so I’m looking forward to the barrier being in place as it will provide one of the best defences against tidal flooding anywhere outside of London. “I am confident in the work of the project team and I believe we have come up with the best barrier in the best place to give the best protection for Boston. “The local economy will benefit too as, where you have better protection against floods, businesses are more likely to invest, developers are more likely to build and tourism is likely to increase.” Matt Warman, MP for Boston & Skegness, met with Sir James Bevan during his visit to Boston and discussed the flood defence project and the future potential for Water Level Management, creating increased opportunities for tourism and leisure craft. Matt said: “I am delighted that the Boston Barrier will provide the highest level of flood protection to Boston. “This project will be one of the largest ever delivered by the Environment Agency and demonstrates the Government’s commitment to safeguarding our area’s homes and businesses. “Importantly, the project will secure increased flood protection as soon as possible whilst still protecting options for future water level management. That means it will fast-track the increased protection from flooding and still offer huge potential for future economic growth. “I hope that the local community will join me in supporting this project through making written representations to the Secretary of State. Details of how to do so are on my website.” Copies of the Transport and Works Act order application and relevant documents will be available for local inspection at Boston Borough Council’s offices and the Environment Agency’s Boston Barrier Community Hub until 5 October 2016.

/government/news/construction-begins-on-faversham-flood-alleviation-scheme,"The Environment Agency begins work today on the Front Brents flood alleviation scheme at Faversham. Construction begins on Faversham flood alleviation scheme  Environment Agency Following flooding to properties in the Front Brents area of Faversham during unusually high tides of December 2013, the Environment Agency has been working in partnership with residents, Swale Borough Council, Faversham Town Council and Kent County Council to design a scheme which significantly reduces flood risk to those properties affected by flooding. The works will consist of a clay embankment between 600mm and 800mm high. The embankment will be landscaped and will include openings to allow continued public access to the green and the creek itself. These openings will be sealed by timber flood barriers when required. The construction work is expected to last for 2 months. Mark Douch, Environment Manager for the Environment Agency, said: When the works are complete, over 30 residences and businesses will benefit from protection against tidal flooding. By working in partnership with local residents and local authorities, we have developed a cost effective scheme which is sympathetic to the local environment. On average, for every £1 invested in protecting communities, £8 is saved in damage repair. It is our priority to do everything we can to protect people from flooding. This year the Environment Agency is on track to better protect 44,000 properties in England through its continued programme of investment in flood defence schemes. We are spending more than £2.3 billion to build flood schemes around the country, which will better protect 300,000 homes by 2021."
/government/news/flood-risk-expert-retires-after-40-years,"A Norfolk-based flood risk veteran, who played a key role in the aftermath of the East Coast surge in 2013, is retiring after 40 years. Flood risk expert retires after 40 years  Environment Agency Steve Hayman has worked for the Environment Agency (and its predecessor organisations) for 40 years, covering a range of roles including managing river and sea defence projects, mainly across Norfolk, Suffolk and Essex. Steve, a chartered civil engineer, who is currently senior coastal advisor, said: I feel very fortunate that I was entrusted with a range of important engineering works, which included the Colne Barrier in Essex and major sea and tidal defence schemes at Heacham/Hunstanton, Wells, Sea Palling, Great Yarmouth, Aldeburgh, Felixstowe, Parkeston and Clacton/Jaywick. Since 2010, his role has been liaising with local authorities and other organisations to implement sustainable policies along the Norfolk coast. Steve believes the biggest change over the years has been the advances in technology, which has improved the service the EA provides, especially when it comes to dealing with flooding incidents. He said: My early introduction to the risks we face around our coast was a major tidal surge in January 1978. The extent of the flood risk only really became apparent as we monitored the rising tide about 4 hours before high water at Wells. Even then, our ability to warn members of the public relied mainly on limited telephone communication with the local police. By comparison, in a similar event we experienced in December 2013, with the benefit of accurate computer forecasts, we were preparing with our partners days in advance of the flood itself. We were able to keep people informed through the local media and by regularly updating flooding predictions on our website and we also now have the capability to issue warnings directly to households within areas at risk. The East coast surge in December 2013 was the most serious event of its kind in 60 years. Unfortunately 500 homes and businesses were flooded across Norfolk, Suffolk and Essex but the advances in flood warning and improvements made to the sea defences prevented the devastating consequences experienced in 1953. EA defences protected more than 68,000 properties. Steve was heavily involved taking part in media interviews throughout the day and night. Subsequently he took on the role of flood ambassador for Norfolk, working with affected communities, local authorities and partners for up to a year after the event. He said it is his colleagues he will miss the most, and retirement will consist of tackling long-promised jobs around the house and garden, as well managing two small building projects. Mark Johnson, Area Coastal Manager, said: Steve has given 40 years loyal service to the EA and its predecessor organisations. He is a true gentleman and font of coastal knowledge. The trust he has built up with partners is something for all to aspire to. We all wish Steve a long and healthy retirement."
/government/news/negligent-averies-brothers-plead-guilty,"In a case brought by the Environment Agency, Company Directors Lee and David Averies have pleaded guilty to breaching environmental regulations. Negligent Averies brothers plead guilty  Environment Agency In a case brought by the Environment Agency, Company Directors Lee and David Averies have pleaded guilty today (Friday 30 September) at Swindon Crown Court to breaching environmental regulations at their waste sites, Swindon Skips Ltd (SSL) at Brindley Close, Cheney Manor, and Averies Recycling Swindon Ltd (ARSL) at Marshgate in Swindon, Wiltshire. In addition Calne Aggregate Holdings Ltd pleaded guilty to breaching environmental regulations at its waste site in Calne, Wiltshire. Lee Averies is a director of Calne Aggregates Holdings Ltd. The guilty pleas for all 3 sites relate to the treating, keeping or disposing of waste in a manner likely to cause pollution of the environment or harm to human health. The charges cover the period when 2 large fires ignited at their sites in Brindley Close and Marshgate in November 2013 and July 2014 respectively. The charges at the Calne site related to breaches of their permit which increased the risk of pollution and harm to human health and in particular the risk of polluting run-off from the waste especially in the event of a fire. The fire at Brindley Close burnt for a week and smouldered for some time further, causing major disruption to the local business community and delays on the nearby First Great Western main railway line. The second fire at the Marshgate site was even more significant, burning for 57 days until mid-September 2014. Local businesses and residents were disrupted and affected by smoke. ARSL did not comply with the notices served on them during the incident to remove sufficient waste to enable Wiltshire Fire and Rescue Service to tackle the blaze. Since the fire at the Marshgate site the Environment Agency took the action of removing the waste carriers licence from ARSL, which meant that the company could no longer collect waste from local businesses or residents. Environmental permits were also revoked at both sites which prevented waste being accepted until the risk of serious pollution was removed. Colin Chiverton, Area Environment Manager for the Environment Agency said: The Environment Agency has worked hard to minimise the environmental impacts as a result of David Averies’ negligent, and Lee Averies’, reckless mis-management of the site. Working in partnership with local authorities, the fire service and Network Rail meant that the impact to the community and environment had been significantly reduced. Our officers and contractors worked around the clock to remove waste from the site when the fires broke out to ensure the fire service had the space to extinguish the fires. Lee and David Averies will be sentenced on 26 October 2016. All media enquiries 0800 917 9259"
/guidance/waste-incinerator-plant-apply-for-ri-status,"How to calculate the incinerator’s energy efficiency factor so you can apply for and keep R1 recovery status.  Waste incinerator plant: apply for R1 status  Environment Agency Incinerating waste is a disposal activity. You can re-class your incinerator as a recovery operation if you get R1 status. Your incineration plant may need R1 recovery status if it’s a requirement of your planning approval. Your plant must have R1 status if you want to: be an accredited reprocessor for packaging recover automotive shredder residue ( ASR ) – the material left over from the end of life vehicle recycling process Check if the incinerator is eligible To qualify as an R1 recovery operation the waste incinerator must: have or will have an environmental permit for a waste incineration installation be capable of incinerating mixed municipal solid waste not be a co-incinerator Find out what mixed municipal waste is and what to do if your waste incinerator has more than one incineration line in the European Commission’s guidance . Municipal waste incinerators ( MWI ) designed to burn municipal waste but which accept commercial and industrial waste are also eligible. Calculate the energy efficiency You must calculate the energy efficiency factor of the incinerator. This is known as the R1 value. Calculate the R1 value using the method in the European Commission’s Guidance . If your incineration plant will generate electricity using a standard Rankine cycle steam power plant system, you can use the R1 efficiency formula spreadsheet to do the calculation. If you’re not sure if the spreadsheet is suitable for your process contact the Environment Agency for advice. Energy efficiency results The minimum R1 values are: 0.60 for MWI permitted and in operation before 1 January 2009 0.65 for MWI permitted and in operation after 31 December 2008 0.60 for ASR If the first R1 value you calculate is below the minimum, you can apply a climate correction factor ( CCF ). This may help increase the R1 value for plants in warmer parts of the UK where it’s harder to be efficient than in colder parts. Calculate your CCF You must follow the instructions in the Annex of European Commission Directive (EU) 2015/1127 . You can enter the CCF value into the R1 spreadsheet which will then calculate the final R1 value automatically. Or you can multiply the R1 value you’ve calculated with the CCF yourself. Apply for R1 status Before you make an application you can have a pre-application discussion with your local Environment Agency installations team. This will help you understand what you need to include in your application. Contact the Environment Agency to arrange this. You must submit: the R1 value, either in a completed R1 spreadsheet, or alternative calculation method agreed with the Environment Agency if your incinerator doesn’t use a standard Rankine cycle steam power plant system clear concise evidence for each figure a Sankey diagram (or equivalent) showing the boundary of the system you’re doing the calculation for the correct fee The Environment Agency will assess the data you submit and confirm if you meet R1 status. Apply before the plant is commissioned Once the plant design is known you can submit an application based on design data. You can apply before the plant has been commissioned including before you seek planning approval or apply for an environmental permit. You can also apply for R1 status at the same time as making an environmental permit application. If you do this it will be cheaper than making separate applications. Apply when the plant is commissioned When a new incinerator plant is commissioned it’ll have an acceptance test to show that it meets the design specifications. Your application must use the boiler efficiency data from the acceptance test to validate the R1 value you calculated at the design stage. If you don’t, or if the value is below the minimum needed, you’ll lose R1 status. Apply after the plant has been commissioned If you didn’t apply for R1 status using the plant design you can still apply after the plant’s been commissioned. Contact the Environment Agency to find what to do if the acceptance test was carried out more than 5 years ago. Maintain R1 status You must collect operational data each year. You must submit a revised R1 application based on this data by the end of the following January. The Environment Agency will assess the data and confirm whether you’re still achieving R1 status. If the data shows that you’re not achieving R1 status at the end of the year you can ask for more time to take action to fix the problem.

/government/news/temporary-bridge-on-a39-to-be-removed-during-one-day-road-closure,"Somerset traffic diversion will be in place for 24 hours while engineers remove structure. Temporary bridge on A39 to be removed during one-day road closure  Environment Agency The A39 in Cannington, Somerset, will be closed for roadworks while the Environment Agency removes a temporary bridge. The bridge allowed engineers from Team Van Oord to create a flood alleviation channel beneath the road to improve the flood defence of around 200 homes in Cannington. To remove the bridge, the A39 will be closed for 24 hours at that location. The closure takes effect 7pm on Saturday 8 October. A diversion route will be in place. Dan Boswell, project manager, of the Environment Agency, said: We are very grateful to residents of Cannington and commuters in the area who have been very patient with the roadworks. The use of a temporary bridge to keep traffic flowing without need for traffic lights or road closures, which would otherwise have been in place for months, was a great innovation. Now we are at the stage where the bridge needs to be removed and we will use overnight on the weekend to minimise inconvenience. We ask for residents’ and commuters’ patience one last time while this goes ahead. Flood defence work began in April and is due to be finished in the early new year. The completion of the defence scheme will mean the standard of flood protection is greatly improved for homes and businesses in the village to at least a 100 year standard. This means only a 1% chance of flood happening in any year. The village itself has a long history of flooding from the Cannington Brook. In November 2012, more than 40 properties were flooded twice within a matter of days. In 1984, a small flood alleviation channel was built to reduce flows through the centre of the village. However investigations have shown that the channel will not be sufficient to deal with current and future flood flows."

/government/news/virtual-test-to-ensure-river-aire-moveable-weir-is-winter-ready,"Virtual testing takes place on the River Aire as part of the Leeds flood alleviation scheme.  Virtual test to ensure River Aire moveable weir is winter ready  Environment Agency The Environment Agency has carried out a virtual test to ensure work to install a moveable weir on the River Aire is winter ready. Installation of the weir at Crown Point, a first for UK flood alleviation, is just one element that Leeds City Council, in partnership with the Environment Agency, is delivering as part of Phase 1 of the Leeds flood alleviation scheme. The virtual test was carried out on Thursday 20 October. Half the river was blocked earlier in the year when 1,500 tonnes of rock was dropped into the channel. The rock was used to create a platform for heavy plant vehicles needed to drive in sheet piles to create a dry working space. Once the space was created work to remove the existing weir could begin. As the normal width of the river has had to be reduced for the work to go ahead, a penstock has been installed in the fish pass at the side of the weir. The penstock essentially acts as a gate to manage water levels. Crucially, it is used to mitigate the risk of flooding during the construction phase of the moveable weir. When raised, upstream river levels can be lowered when high flows are expected in the river. Jonathan Moxon, catchment director for the Upper Aire at the Environment Agency said: “We are doing an exercise with Leeds City Council to ensure the procedures that we have jointly agreed to operate the penstock run smoothly. The council’s contractors, BAM Nuttall, will be working with Environment Agency staff to respond to a simulated flood event in Leeds. “A vital part of increasing our resilience to flooding is ensuring we are prepared to respond to any flooding this coming winter. The exercise we’re carrying out today will test our incident planning and response.” Further downstream, work to replace Knostrop Weir is well underway with the third weir gate now being installed. Once complete, the moveable weirs at Crown Point and Knostrop will be capable of lowering river levels during flood conditions. Elsewhere, the majority of the flood walls on the River Aire are now complete. This includes glazed flood panels in locations such as the former KPMG building and Victoria Quays. Work to install flood defences along Hol Beck has now started. Full details of Leeds flood scheme can be found here"

The floodgates are located across the Jaywick frontage. There may be other repairs going on in the local area. The work started in early October and will last for up to 12 weeks. The floodgates will be removed for short periods of time when the tides are at their lowest. The floodgates require regular maintenance to ensure they work effectively during high tides. Essex Operations Officer Naomi Drown says: We are repairing the wall in front of the Brooklands estate, and undertaking routine maintenance work on the Jaywick floodgates. These repairs are important for reducing the flood risk to the area. We will remove each floodgate to do necessary maintenance and repairs, before putting it back in place. For the Brooklands flood defence wall we will be doing patch repairs to the damaged concrete. During this time there will be operatives working in the road adjacent to the Brooklands wall, however the road will remain open. We will normally be working between 7:30am and 5pm The seawall and the floodgates provide a high standard of flood protection to the people and property of Jaywick. The work is occurring during the Flood Action campaign, organised by the Environment Agency, which aims to increase the number of people who check their flood risk.

/government/news/works-to-reduce-flood-risk-in-exeter-continue-on-bonhay-road-and-at-the-quay,"Further works to reduce flood risk to over 3,200 homes and businesses around Exeter get underway this month. Works to reduce flood risk in Exeter continue on Bonhay Road and at the Quay  Environment Agency The works, which are part of the second phase of construction for Exeter’s new £32 million flood defence scheme, focus on the Quayside and Bonhay Road. Exeter Quay From 7 November 2016, BMM JV, working on behalf of the Environment Agency, will divert cables and water mains on the Quayside to make way for the installation of concrete piles to support the flood gates outside the waterfront. Work will also start on temporary defences – barriers that can be put up when flooding is likely – which follow the line of the existing bollards at the quay. New bollards will hold the barriers in place during a flood. Foundations for this work will need a lot of space – so large excavation notices will be put in place. Cobbles and existing paving will be reinstated. Work will also start to build a flood wall on the Piazza Terracina. Access to all areas of the quay will remain open during works but there will be localised diversions in place at times to achieve this. During winter 2017/18, flood defences around Quay Bridge and the Samuel Jones pub area will be completed. Some disruption will be experienced during this time but the quay will remain open throughout works. Richard Cox, for the Environment Agency said: We continue to build the flood defences in a way which minimises disruption to those living, working and visiting Exeter. We have listened to traders and business owners to plan this work in the least intrusive way possible. Councillor Stuart Hughes, Devon County Council’s cabinet member for highway management and flood prevention said: Flooding can have a devastating impact on people’s lives. Overall, this vital scheme will reduce flood risk to more than 3,000 homes and businesses in Exeter. We understand that quay residents want to know what is being done and why and how it will affect them. This is why we have been talking to businesses, a dedicated phone line and email was set up and updates have been posted on social media. Bonhay Road On 5 November construction starts on a 120 metre concrete flood wall on Bonhay Road. 60 metre of the wall will be adjacent to Bonhay Road. To carry out this work safely a 2-way traffic light system will be used during weekdays, 9am to 4.30pm. Councillor Hughes added: We have done everything possible to minimise the impact on road users. We understand traffic restrictions are an inconvenience but they are essential in order for us to ensure we can complete this vital work. We hope by limiting our work to these hours we can reduce the impact we have on the busiest times of day. Councillor Rachel Sutton, Exeter City Council’s Lead Councillor for City Development, said: The scheme has made excellent progress to date. Working together, the Environment Agency, Exeter City Council and Devon County Council have developed plans so that the scheme can be built with minimal disruption to residents and local businesses. As part of the works, a large tree which is growing within the footprint of the new wall’s foundations are being constructed will need to be removed. To do this safely, Bonhay Road will be closed on the following dates: Saturday 5 November, 11.30am to 6pm Sunday 6 November, 7.30am to 6pm Saturday 12 November and Sunday 13 November, 7.30am to 6pm Diversions will be in place at these times. The works on Bonhay Road are expected to be complete by April 2017.

/government/publications/great-yarmouth-outer-harbour,"Report on the construction of the Great Yarmouth Outer Harbour. Great Yarmouth Outer Harbour  Marine Management Organisation Construction of Great Yarmouth Outer Harbour ( GYOH ) was permitted under powers granted by the Great Yarmouth Outer Harbour Act 1986 and subsequent HROs. The Harbour Revision Orders ( HRO ) were made by the Department for Transport ( DfT ) in 2005. A licence under the Food and Environment Protection Act 1985 ( FEPA ) was issued by the marine and Fisheries Agency ( MFA ) for the marine works in 2007. Construction of GYOH was completed in 2012. In 2011, FEPA licence became a deemed marine licence. In 2010, Marine Management Organisation ( MMO ) became aware of local press reports attributing an increase in erosion to the construction of GYOH and began a review of the monitoring, in 2011 the MMO commissioned Cefas to undertake a desk-based study entitled “ Shoreline variability in the vicinity of the Great Yarmouth Outer Harbour ”(issued 9 march 2012). The 2011 report concluded that: there is a build-up of sediment to the north of GYOH that could be due to the presence of the Outer Harbour the change in accretion rate at Gorleston is coincident with port construction and requires further investigation to determine cause and effect the erosion in the Hopton area is persistent over the last 20 years, shows no change following GYOH construction and is therefore not an impact of the GYOH . The report recommended further investigation work to be undertaken. In 2014 the MMO commissioned Cefas to undertake a further, more detailed study entitled “ The Impacts of the Construction of Great Yarmouth Outer Harbour on Coastal Evolution ”. This study involved use of a numerical model to establish potential changes to sediment transport pathways and any resultant potential impacts on the section of coastline between Winterton-on-Sea and Lowestoft, driven by the introduction of GYOH . In summary, this report has concluded that the construction of GYOH has had a direct impact upon waves and tidal currents, and hence coastal processes, in the local area, however such impacts are limited to a distance of approximately 1.5 km north and south of GYOH . These findings are in line with the conclusions reached in the 2011 Cefas report, and are also broadly in line with predictions made in the document “Great Yarmouth Outer Harbour Development: Environmental Statement” published in May 1997. In conclusion the 2014 report has provided no evidence of a plausible mechanism for impacts upon coastal processes as a result of the presence of the GYOH to occur in areas outwith 1.5km from the GYOH ."

Master and owner ordered to pay over £102,000 for illegal mackerel catch  Marine Management Organisation On 6 March 2015 at Bodmin Magistrates courts the master and owner of the Dutch registered trawler Frank Bonefaas SCH-72 were each convicted following guilty pleas after being charged by the Marine Management Organisation ( MMO ) with illegally retaining on board mackerel deemed to have been caught in the mackerel box. Fishing vessels seeking to fish in this area of the sea are required to provide a minimum of 24 hours’ notice prior to entering the area and to inform the MMO of the total quantities of mackerel on-board prior to entering. Vessels equipped with regulated fishing gears are then limited to catches which are made up of not more than 15% of mackerel The court heard how the vessel, a 119.65 metre pelagic trawler had, between 22 February 2014 and 13 March 2014, entered the mackerel box and fished for mackerel and other species without previously notifying the MMO . The vessel was boarded on 13 March 2014 by Royal Navy fishery protection officers from HMS Severn. The catch was inspected and the vessel was found to have 632,166 kgs of mackerel on board which was all deemed to have been caught inside the mackerel box. The court heard that the value of the catch was in the region of £436,557. The court fined the master, Piet Hoek of Katwijle aan Zee, Netherlands £15,000 and ordered a payment of a victim surcharge of £120 and £125.88 towards the costs of the prosecution. The Dutch company which owns the vessel, Diepzee Visserij Maatschappij Cornelis Vrolijk II BV, was ordered to pay £38,000, a victim surcharge of £120 and prosecution costs of £5,000. Additionally, the owner was ordered to pay a fine of 10% of the value of the fish (£43,650). Note: The MMO has amended the first paragraph of the above statement to help clarify the fact that it was the defendants’ failure to notify the MMO of any on board mackerel catch prior to entering the mackerel box which meant that on inspection all of the catch was deemed by law to have been caught in the mackerel box. The MMO considers the original statement read in its entirety to be factually correct and accurate, but we are happy to make this amendment by way of clarification."

/government/news/protecting-our-natural-world,"We can all play our part to protect our natural world. Protecting our natural world  Marine Management Organisation Over millions of years, natural life has evolved to live together in communities. In the different regions of the world – on land and in seas – there are different natural communities with distinct characteristics. If animals, including fish and birds, or plants, from a distant community get into the UK or its seas, they may not fit harmoniously into the local natural community. For example, American lobsters and Dungeness crabs live in communities off the coast of North America. Some of these non-native creatures were released into the sea near Brighton in June 2015. There’s a risk that such non-native species could spread quickly, establishing breeding populations. These could threaten the UK’s native lobsters and crabs by introducing diseases to which they have little resistance or by out-competing them for food and shelter. Any loss of our native lobsters and crabs could seriously affect the livelihoods of individual fishermen and the viability of local businesses. Losses would also disrupt the wider marine ecosystem. Following the release near Brighton, fishermen have been trying to catch the American lobsters and Dungeness crabs to minimise damage to the communities of native crabs and lobsters they rely on for their income. In the interests of protecting the natural environment, it is a criminal offence in the UK to release non-native species into the wild. This includes mammals, birds, fish, amphibians, lobsters and crabs, as well as plant communities. The release of any non-native species can cause the death of native species through competition or disease. Releasing native species, for example European lobsters and brown crabs into the seas around the UK means that they fit into the local sealife community. Anyone wanting to release lobsters, crabs, or any other species, should first check that they are species that will live harmoniously in the UK’s natural communities."

/government/news/man-found-guilty-of-marine-licensing-offences-relating-to-salvage-of-shipwreck,"Tin ingots valued in excess of £50,000 were removed during unlawful salvage operations off the north coast of Cornwall. Man found guilty of marine licensing offences relating to salvage of shipwreck  Marine Management Organisation On 20 May 2016, Mr Neil Isherwood of Bury, Lancashire was sentenced to a community order with 150 hours of unpaid work after being found guilty of a marine licensing offence by a jury at Newcastle upon Tyne Crown Court. The court heard how Mr Isherwood was one of two responsible for the unlawful removal of tin ingots which were valued in excess of £50,000 from the shipwreck of the SS Cheerful, a cargo ship which sunk in 1885 off the north coast of Cornwall. The defendant, together with Mr Henk de Bloeme, a Dutch national and the owner of the Panamanian registered vessel Bela, had set off from Holland on 15 July 2013 and over the course of the next fortnight visited a number of wrecks situated around the coast of the United Kingdom. On 1 August 2013, the MV Bela was intercepted by HMS Severn and boarded by marine officers from the Marine Management Organisation (MMO) working with the Royal Navy. On board, the officers identified a quantity of tin ingots which further investigation revealed had been salvaged from the wreck of the SS Cheerful. Further investigation also revealed that the defendants did not have a marine licence authorising the removal. Under the Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009, a marine licence is required for the removal of any substance or object from the sea bed in the UK marine area using a vehicle, vessel or other marine structure. In English waters, the MMO is the licensing authority. The court also heard how Mr De Bloeme had previously pleaded guilty to the offence at North Tyneside Magistrates’ Court on 29 May 2015 for which he received a £2,000 fine and was ordered to pay a proportion of the prosecution costs. Mr Isherwood, who told the court he was a self-employed cargo recovery consultant based in Manchester, had previously pleaded not guilty to the offences and asked that the case be tried by the Crown Court. After a four day trial in Newcastle the jury returned a unanimous guilty verdict. Sentencing Mr Isherwood the Recorder of Newcastle, His Honour Judge Sloan QC, said: “I have no doubt that you played a leading role in this exercise. The offence was committed deliberately and I am satisfied that you attempted to conceal your activities.” In bringing this prosecution, the MMO was supported by Royal Navy officers from the Fisheries Protection Squadron who took part in the boarding of the vessel and provided valuable evidence to the court. The prosecution was also supported by Historic England, from whom Dr Christopher Pater gave expert evidence as to the provenance and historic value of the tin ingots which were salvaged from the wreck and also told the court of the harm that can be caused to sites of important archaeological value from unregulated salvage activities. Dr Christopher Pater, Head of Marine Planning for Historic England said: “This has been an important case for Historic England to support the Marine Management Organisation because it is essential that when individuals target historic shipwrecks for unlawful salvage, we can provide vital information about how a wreck like the SS Cheerful is part of our shared heritage. The SS Cheerful dates from a time when steam power was replacing sail and tin ingot smelting in Cornwall was an active industry, so it is a loss to us all if sites like this are picked apart and the wreck and its contents lost piece by piece.” The MMO endeavours to achieve compliance with marine licensing requirements through a number of responses in accordance with its compliance and enforcement strategy. Guidance is available on the MMO website on the process of obtaining a licence and the MMO encourages people who have queries to make contact if further guidance is required. This case demonstrates the MMO’s determination to try and prevent unlawful salvage operations in the UK marine licensing area to protect the environment and maritime archaeological heritage."

Rhyl Coastguards awarded for flood rescue efforts  Maritime and Coastguard Agency They’ve been presented with a Mayor of Rhyl Flood Heroes Award for services to the town during some of the worst floods to hit the area for around 20 years. On 5 December 2013, torrential rain and strong winds saw flooding affect approximately 200 homes, with most of the residents either elderly or infirm. The Coastguard Rescue Officers, geared up in their water rescue kit, carried out door to door searches, helping people to safety. Further flooding at Golden Sands Caravan Park resulted in 50 residents being evacuated to a safe area. Richard Furneaux, Coastguard Sector Manager for the Clywd area, said: With their years of experience and training in place, the Coastguard Rescue Officers took command and control of what was a difficult and ever changing situation. Their quick decisions ensured the safety of hundreds of residents cut off by the flood waters. Richard Martin, Chief Coastguard, said: Coastguards worked tirelessly over the winter months as storms and tidal surges battered many parts of the UK coastline. I’d like to take a moment to thank them all for their sterling efforts in what have been very challenging conditions. [Contact:1507]"
/government/news/divers-guilty-of-raiding-shipwrecks-without-declaring-their-find,"2 divers from Kent have today (Thursday 15 May 2014) pleaded guilty to not declaring valuable items from shipwrecks off the UK coast.  Divers guilty of raiding shipwrecks without declaring their find  Maritime and Coastguard Agency David Knight and Edward Huzzey, both from Sandgate, admitted to 19 offences between them, contrary to section 236 and section 237 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1995. Items were taken from shipwrecks off the Kent coast, with the first known objects removed in 2001. The shipwrecks targeted included German submarines from World War I and an unknown 200 year old wreck carrying English East India Company cargo. The items included 8 bronze cannons, 3 propellers from German submarines, lead and tin ingots, along with various other artefacts. It’s thought the combined value of the items is worth more than £250,000. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) is aware from diary entries that Knight and Huzzey used explosives and sophisticated cutting equipment to free wreck material. Sentencing has been scheduled for 2 July 2014. Alison Kentuck, the MCA’s Receiver of Wreck, said: Our message is clear: all wreck material found within or brought within UK territorial waters must be reported to the Receiver of Wreck. It is not a case of ‘finders keepers’. Finders of wreck have 28 days to declare their finds to the Receiver. This case highlights the importance of doing that and demonstrates what could happen to you if you don’t. > By reporting wreck material you are giving the rightful owner the opportunity to have their property returned and you may be adding important information to the historic record. Legitimate finders are likely to be entitled to a salvage award, but those who don’t declare items are breaking the law and could find themselves facing hefty fines. English Heritage has provided advice on handling cultural objects, assessed the importance of objects seized as evidence and provided expert advice in relation to uncontrolled salvage on submerged archaeological remains. Mark Harrison, English Heritage’s National Policing and Crime Adviser, said: We recognise that the majority of divers enjoy the historic marine environment and comply with the laws and regulations relating to wrecks and salvage. This case sends out a > clear message that the small criminal minority will be identified and brought to justice. Mark Dunkley, English Heritage’s Maritime Designation Adviser, said: The investigation has highlighted the need to tackle heritage crime, wherever it occurs, so that the remains of our past remain part of our future. The MCA would also like to appeal to the public regarding the whereabouts of six bronze cannons that remain outstanding. They were constructed in 1807 by W & G and have the English East India Company logo (VEIC) on them. If anyone knows the location of any of these cannons, please contact the Receiver of Wreck on 02380 329 474. [Contact:1507]"
/government/news/rhib-collision-in-cardiff-bay-leads-to-substantial-fine,"A Cardiff sailing club and its chief instructor have been sentenced after failing to take proper care of children on one of their courses. Rhib collision in Cardiff Bay leads to substantial fine  Maritime and Coastguard Agency Penarth Motor Boat and Sailing Club, trading as Cardiff Bay Yacht Club, has been fined £40,000 and its Chief Instructor has been given 180 hours of community service. Both Cardiff Bay Yacht Club and Nicholas Sawyer pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing to charges relating to failures in their duty of care for children attending a residential course in October 2010. The 4-day sailing training course was attended by 24 girls aged between 10 and 14. On the evening of 27 October 2010, after a day’s training, the girls were taken ice skating. On leaving the rink at 8pm the girls boarded the 4 club RHIBs to take them across Cardiff Bay back to their accommodation. It was dark and the RHIBs had no navigation lights, even though this is required by law. The children were not supplied with lifejackets and were expected to use their own floatation jackets. Two of the RHIB coxswains were paid contractors employed by Cardiff Bay Yacht Club but were not qualified for navigating at night. A collision took place between the two RHIBs being controlled by these coxswains, and some of the children were thrown in to the water. One of the girls, aged 10, was knocked momentarily unconscious when she was thrown into the water. All the girls were recovered from the water and taken ashore. The following day the girl who was knocked unconscious began to deteriorate and was collected and taken to hospital by her mother. This child was later diagnosed as suffering from a life-changing brain injury for which she is still receiving treatment. Another child suffered three compressed discs in her spine. The incident was not reported to the Maritime and Coastguard Agency and the agency was unaware of the incident until the parents of the severely injured girl contacted Cardiff Marine Office a year later. Sentencing took place on Friday 30 May 2014 at Cardiff Crown Court. In passing sentence, Judge Bidder said: This serious accident would not have happened if the Cardiff Bay Yacht Club and Nick Sawyer had assessed risk before transporting children across the bay …. It is important for those responsible for children’s safety on water to realise why assessing risks is necessary. Mr Robert Cotter, Surveyor in Charge at Cardiff Marine Office said: When you entrust your child into someone else’s care you expect them to do everything necessary to keep them safe. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency takes a very dim view of the actions of Cardiff Bay Yacht Club and Nicholas Sawyer and their attitude to safety. High powered RHIBs need to be used responsibly. Operating these vessels in the dark with no navigation lights is foolish in the extreme. The safety of all on board and other users of Cardiff Bay should be the number one priority and this wasn’t the case. [Contact:1507]"

The purpose built facility will provide Coastguard Rescue Officers with essential training and skills to help them deal with emergency situations on the UK coastline. Facilities will include an 8 metre-high ‘cliff face’ to train teams in how to carry out cliff rescues. This climbing wall will descend 4 metres into a pit, to enable Coastguards to gain experience of working in enclosed spaces. The site will also be the new base for the Hill Head Coastguard Rescue Team. The entire project is set to cost around £2.5million and is scheduled for completion in 2015. Sir Alan Massey, Chief Executive of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, said: This modern, innovative training centre will give our Coastguard Rescue Officers the skills they need to respond to any kind of emergency on our coast. These are dedicated, selfless volunteers who are prepared to put themselves out to ensure the safety of others, and they deserve the very best of training and equipment to support them in their tasks. This is an exciting time for the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, as we take bold steps to modernise our search and rescue capabilities throughout the UK. We aim to be the best maritime safety organisation in the world, and providing modern, highly effective facilities like the Daedalus training centre is another important step towards realising that vision.

/government/news/tug-boat-owner-jailed-after-crew-man-dies,"Tug boat owner of the 'Endurance' given 8 month custodial sentence Tug boat owner jailed after crew man dies  Maritime and Coastguard Agency A tug boat owner was today was given an 8 month custodial sentence after his crew member died trying to reattach a tow line in a violent storm. During today’s hearing at Southampton Crown Court, Martin Richley owner and skipper of 9.5m Medway Tug Boat ‘Endurance’ pleaded guilty to serious offences under the Merchant Shipping Act. The case related to events on 3 and 4 February 2013. On 3 February 2013 the ‘Endurance began to tow a 60ft motor cruiser ‘Sirus M’ from the River Medway to Brighton on the south coast of England. On board the ‘Endurance’ was Mr Richley acting as skipper along with Mr Steven Trice acting as the crew. As the ‘Endurance’ left the Medway Mr Richley was warned by Medway Vessel Traffic Monitoring Station (VTS) that strong winds up to gale force 8 had been forecast. Despite being given this gale warning Mr Richley decided to continue on his journey to Brighton. Mr Richley was also not qualified to carry out this passage and his tug ‘Endurance’ was licenced only for use in ‘favourable’ weather conditions. Shortly before midnight on the 4 February 2013, in gale force winds whilst on route to Brighton the tow line between the ‘Endurance’ and the “’Sirius M’ snapped as they passed Beachy Head and whilst trying to reattach the vessels, Mr Trice fell overboard and was lost. Dover and Solent Maritime Rescue Coordination Centres coordinated the search. Newhaven and Eastbourne lifeboats battled high seas and violent storm force winds in their attempt to find and rescue Mr Trice. The search continued for several hours, but Mr Trice was not found. His body was recovered several weeks later. In passing sentence His Honour Judge Ralls Q.C said “This was a catalogue of disasters, Mr Richly was prepared to take a chance…. it was a disaster waiting to happen after a series of bad decisions.” Captain Andrew Rudge, MCA Area Operations Manager said; “This was a tragic incident that should not have happened. Mr Richley should not have accepted to take on the tow as he was ill equipped, unqualified and his vessel was not suitable.” Note to Editors Martin Richley was charged with being the captain of a vessel put his crew at risk of serious injury/death and as the owner his operations were unsafe under sections 58 and 100 of The Merchant Shipping Act.

Port Marine Safety Code - Health Check Trends 2015  Maritime and Coastguard Agency The MCA seeks to undertake eight PMSC health check visits annually, aiming to visit a range of different types of organisation across all parts of the UK. During 2015, the MCA conducted eight PMSC health checks throughout the UK at the following type of ports: 1x Private 3x Municipal 4x Trust As a result of the eight health checks conducted during 2015, three organisations were deemed as non-compliant and will receive return visits during 2016 to verify that issues have been addressed. Future health checks will continue to have a particular emphasis on supporting smaller harbours or ports, particularly under municipal ownership, whilst also including a number of larger ports. The MCA would encourage industry to take account of the enhancements mentioned in this report and consider if any might be applicable to their organisations."
/government/news/cold-water-shock-short-film,"We’ve just launched our new film, which targets 18 to 29 year old men with a message about the dangers of cold water shock. The new 40-second film aims to highlight the dangers of jumping or falling into water, especially after drinking, and reveals some stark dangers.   Cold water shock short film Emergency response Maritime and Coastguard Agency The MCA commissioned the eye-opening film in a bid to reduce drowning fatalities across the UK; Coastguard statistics reveal that on average around 50 people die of alcohol-related drowning around the coast of the UK each year. Of these, a significant percentage are young men who end up in the water as they make their way home. Each tragic incident has a different cause, ranging from slipping from river banks or harbour sides to dares from friends that have gone wrong. Even if the weather is warm, the waters around the UK remain extremely cold throughout the year. If you fall into the water, you are likely to suffer from cold water shock – your breathing increases uncontrollably meaning that you are more likely to take water into your lungs and drown. People who’ve been drinking are more likely to take risks, combining this with a dangerous environment like cold water can be lethal. We’d like everyone to take care near water, make sure they keep an eye on their mates and take a safe route (away from water) on the way home. And remember, if you see anyone in trouble at the coast call 999 and ask for the Coastguard.’ See ‘Cold water shock’ here Cold water shock"

/government/news/critically-endangered-tansy-beetle-re-discovered-at-woodwalton-fen-nnr-after-a-40-year-absence,"The rare and visually stunning iridescent green tansy beetle (Chrysolina graminis) – was believed to have one last remaining stronghold in the UK on a 30km stretch of the banks of the river Ouse in York. Critically endangered tansy beetle re-discovered at Woodwalton Fen NNR after a 40 year absence  Natural England Now a momentous discovery has shown the existence of another population in the East Anglian fens. The discovery at Woodwalton Fen National Nature Reserve ( NNR ) is significant as it demonstrates the resilience of the species when given the right conditions. The site is all that remains of a great wetland around Whittlesey Mere which was drained in 1851, leading to the loss of many species of wildlife. While the tansy beetle initially survived, its isolation was thought to have led to its ultimate extinction in Woodwalton in 1973, the date of its last recorded sighting, so it was a great surprise to entomologist, Dr. Peter Kirby, to discover a small population when carrying out ditch surveys for Natural England at Woodwalton this summer. Dr Kirby said: “It is not uncommon for invertebrate populations to survive at extremely low levels for many years until conditions become suitable for an expansion and that appears to be what has happened here.” Alan Bowley, Senior Reserve Manager at Natural England said: “This is such an exciting find. Woodwalton Fen is an isolated fragment of a once much larger wetland and so rare animals are always at risk of extinction, but this demonstrates how important these sites are for providing a refuge for these species to survive against the odds. There is only one other site in Britain where this beautiful creature is found and we will be working hard to try and ensure that it can flourish here.” Natural England has been working closely with partners on the Great Fen vision to create new habitat around the NNR , and with the Tansy Beetle Action Group ( TBAG ) to study how best to improve conditions for the beetle. So the fact that it is still living in the Fen is a real boost to those efforts. Vicky Kindemba from Buglife and co-chair of TBAG said: “This is fantastic news for our amazing tansy beetle! This rare beetle now has a real chance at survival by expanding into the Fens. However, we still need to work hard to help it, and we would like everyone to get involved by ‘ Adopting a tansy beetle’ .” Notes for editors Image available on request.

The tansy beetle The tansy beetle (Chrysolina graminis): a large, iridescent green leaf beetle, with a coppery sheen, was once widespread in Britain, but it is currently critically endangered, not just in the UK but across its worldwide range. It is now a conservation priority species in England (section 41) species, which means that public bodies have a duty to protect it, together with its habitat. Although once widespread in the UK living in wetland areas, it has otherwise recently only been found along the banks of a 30km stretch of the River Ouse, around York, mainly eating tansy (Tanacetum vulgare), a perennial herb which has given the beetle its name. At their York site they complete their entire life cycle on and around the plant, beside riverbanks or in wetlands. If a clump disappears, the beetles have to walk to a new clump – they don’t seem to fly. Although tansy is widespread along the River Ouse, land-use changes and the increase of invasive species such as Himalayan balsam have resulted in a decline in tansy plants over the past few decades. This has of course affected tansy beetle numbers and their populations have become increasingly isolated. The ecology of the beetle in the fens differs as it has always been a wetland beetle feeding on water mint. For more information see Buglife’s fact sheet on the tansy beetle . Woodwalton Fen National Nature Reserve Woodwalton Fen NNR is one of the oldest nature reserves in Britain, having been purchased by Charles Rothschild in 1910 and declared the first reserve of the Society for the Promotion of Nature reserves in 1919. It has been a national nature reserve since 1954. Together with nearby Holme Fen NNR , Woodwalton is one of very few remnants of fen habitat to survive the large scale drainage for agriculture between the 17th and 19th century which saw the loss of almost all the wetland habitat in the wider area. The site was once part of a great wetland around Whittlesey Mere which was drained in 1851, leading to the loss of many species of wildlife. Tansy beetle was one which initially survived, but in such an isolated situation was always vulnerable to extinction.

About the Great Fen Vision The Great Fen is a 50-year project to create a huge wetland area. One of the largest restoration projects of its type in Europe, the landscape of the fens between Peterborough and Huntingdon is being transformed for the benefit both of wildlife and of people. The vision is to create an enveloping landscape of 3,700 hectares around the existing NNRs. By buying and restoring farmland, they will be joined together and greatly enlarged, establishing a range of wetland features with unprecedented conservation benefits for wildlife. As well as providing a haven for fen wildlife, the Great Fen will create a massive green space for people, opening new opportunities for recreation, education and business. It will incorporate areas where winter flood waters can be stored and will prevent the release of huge amounts of carbon dioxide each year. Partners include the Environment Agency, Huntingdonshire District Council, Middle Level Commissioners, Natural England and the Wildlife Trust for Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Northamptonshire."
/government/news/historic-london-parkland-gets-national-recognition-for-its-nature-conservation-importance,"Two of London’s much-loved parks have been officially recognised as being among the most important places for wildlife in England.  Historic London parkland gets national recognition for its nature conservation importance  Natural England Natural England’s Executive Board recently approved the designation of Bushy Park and Home Park in the London Borough of Richmond as a new Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) . SSSIs represent the best sites for wildlife and geology and there are more than 4,100 SSSIs in England, covering around 8 per cent of the country. SSSI status gives legal protection that ensures that the nationally important wildlife and geology of a site is recognised in its management and future use. Bushy Park and Home Park SSSI is of special interest for its exceptionally large population of ancient and veteran trees, extensive areas of semi-natural lowland dry acid grassland, and its internationally significant populations of rare invertebrates. More than 200 veteran trees have been identified at the site of which 94 are classed as ancient. The site is the highest ranking of ten comparable sites in the Greater London area and one of only 44 sites nationally known to support more than 100 veteran trees. The trees at Bushy Park and Home Park are rare relicts of a wood-pasture management on the site that dates back to the 15th Century. The trees include oak and lime with some horse chestnut and sweet chestnut and approximately sixteen other species of tree. A notable feature is the occurrence of a large number of very old hawthorn trees, many of which are festooned with mistletoe. The great age of many of the trees at the site provides an abundance of dead and fallen timber. Inside these trees there is a succession of fungi which actively break down the heartwood to produce a rich internal wood mould. This habitat, often deep within a large living tree, provides the perfect environment for specialised saproxylic (wood feeding) invertebrate species. The site is home to so many rare and threatened species of wood feeding invertebrates that it ranks amongst the top five in Britain for this highly specialised group of creatures, for which Britain has international importance The majority of the 540ha site that has been notified as SSSI is held in trust by the Crown Estate. Bushy Park is managed by The Royal Parks and Home Park by Historic Royal Palaces who have both welcomed the SSSI designation and are looking forward to working with Natural England’s Thames Valley team over the future sympathetic management requirements of the special interest of the site. Janette Ward, Natural England’s Director for Conservation Strategy and Innovation, said: “We are delighted to be able to notify Bushy Park and Home Park as England’s latest SSSI and pleased that the new designation has been supported by both the Royal Parks and Historic Royal Palaces. “The SSSI status will help to protect a very important site for rare habitats and species and provides a great opportunity to enhance both the wildlife and people’s access to nature in one of London’s historic green spaces.” Nicholas Mallory Garbutt, Tree and Wildlife Conservation Manager, Historic Royal Palaces, said, “We are delighted that Home Park has received this recognition of its national significance for wildlife conservation. This historic deer park is a vital part of Hampton Court Palace’s history, which has been enjoyed by everyone from King Henry VIII, to the many visitors who flock to the Hampton Court Flower Show every year. “The results of recent wildlife surveys show that the historic trees and acid grassland of the park provide an important habitat for wildlife conservation, and we look forward to working with Natural England to continue to preserve this environment for future generations.” Ray Brodie, Manager of Bushy Park, Royal Parks, said: “This is a great accolade for Bushy Park and confirms what we have long-known to be true: that Bushy Park is one of the finest sites in England for wildlife and ecology. Bushy Park contains many rare and important species and habitats including rare stag beetles and around ten different species of bat. “The Royal Parks works hard to conserve and protect this unique environment, while also ensuring that Bushy Park is a peaceful haven for the many thousands of visitors who come each year to relax, unwind and enjoy the natural surroundings.” There is now a four month period when people with an interest in the site can make representations or objections to Natural England. Natural England’s Board will then consider any unresolved objections before deciding whether to formally confirm the site’s new status. For further information (media enquiries only) please contact: david.hirst@naturalengland.org.uk Twitter: @NaturalEngland About SSSIs A Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) is one of the country’s very best wildlife and/or geological sites. SSSIs include some of the most spectacular and beautiful habitats: wetlands teeming with wading birds, winding chalk rivers, flower-rich meadows, windswept shingle beaches and remote upland peat bogs. There are more than 4,100 Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) in England, covering around 8% of the country’s land area. More than 70% of these sites (by area) are internationally important for their wildlife and designated as Special Areas of Conservation (SACs), Special Protection Areas (SPAs) or Ramsar sites. Additional notes A ‘veteran tree’ is usually in the second or mature stage of its life and has important wildlife and habitat features including; hollowing or associated decay fungi, holes, wounds and large dead branches. It will generally include old trees but also younger, middle aged trees where premature aging characteristics are present. The term ‘ancient tree’ refers to trees of interest biologically, aesthetically or culturally because of their great age; trees in the ancient or third and final stage of their life; and, trees that are the old relative to others of the same species. Bushy Park and Home Park SSSI, London Borough of Richmond was notified as an SSSI by Natural England on 5 September 2014. The site is located to the south west of London in the Borough of Richmond within the Thames Valley National Character Area: national grid reference TQ159692. Further information can be obtained from Graham Steven at Natural England, Cromwell House, 15 Andover Road, Winchester, SO23 7BT, telephone number: 0300 060 0398. Any representations or objections about this notification should be made in writing to Graham Steven at the address above, before 5 January 2015."
/government/news/hen-harrier-satellite-tracking-programme-results-published,"Initial findings of Natural England's hen harrier tracking programme 2007 to 2014. Hen harrier satellite tracking programme results published  Natural England The hen harrier is one of England’s rarest and most spectacular birds of prey. On the continent these birds are found across a range of agricultural habitats, but in the UK their breeding range is currently confined primarily to heather moorland in the uplands, including Wales, northern England and Scotland. Natural England is working on a range of fronts to further the conservation of this species. This includes: satellite tracking to improve our understanding of the bird’s movements and behaviour supporting wildlife friendly habitat management in the uplands working with a range of partners to develop a wider conservation strategy for hen harriers that looks to protect the current population and extend its range across England Since 2007 Natural England has tagged 47 juvenile hen harriers in England, Scotland and the Isle of Man, and built up a detailed picture of their movements. An additional 6 birds have been tagged by Natural England and tracked by the RSPB as part of their Skydancer project. The RSPB were also given 2 tags to fit onto hen harriers in Argyllshire which they were also responsible for tracking. We can now see in detail how some birds regularly travel hundreds of miles while others stick to much more confined geographical areas. Of the 47 birds Natural England has tracked, 4 are known to still be alive. 6 have been found dead and their bodies recovered and examined. There is evidence that infectious disease and/or predation have played a role in the deaths of 5 of them; 1 bird – Bowland Betty - was recovered last year and the Zoological Society of London ( ZSL ) indicated she had been shot. Signals from the tags fitted to the remaining 37 tagged hen harriers have ceased transmitting and the whereabouts of the birds are unknown. See table below giving summary of hen harriers satellite tagged since 2007 . Data from 2014 The results of this year’s tracking programme suggest the class of 2014 have experienced very mixed fortunes. This year Natural England tagged 9 hen harrier chicks at sites in the North West, the Peak District and Bowland Fells in England, and at Langholm in Scotland. 5 of these birds have been tracked as part of Natural England’s satellite tracking programme and 4 others (all from Bowland) as part of the RSPB’s Skydancer project. The results Highlander and Burt from Bowland, and Annie from Langholm are alive and well and signals are still being actively transmitted. Natural mortality rates in any year will be highest for recently fledged and inexperienced birds. This year, 2 of the young birds that Natural England were tracking (JoAnne from the north of England and NaTalie from the Peak District) are known to have died, probably from natural causes, although this is being investigated. Their bodies have been recovered and their remains have been examined by ZSL . Satellite tags from an additional 4 birds are no longer sending out a signal and are subject to ongoing investigations. 2 of the missing birds are those the RSPB were tracking near Bowland (Sky and Hope). The RSPB hold the detailed tracking data and have confirmed that signals from the birds’ tags disappeared on 10 and 13 September 2014 respectively in close proximity to each other in the Bowland area. Natural England was tracking Imogen (from a nest in northern England) and Sid (from a nest in Langholm, in Scotland). Signals from Imogen’s tag ceased on 1 September 2014 at a site in the Yorkshire Dales. Sid’s signal ceased transmitting on 21 September 2014 at a separate site in the Yorkshire Dales. What do satellite transmitters tell us? The satellite transmitters used on hen harriers are solar powered and transmit for about 10 hours before then undergoing a recharging period lasting around 48 hours (timelines are subject to a range of factors including prevailing light conditions). In the case of Sid and Imogen, both signals had run their 10 hour course when last received and there is no indication of sudden signal interruption. It is quite possible, therefore, that the birds travelled some distance from their last recorded location (they have 48 hours to do so) and were either then lost en route, or for unexplained reasons, the tags never recharged. Sky’s case is unusual as the signal suddenly ceased quite early in the 10 hour transmission slot, suggesting an immediate and on-site interruption. It is important to recognise that tracking data does not usually enable us to determine the circumstances that have led to loss of signal, nor what has happened to the bird. Tags normally operate for around 3 years and tag failure is uncommon but not unknown (we are aware of 3 instances since 2007 where birds were known to be alive but their tags were no longer transmitting). The fact that birds can travel up to 48 hours after their last signal also makes it very difficult to draw hard and fast conclusions about what may have happened to the birds when their signals cease transmission. Ultimately, only recovery of carcases and forensic analysis can establish that. What you can do In conjunction with local landowners and wildlife crime officers, Natural England have actively searched the last recorded location for the four birds that have recently gone missing, and to date have found nothing. The National Wildlife Crime Unit and local police have been informed. We are appealing for further information from local landowners and members of the public and anyone with any information is welcome to contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or their local police wildlife crime officer. While Natural England is concerned for this year’s missing birds, there is more encouraging news from at least 2 of the birds tagged in 2013. The young females Hattie and Grainne successfully reared 8 chicks between them and both are still actively transmitting satellite signals. Joint action plan for the recovery of the hen harrier in England In a project led by Defra and involving a wider range of partners* we are working with moor owners, gamekeepers and conservation groups, to agree a shared plan to restore England’s hen harrier population. If agreement can be secured, this plan will promote breeding success across the uplands, re-establishment of the birds to the English lowlands and also help tackle wildlife crime, all aimed at encouraging sustainable growth of the hen harrier population. Natural England is firmly committed to this approach, and is working with all our partners to develop the plan in order to provide a more secure future for one of England’s most iconic breeding birds. *The Hen Harrier Sub-Group includes Natural England, RSPB, GWCT, National Gamekeepers Organisation, National Parks UK and the Moorland Association Tracking programme results !@1 The full results of Natural England’s satellite tracking programme will be published as part of a PhD in 2015, but we are able to publish summary data for the birds tagged since 2007. This shows what we know about each bird’s status and grid reference (accurate to 100km2) of the last accurate transmission for the bird’s tag. In some instances, we are showing location only at a county level, following discussion with the relevant local raptor study groups, and concerns that providing a more accurate location could reveal sensitive roosting and breeding sites. !@2 Further information See Natural England’s web feature on the satellite tracking project."
/government/news/natural-england-project-shortlisted-for-heritage-angels-award,"Work supported by Natural England has been recognised for its efforts to safeguard one of England’s most ‘at risk’ built heritage sites. Natural England project shortlisted for Heritage Angels award  Natural England Work supported by Natural England at Hagley Park in Worcestershire is shortlisted for one of English Heritage’s prestigious Angel Awards . It’s just one of a number of projects where Natural England has been working with heritage bodies to safeguard some of our most vulnerable built heritage. These include a number of projects highlighted in English Heritage’s latest Heritage at Risk Register . The 2014 register is the most comprehensive so far, with listed buildings, places of worship, industrial sites, scheduled monuments, parks and gardens, ship wrecks and battlefields identified as ‘at risk’. Although English Heritage has added many new sites in need of rescue to the register, there are still plenty of success stories to celebrate. This year, close co-operation between Natural England and English Heritage has been vital to the rescue and removal of 160 sites from the 2013 register. Supporting England’s land managers Funding from the Environmental Stewardship scheme, which is administered by Natural England on behalf of the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, has helped hundreds of farmers and other land managers look after heritage on their land. This year Natural England has helped remove 160 items from the 2013 Heritage at Risk Register: 150 scheduled monuments, 7 listed buildings and structures and 3 registered parks and gardens. Our investment has been responsible for almost a third of all removals from the register. Thousands of farm businesses have received support to protect the archaeological earthworks and buried archaeological sites on their land. For example, where erosion or unrestricted growth of vegetation threatens scheduled monuments they can be covered by an Environmental Stewardship scheme. Natural England also supports projects that help with the restoration of some of our most-valued parkland, historic farm buildings and historic houses. ‘Successful partnerships’ Jez Bretherton, historic environment senior specialist, said: Successful partnerships are crucial in safeguarding historic features through Environmental Stewardship, many of which are in private ownership. Co-ordinating with English Heritage and local authority archaeologists and conservation officers ensures owners and managers of our heritage receive help and support to change the management of our most vulnerable heritage assets. It’s very encouraging to see that our work with farmers and land managers has resulted in the removal of a record number of sites from the Heritage at Risk Register this year. Expert advice from English Heritage, coupled with support from Natural England agri-environment agreements, has enabled landowners to save prehistoric burial mounds, Norman castles, industrial and agricultural sites, World War 2 defences and every chapter of our history in between. Since 2005 we’ve invested more than £200 million of Environmental Stewardship funding in a wide range of rural conservation measures for the historic environment. Heritage at Risk is English Heritage’s campaign to save listed buildings and important historic sites, places and landmarks from neglect or decay. At its heart is the Heritage at Risk Register, an online database containing details of each site known to be at risk which is analysed and updated annually. Kilpeck Castle: Norman castle removed from the ‘at risk’ register Kilpeck Castle has overlooked a quiet Herefordshire village for almost 1,000 years and has just received some much-needed care and attention which has enabled it to be removed from the Heritage at Risk Register. Kilpeck is a Norman motte and bailey castle characteristic of the Welsh Marches - an area of the country that saw considerable action during the major power-broking of the medieval period. Until recently, Kilpeck Castle gave up its secrets only to those brave enough to seek out the precarious slope path up the thorny scrub-covered mound. A hidden site with a hidden story, and deteriorating year by year. Managing the castle site is major challenge as it is situated among large trees and has high earthwork ditches, a steep-sided mound and crumbling masonry. Kilpeck is open to the public but also needs to be grazed hard enough by livestock to stop the site disappearing under vigorous hawthorn growth. Without a stable sward of grass, the soil which forms the monument will also get washed or worn away, exposing archaeological layers and more vulnerable masonry. Working in partnership, Natural England, the Whitfield Estate and English Heritage resolved to conserve the scheduled monument under better management through an Environmental Stewardship Scheme Higher Level agreement. Natural England lead adviser, Esther Stephens, explains: We arranged the funding for a project to carry out work on the site with the objective of getting it removed from the Heritage at Risk Register. This involved bringing in structural engineers, archaeologists, ecologists and specialist building contractors. The unstable masonry blocks were anchored to each other via the centre-point of the mound, thorn has been cleared from the site, erosion scars on the slopes of the monument were repaired and sheep have now returned to graze the whole area. Everyone involved in the project recognises that it’s a change to the site for visitors, but these works were essential to aid the estate in keeping on top of the conservation of the whole area for future generations to enjoy. It’s great that visitors can now better appreciate the layout of this seat of Norman power and its relationship to the surrounding landscape. The site’s conservation has made the story of the Norman Conquest so much more accessible."
/government/news/hagley-park-restoration-project-shortlisted-for-heritage-award,"A project supported by Natural England has been recognised for its contribution to restoring one of England’s finest historic landscapes Hagley Park restoration project shortlisted for heritage award  Natural England A project that has been supported by Natural England at Hagley Park in Worcestershire was a worthy runner-up in the 2014 English Heritage Angels Awards ‘best rescue of any other historic building or site’ category. The centrepiece of the original Georgian parkland is the Hagley Cascades, a series of lakes linked by cascades of tumbling water. At the top of the chain of lakes stood a rotunda and at the bottom a miniature Palladian bridge, the 2 acting as focal points in the landscape. Decline in the quality of the historic designed landscapes at Hagley Park has been evident for decades. As recently as 2013 the lakes were silted up, the cascades had collapsed, famous views had become obscured, the rotunda grade 2* listed building was on English Heritage’s Heritage at Risk register and all that survived of the bridge was its foundations. The paths that had once formed a circuit along the cascades had vanished under feet of soil. A landscape restored The restoration of the landscape began with the production of a detailed conservation management plan in a partnership between the Hagley Park trustees, the local authority, consultees and potential funding bodies. Following several years of partnership project work involving Natural England and English Heritage, the rotunda and the Palladian bridge have now been repaired and restored. The bridge was sympathetically restored following the discovery of the original architect’s drawings and painstaking archaeological investigation. The cascades have been repaired and historic views and vistas have been reopened. About a mile of the path circuit has been restored to enable visitors to once again appreciate the landscape of the Georgian parkland. Partnership working Jez Bretherton, historic environment senior specialist said: The achievements at Hagley Park are one of this year’s historic environment highlights and we’re delighted that the project has been recognised by the Heritage Angels awards. The project shows what can be achieved by an enthusiastic land owner supported by some excellent joint working. This project is a great example of how Natural England works in partnership with land managers, supports heritage skills businesses and involves local communities to achieve some exciting results. Some 25 people have been employed in working on the project at Hagley Park, including stonemasons, wallers, carpenters, plasterers, arboriculturists, hydrologists, conservation-accredited architects, landscape architects and garden historians. Supported by Environmental Stewardship, as well as funding from English Heritage and the land owner, the works include tree planting and grazing management in the deer park to enhance wood pasture and parkland habitat. Helping safeguard our ‘at risk’ heritage Funding from the Environmental Stewardship scheme, which is administered by Natural England on behalf of the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, has helped hundreds of farmers and other land managers look after heritage on their land.

/government/news/community-path-scheme-is-a-success,"Natural England has produced a report that summarises the success of the Paths for Communities (P4C) scheme. Community path scheme is a success  Natural England The 2 year community-focused initiative, launched in May 2012, was set up to develop and enhance local public paths, both extending access and making the network easier to use. The £2 million scheme was managed by Natural England and encouraged rural communities to work with landowners to develop public rights of way. As well as extending the network, it brought a range of both social and economic benefits. Main findings The P4C fund invested in over 183 km of public rights of way ( PROW ) including the creation of an additional 55 km of new bridleway and 21 km of new footpaths - in total over 76 km of new PROW . In addition, P4C secured improvements to a further 107 km of existing routes where these were connected to the new PROW created. Most of the routes provided access for walking, horse-riding and cycling and many of the projects also provided specific improvements for a range of users with limited mobility including wheelchair users and those with pushchairs. Improvements included surface works to make the routes more accessible, bridges, access friendly gates, signposting, promotion and information boards. The scheme supported a range of social and economic benefits to rural communities and levered in additional funding from business as well as voluntary contributions. Letters of support were received from 112 rural businesses along with supportive letters from schools and medical professionals, all of which anticipated a range of benefits from the PROW improvements. The projects recorded an input of 11,786 hours of volunteer time. A good level of interest in the scheme was demonstrated along with the ability of communities to develop applications that met scheme requirements. There was still evidence of unsatisfied demand when the project closed to applications. View the final report and supporting documents. Andrew Sells, Natural England’s Chairman said: Paths for Communities was the first scheme of its kind and proved incredibly popular. Communities are best placed to identify where rights of way improvements are needed and they’ve worked hard with landowners and a variety of organisations on a significant number of projects around the country. Local businesses have also been supported by the work needed to create and improve new routes – and from more people enjoying them. There is a wealth of evidence in this final report and we hope it will help and inspire funding organisations to support communities to develop similar projects in the future. Environment Minister Dan Rogerson said: The Path for Communities scheme has been a huge success, opening up miles and miles of beautiful countryside for everyone to enjoy. It has boosted local tourism and rural businesses helping to create a stronger economy and a fairer society. What sets this scheme apart is that local people had the opportunity to identify the projects that would benefit their community the most. The P4C scheme was launched in May 2012 with £2 million of funds provided under the Rural Development Programme for England to spend by March 2014. The scheme closed to new applications at the end of September 2013. Expressions of interest were received from 287 potential applicants and 43 communities were awarded grants to the value of £1,970,375 (98.5% of the £2 million budget). Natural England has produced an interactive map showing case studies of the projects which have benefited from the fund. Case study Friends of the Beck was set up in 2012 to improve the environment and access along Bottesford Beck, which runs on the southern edge of Scunthorpe. The Beck Linear Park Path application was awarded a grant of £73,609 towards total project costs of £82,099. The project successfully created approximately 3.3km of new bridleway and 1.5km of new footpath, which included surface improvements, signposting and barriers to stop motorbikes. Margaret Armiger led the group and said: We now have a bridleway accessible and used by, horses, prams, pushchairs, wheelchairs, cycles, runners, walkers and dog walkers. The general consensus is one of gratitude for access by all to our wonderful river, lake and parkland. The project’s success has encouraged the Friends of the Beck to develop their work even further and the group are working in close partnership with the Local Authority and Environment Agency on various environmental improvement projects along the Beck. Their hard work and dedication has been recognised a number of awards including a Big Society award, CPRE award, runner up for the North Lincolnshire Council Community award and a commendation for a Living Waterways award. ENDS Notes to editors Examples of P4C projects include: in Somerset a 60 metre bridleway at Kilmersdon Link is providing an important connection to the Colliers Way running from Frome to Bath 800 metres of bridleway created by the Nesscliffe Hills project in Shropshire is providing an essential safe link across the busy A5 trunk road. It now links to 51 miles of walking, cycling and horse riding stretching across the whole county and connecting to The Jack Mytton Way at Church Stretton a National Trust project has created 12.3 km of new bridleway and 900 metres of new footpath in the Lizard Peninsula in Cornwall the P4C project in Elwick, County Durham, has contributed to a newly created Heritage Trail around The Limestone Landscape Partnership’s ‘Village Atlas’, attracting more visitors and boosting the tourist economy. Partners involved in P4C projects include: local authorities (parish councils, highway authorities, district councils, national parks) access interests (Ramblers, health walk groups, Parish Paths Partnerships, Sustrans, British Horse Society, Local Access Forums) landowners environmental organisations (local environmental groups, wildlife trusts, Country Park Friends group, National Trust) community groups (local residents, youth groups, church, local trusts, disability groups, Rural Community Council) local services (schools, museums) public bodies (Environment Agency, Forestry Commission, Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty) private firms Costs The average cost per metre for all works associated with the project is £46.05 based on costs set out in application forms. This is a one-off cost, with most capital items expected to have a lifespan of 20 years. The cost of the surface improvements alone was £20.17 per metre. The costs include: surface works fencing gates, horse stiles and chicanes infrastructure such as bridges, boardwalks, raised platforms, steps, seats and bins drainage and earthworks interpretation panels, signposting, way marker posts promotion of the route"

/government/news/east-coast-tidal-surge-1-year-on,"Natural England’s work in areas affected by the tidal surge of December 2013 has helped the recovery of the rural economy. East coast tidal surge: 1 year on  Natural England The tidal surge that hit the east coast of England on 5 December 2013 was the most serious for 60 years. The surge was a result of a combination of high winds, low pressure and high tides pushing a ‘bulge’ of water into both the Irish and North seas. The North Sea reached more than 2 metres above predicted tide levels, putting a serious strain on sea defences all along the east coast. People living along the length of the coast felt the full impact of the extreme weather conditions, with more than 1,000 homes flooded. The tidal surge had a serious impact on some of England’s most popular coastal visitor destinations and resulted in damage to public footpaths, bridges, beach steps, birdwatching hides, fencing and field gates. During the traditionally busy late winter and early spring visitor season the damage caused by the storm posed a threat to environmental tourism at many sites and to the associated rural economy of the east coast of England. Tidal surge project Natural England was quick to take action in responding to the tidal surge and the serious impact it had on important coastal wildlife sites. We worked with our partners to help them clean up after the storm and to restore public access to some of the east coast’s finest nature reserves as rapidly as possible. In the months following the tidal surge, Natural England invested more than £500,000 in aiding the recovery of important wildlife areas. This has helped repair and replace visitor facilities including rebuilding birdwatching hides, repairing fences and reinstating visitor access. Recipients of our funding have included the Yorkshire, Lincolnshire, Norfolk, Suffolk and Kent Wildlife Trusts, North Lincolnshire Council, the RSPB and National Trust. The aim was to get important visitor destinations open in time for Easter 2014. Thanks to some excellent partnership working, supported by the funding from Natural England, all of the sites were back in business in time for the Easter holidays. Replacing visitor facilities and public access The Norfolk Wildlife Trust and National Trust suffered extensive damage to their nature reserves at Cley and Salthouse Marshes, particularly to grazing infrastructure and visitor facilities. The famous and much-loved thatched bird hides at Cley Marshes , which are essential to visitor enjoyment and important in avoiding disturbance to wildlife, were badly damaged. Natural England funded the purchase of local reed and the hire of a skilled thatcher for the repairs. We provided grants to replace livestock and for the purchase of fencing materials and field gates. We also funded the purchase of specialist equipment to monitor the salinity of the grazing land after it had been inundated with sea water during the surge. Birling Gap near Eastbourne is one of the most popular visitor destinations on the world famous Seven Sisters chalk cliffs in East Sussex. This site experienced 7 years’ of erosion in the winter of 2013 to 2014. As a result of the tidal surge the steps that provided the only access to the popular beach were unusable. With support from Natural England the beach steps have now been repaired so that an estimated 250,000 people each year can once again enjoy a visit to the beach and the marine nature reserve. The visitor facilities at the site are now more resilient to future extreme weather events as the beach steps are designed so that they can be moved if the cliffs recede further. A large section of the road down to the Spurn Head National Nature Reserve was washed away during the tidal surge. To reinstate this road is unrealistic as the peninsula is entering a period of dynamic change having been fixed in place for the last 160 years by now redundant sea defences. To enable the Yorkshire Wildlife Trust ( YWT ) to continue to manage the site, Natural England provided a grant that helped them to buy a large vehicle which can be used to transport materials for habitat restoration work on the reserve. YWT has also run some public safaris to help visitors to access the tip of Spurn Point. A more resilient future Part of Natural England’s role is to help habitats and the species they support to become more resilient to extreme weather. As a result of the tidal surge there has been an opportunity to make nature reserves more resilient to future storm events. Natural England worked with the Environment Agency, National Trust and the local community at Blakeney Freshes in north Norfolk to come up with a flood management scheme that sustainably conserves wildlife, while at the same time building in future climate change adaptation and resilience. Blakeney Freshes covers around 160 ha of freshwater grazing marsh of which about half is owned and managed by the National Trust as part of the Blakeney National Nature Reserve . The site is located within the North Norfolk Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and has Site of Special Scientific Interest, Special Protection Area and Ramsar designations. The Freshes is protected from coastal flooding by a long length of clay embankment which extends between the villages of Cley and Blakeney. The North Norfolk Coastal Path runs along the top of this embankment. Coastal footpath reopened to walkers The storm surge tide last year overtopped the full length of the embankment resulting in multiple breaches and damage to the structure. This resulted in the complete inundation of the marshes with saltwater, which was bad news for freshwater wildlife. The coastal path was also closed for safety reasons. In an area that is heavily reliant on income from tourism there was understandable concern from local businesses about the impact of the closure on the local economy. Natural England worked closely with the Environment Agency, Norfolk County Council and the National Trust to allow safe access to the path for walkers as quickly as possible and the works were successfully completed in time for Easter 2014. In November 2014 work was completed that gives the embankment a new design with a lower and wider crest and shallower slopes. This will be more resilient to damage during any future surge events. Alongside improvements to the existing sluices and drainage system this will also reduce the time that saltwater stands on the marshes. Natural England has also helped fund similar sustainable embankment repair works at Havergate Island in Suffolk, which was also seriously damaged by the tidal surge."
/government/news/record-breeding-season-for-rare-wetland-birds-in-somerset,"The bearded tit, one of the UK’s rarest and fussiest birds is on the increase at a Somerset nature reserve. Record breeding season for rare wetland birds in Somerset  Natural England Thanks to the hard work of volunteers at Shapwick Heath National Nature Reserve ( NNR ), a total of more than 170 bearded tits or ‘bearded reedlings’ were recorded over a 4 week period at the reserve this autumn. Over 70 birds were recorded on one day alone. The first ever survey of the birds at Natural England’s Shapwick Heath NNR has revealed the encouraging results. It proved that there are more of the rare birds using the reedbeds at the reserve than previously known. As recently as 10 years ago the total number of bearded reedlings in the whole of Somerset was probably only around 20 birds. The birds are very particular about where they live. They are only found in reedbeds, where they nest among the reed stems and feed on reed seeds and reedbed insects. With only around 600 breeding pairs in the UK, they are one of the country’s rarest birds and a target for special conservation effort. Shapwick Heath is one of only a handful of places in the south west where the sparrow-sized birds are found and may have been attracted by the mosaic of rich wetland habitat that has been created. Robert Balch is one of the volunteers who organised the survey. He said: I’ve been volunteering for Natural England at Shapwick for several years and when you’re here regularly you get to know a place and its wildlife. Some of us felt that the numbers of bearded reedlings at Shapwick had increased in recent years and so we came up with the idea of having a proper survey to gather the evidence. It’s involved some early starts and a soaking in the rain, but we’ve proved there is a healthy population here. It’s great news that these delightful birds are bouncing back at Shapwick and it must be a sign that the reedbeds on the NNR are being managed well. The group planned the survey with the help of Natural England reserve manager, Simon Clarke, and it was carried out over a 4 week period between mid-September and early-October at 5 specific areas within the 500 ha reserve. Natural England’s NNR manager, Simon Clarke, said: We are incredibly privileged to have such a supportive and dedicated team of volunteers who were willing to go out in all weathers to help gather important, new evidence about the numbers of these rare birds. The results are great news for the Shapwick Heath NNR and we hope that the birds will spread from their stronghold here in the Avalon Marshes and colonise other sites in the south west. The reedbeds at the Avalon Marshes are now establishing very successfully and are providing the ideal habitat for a variety of wetland-loving wildlife, including bearded reedlings and bitterns. The results of this first-ever survey of the birds at Shapwick Heath are very encouraging indeed and we’ll be repeating it in future years to monitor any changes. Early mornings are the best time to count bearded reedlings. In the autumn, the birds erupt from the reedbeds in the early morning to gather and fly high above the reeds, perhaps dropping into a new part of the same reedbed, or occasionally leaving the site altogether and flying off to new locations. Natural England would like to thank all the volunteers who took part in the survey: Kevin Anderson, Alan Ashman, Robert Balch, Dick Best, Mike Hannon, Peter Kelly, Andrew Kirby, Paul Morrissey, Suzie Robson, Martin Sage, Shelly Saltman, Bill Urwin and Dionn Warner. Background About bearded reedlings (Panurus biarmicus) usually known as bearded tits - because of a superficial resemblance to long-tailed tits - these birds are not member of the tit family. Panurus biarmicus may in fact by a unique species and the only member of their family they are sparrow-sized with a long tail and weigh just 15g generally orange in colour, the males has a blue head and black ‘moustaches’ on its cheeks they are only found in reedbeds bearded tits pair for life; they lay up to 8 eggs in nests low down in the reeds and can raise 4 broods in a season bearded tits are very vulnerable to cold weather and their breeding can be much reduced after severe winters and cool, wet summers remarkably, bearded tits completely changing their diet between summer and winter; they eat insects in the summer, but feed only on seeds in the autumn, when they need to ingest grit to help them digest the tough seeds About Shapwick Heath NNR This wetland reserve covers over 500 ha at the heart of the Somerset Levels and Moors. Around 64 different species of birds nest at Shapwick, including Cetti’s warbler and bitterns, while dragonflies and over 27 species of butterfly abound in the summer. These include the silver washed fritillary, purple hairstreak and orange-tip, and the large and impressive white admiral. Over 24 different mammals have been seen at Shapwick, including water voles, lesser horseshoe bats and otters. In the 1960s, peat was removed from the area for horticultural use using huge machines, but this stopped in the 1990s. Today, these former peat pits have been transformed into a landscape of open lakes, reedbeds, fens and wet woodland, and have become a hugely important area for nature conservation. Reedlings are one of the winter wildlife highlights on the Somerset Levels, as they recover from last year’s floods. Over 100,000 waterbirds, bitterns, otters and the famous starling murmurations - with great local food and accommodation - mean there is plenty to draw visitors to enjoy a wildlife spectacle this winter.

/government/news/natural-england-approves-trial-release-of-beavers,"A licence has been issued to Devon Wildlife Trust permitting the managed release into the wild of beavers on a 5 year trial basis. Natural England approves trial release of beavers  Natural England On Monday 2 February 2015, Natural England issued [InlineAttachment:1] to the Devon Wildlife Trust, permitting the managed release into the wild of beavers currently resident in the River Otter catchment in Devon, on a 5 year trial basis. The licence is subject to a range of conditions, including confirmation that the beavers are of Eurasian origin and are free of the Echinococcus multilocularis parasite. Under the terms of the licence, by September at the latest, Devon Wildlife Trust must develop a [InlineAttachment:2] to deal quickly with any undesirable impacts which the beavers may have on the River Otter during the trial period, as well as a monitoring programme to study their impacts. Andrew Sells, Natural England’s Chairman commented: Reintroduction of a species is a complicated and emotive subject and we have considered this application very carefully. Responses to our written consultation and public meetings have been generally positive and we are now satisfied with Devon Wildlife Trust’s plans for managing and monitoring the project, which will allow important evidence to be gathered during the trial on any impacts which the beavers may have. Future decisions by Natural England on the release of beavers will in large part be informed by the results of this trial. The unauthorised release of beavers remains illegal and Natural England does not expect to grant any other licences for beaver release during this trial period. Trapping and testing of the animals for Echinococcus multilocularis will be carried out by the Animal and Plant Health Agency under a separate licence that was granted towards the end of 2014. Devon Wildlife Trust’s licence application was thoroughly assessed against the internationally recognised guidelines published by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature ."

They assess the conservation status of 2 groups of insects - leaf beetles (named after their habit of eating leaves) and stoneflies (aquatic species found in rivers and streams) – and classifies them as either ‘vulnerable’, ‘endangered’ or ‘critically endangered’ . The review of leaf beetles found that out of the 283 species in the UK: 3 have become extinct in Britain in the last 100 years 7 are classified as critically endangered and possibly already extinct in Britain, as they have not been seen since 1950 35 are placed on the new red list and considered either ‘critically endangered’, ‘endangered’ or ‘vulnerable’, and under threat of becoming extinct in Britain in the near future Stoneflies fare slightly better. Out of 34 species found in Great Britain, one is now extinct, one is vulnerable to extinction, and another now joins the red list as a critically endangered species. The 2 reports are the latest in a series to be published under the Species Status Project, which will help conservation organisations to target future action. The Species Status project is a new initiative that provides up-to-date assessments of the threat status of various species of insects using the internationally accepted guidelines developed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ). Both groups of insects are highly sensitive to their environment. Leaf beetles are often specific to certain plants in certain habitats. Stonefly larvae are particularly sensitive to organic pollution. They are regarded as excellent indicators of the health of the natural environment and targeted action supported by both Natural England and the voluntary conservation sector is underway to try to prevent further declines in these species. The reports provide vital new evidence that will help focus resources on managing habitats in the best way to improve the conservation status of these overlooked but important insects. Case studies Tansy beetle The rare and visually stunning iridescent green tansy beetle (Chrysolina graminis) was once widespread in the Britain living in wetland areas, but it is currently critically endangered, not just in the UK but across its worldwide range. It is now a conservation priority species in England (section 41) species, which means that public bodies have a duty to protect it, together with its habitat. It was believed to have one last remaining stronghold in the UK on a 30km stretch of the banks of the river Ouse in York, mainly eating tansy (Tanacetum vulgare), a perennial herb which has given the beetle its name. At their York site they complete their entire life cycle on and around the plant, beside riverbanks or in wetlands. The site (Clifton Ings and Rawcliffe Meadows) was confirmed as a Site of Special Scientific Interest in May last year, and work is underway to improve its habitat and control the increase of invasive species such as Himalayan balsam which has resulted in a decline in tansy plants over the past few decades. This has of course affected tansy beetle numbers. Recently another population of tansy beetle was discovered in in the East Anglian fens in July 2014 after a 40 year absence. The discovery at Woodwalton Fen National Nature Reserve ( NNR ) was significant as it demonstrates the resilience of the species when given the right conditions. Natural England has been working closely with partners on the Great Fen vision to create new habitat around the NNR , and with the Tansy Beetle Action Group (TBAG) to study how best to improve conditions for the beetle. Work underway also includes a recent re-introduction at Wicken Fen. Hazel pot beetle Pot beetles are a fascinating group of petal and leaf-eating beetles that get their name from the protective shell-like ‘pot’ that the larvae live in, created using their own droppings. A hazel pot beetle colony was found in Sherwood Forest in 2008. It was the first time the insect had been recorded in Sherwood Forest for 70 years. Management techniques underway include the nurturing of young birch as a food source. Ten-spotted pot beetle The ten-spotted pot beetle occurs on wetland on protected sites. Whilst the beetle’s numbers continue to be monitored, its future will be linked to the action plan for lowland raised bogs, its favoured habitat, and enhancing willow as a food source in its wetland home. Jon Webb, Senior Entomologist at Natural England said: “These reviews further build on our knowledge of the status of these species, helping us to focus our attention on managing our protected sites appropriately to support those most in need”. Steve Falk at Buglife said: “The recently published State of Nature Report showed that at least two out of three species of British wildlife are declining, and we know that many species of invertebrate have already become extinct in Britain. These reports will put a strong spotlight on those species that will become extinct over the next few decades unless we take positive action and try to reduce the many threats facing them.” The reviews can be found on Natural England’s publications catalogue: NECR161 - A review of the scarce and threatened beetles of Great Britain: The leaf beetles and their allies ; and NECR174 - A review of the stoneflies (Plecoptera) of Great Britain Background information Stoneflies, or Plecoptera from the Greek, “pleated wing” are an ancient group of insects, dating from 250 million years ago, with 2,500 known species worldwide. Unsung inhabitants of the freshwater world, their larvae can grow to over 30mm in length, making them among the largest invertebrates found in fresh water. Due to their high oxygen requirements, the larvae are particularly sensitive to organic pollution. Leaf beetles are important as ecological indicators due to the dependency of many species on complex factors such as vegetation structure. They are found in a much wider range of habitats then some other groups of insects such as butterflies, dragonflies and bumblebees. Monitoring their status and abundance can provide a very useful indication of the ecological ‘health’ of the natural environment.

/government/news/ancient-peatlands-to-grow-again,"Environmental Stewardship agreements will see vast expanses of Peak District and South Pennines peatlands restored. Ancient peatlands to grow again  Natural England Individual moorland business owners have signed up to 30 large Environmental Stewardship ( ES ) agreements which will see vast expanses of Peak District and South Pennines peatlands, home to extensive tracts of semi-natural moorland with upland heath and peat bog, birds of prey and wading birds, restored. The ES agreements will bring about £15 million of moorland restoration measures over the coming 3-5 years. They will allow for changes to management on 39,000 hectares of moorland, such as less heather burning and a return to traditional shepherding to help improve the moorland environment. Running through to 2024, the agreements will bring great benefits to water quality, wildlife, recreation and business through these restoration measures. Funding from the scheme will be of great importance in bringing upland Sites of Special Scientific Interest ( SSSIs ) into better condition. How it works Restoration management such as gully blocking, heather brash spreading and re-introduction of a wonderful moss called ‘Sphagnum’ will provide the following benefits: increased water retention on the SSSIs to sustain peat bogs and their special plant life and birds good conditions for grazing animals and grouse reduced peat erosion into reservoirs improved paths for recreation and reduction in disturbance to wildlife habitats slower run-off into rivers after downpours, reducing flood-risks more carbon retention in peat, which helps mitigate climate change Agreement holders can choose to organise the work themselves or collaborate with a specialist moorland conservation organisation such as the not-for-profit Moors for the Future Partnership. Natural England’s Chairman Andrew Sells said: “The end-result will be amazing - the peatlands will become active again providing long-lasting prosperity for the environment and businesses. There will be improvements for people and wildlife, cleaner water for surrounding cities, reduced flood risk, better public recreation and increased global carbon storage. What a fantastic way to work with rural businesses to undertake necessary regeneration and to harness benefits from the moorlands, whilst also enhancing the rural economy.” The scheme is also supported by the Moorland Association, which represents many owners. Peak District representative Simon Gurney welcomed the ambitious large-scale restoration plans, explaining the extensive experience and knowledge of land managers would be invaluable to the project’s long-term goals and success. He added: “By working collaboratively, changes and improvements can take place while safeguarding the land use which is essential to the economy of our internationally recognised moors.” More about the Private Lands Project Many new agreement holders are joining Moors for the Future’s Private Lands Project to deliver restoration. As more individuals join the project, a patchwork of special sites across neighbouring areas of private land come together to create large ‘landscape scale’ improvement for people and wildlife. Matt Scott-Campbell, the Private Lands Project Manager said: ““Moors for the Future is pleased to be working with five private land managers across the Dark Peak at Saddleworth, Crowden, Moscar, Peaknaze and Stalybridge.” “We look forward to more opportunities to work with private businesses to help achieve conservation on their land and to contribute to the landscape scale effort funded by Environmental Stewardship.”"

/government/news/national-nature-reserves-spring-into-life-on-englands-best-wildlife-sites,"As buds burst open around us, it’s a great time to go outdoors and enjoy our beautiful English springtime. National Nature Reserves: spring into life on England’s best wildlife sites  Natural England England’s National Nature Reserves ( NNRs ) are some of the best places for experiencing and enjoying wildlife and beautiful scenery. From our northern uplands, via coastal dunes, beaches, woodlands and wetlands, to the heathlands and downs in the south, there is something to interest everyone. These special sites protect a wide variety of habitats and are also home to some of our rarest, most spectacular wildlife in England. Most of the 224 reserves, 142 of which are managed by Natural England, are open throughout the year and are absolutely free to visit. You will probably live within an hour’s drive of a reserve and some can be reached by public transport. By their nature, many are in quiet, remote areas and whilst there is usually limited free parking, the nearest facilities are likely to be in nearby towns and villages. There are so many amazing NNRs to visit and include: stunning upland at Moor House-Upper Teesdale spanning the counties of Cumbria and Durham, where you may see black grouse, hear curlew and enjoy some spectacular moorland views the Stiperstones in Shropshire - an atmospheric heathland with magnificent rock formations and a variety of upland bird species some of Europe’s oldest living things in the form of the mystical ancient yew trees at Kingley Vale in West Sussex or enjoy the magical bubbling cascades and gnarled oak woodland of Golitha falls in Cornwall big skies and expansive views on a coastal walk at Saltfleetby to Theddlethorpe Dunes in Lincolnshire, looking out for spring migrant birds arriving from Africa and Europe rare natterjack toads can be heard as they make their way down from the dunes to their breeding pools at Ainsdale Sand Dunes in Merseyside glorious rolling Pewsey Downs in Wiltshire allow a stroll whilst enjoying the lilting song of skylarks the variety of habitats at Cavenham Heath in Suffolk which might see you lucky enough to spot an adder basking in the spring sunshine Find out which National Nature Reserves are on your doorstep and step out on a journey of discovery. The Countryside Code can also help you make the most of a visit – to respect, protect and enjoy the places you visit. There are also a number of activities throughout the year where you can join the reserve staff and volunteers as they lead nature walks and themed events or take part in volunteer activities to help manage the reserves.

/government/news/natural-england-statement-on-the-possible-reintroduction-of-lynx,"Any application to introduce lynx into England would need serious consideration in terms of its impact right across the UK. Natural England statement on the possible introduction of lynx  Natural England The Eurasian lynx has been absent from Britain for about 1300 years. As it is no longer recognised as a resident species, the release of lynx into the wild in Britain would be unlawful unless licensed. Natural England is the appropriate licensing body in England. So far Natural England has had a single preliminary meeting with the Lynx Trust’s legal advisers to describe the extensive process that would need to be undertaken before any licence submission could be considered. Any application to introduce lynx into England would need very serious consideration in terms of its impact right across the UK. If such an application were made, Natural England would consider it in line with prevailing legislation; international guidelines; following proper public consultation and evidence gathering, and taking into account any input from government. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) guidelines consider the socio-economic impacts of the introduction as well as impacts on the environment and the animals themselves."

/government/news/health-and-disease-in-relocated-wild-animals,"Conference celebrates 25 years of the Zoological Society for London and Natural England’s partnership on the Species Recovery Programme. Health and disease in relocated wild animals  Natural England An international conference reviewing and celebrating the role played by translocation - transferring species to suitable sites - in the conservation of wild animals, is being held at the Zoological Society for London ( ZSL ) on 14 to15 May 2015. The event marks a partnership between ZSL and Natural England, which spans a quarter of a century. During this time, 23 species including cirl bunting, field cricket and the dormouse have been given a better chance of survival because of translocation under Natural England’s Species Recovery Programme. In some cases this involved the reintroduction of species, such as the red kite, pool frog and large blue butterfly, which had previously been lost from England. The Species Recovery Programme involves working with a wide range of partners to target conservation action at those species identified as most in need of help. Ongoing habitat loss has meant that many wildlife habitats are now severely degraded and fragmented. As a consequence, 500 species have been lost completely from England over the past 200 years, including the mouse-eared bat, the Essex emerald moth, and Ivell’s sea anemone. Many of our native species are in decline, with more than 240 species now known on fewer than 5 sites including the reintroduced corncrake and short haired bumblebee. The scale of loss means that human intervention is sometimes needed to support the survival of species and to enable them to move between areas of habitat which can support them. The conference focuses on the vital role of health surveillance to successful translocations, by increasing the success rate and minimising the risk of adverse effects on other species. The importance of taking disease risk into account when moving species from place to place is now widely recognised, and has been reflected in protocols and guidelines such as those published by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Dr Tim Hill, Chief Scientist at Natural England said: You don’t need a crystal ball to see that translocations are likely to play an ever more important role in future. Our climate is changing rapidly and in some cases species will need a helping hand to cross hostile environments to reach areas where populations can remain viable. While many challenges remain, we are learning more about this complex subject all the time – and we are in a far better position to meet these challenges than we were 25 years ago.

/government/news/site-of-special-scientific-interest-status-for-london-parks-is-confirmed,"Two of London’s much-loved parks are recognised as being among the most important places for wildlife in England.  Site of Special Scientific Interest status for London parks is confirmed  Natural England Natural England has confirmed the designation of Bushy Park and Home Park in the London Borough of Richmond as a Site of Special Scientific Interest ( SSSI ). Bushy Park and Home Park were first notified as of SSSI quality last September and following a consultation period Natural England has now formally confirmed the designation of the site. SSSIs are the country’s best sites for wildlife and geology - there are more than 4,100 SSSIs in England, covering around 8 per cent of England. The Bushy Park and Home Park SSSI has been designated because of its internationally significant populations of rare insects, the exceptionally large numbers of ancient and veteran trees growing on the site, and the presence of extensive areas of special grassland habitat. The trees at Bushy Park and Home Park are survivors of a wood-pasture management that dates back to the 15th century. More than 200 veteran trees have been identified at the site of which 94 are classed as ancient. The site is one of only 44 sites nationally known to support more than 100 veteran trees and is the highest ranking of 10 comparable sites in the Greater London area. The trees include oak and lime with some horse chestnut and sweet chestnut and around 16 other species of tree. A notable feature is the occurrence of a large number of very old hawthorn trees, many of which are festooned with mistletoe. The great age of many of the trees also provides habitat for many rare species of wood feeding invertebrates and the site ranks amongst the top 5 in Britain for this highly specialised group of creatures, for which Britain has international importance. Natural England’s Chairman, Andrew Sells, said: Natural England is delighted to confirm Bushy Park and Home Park as one of London’s newest Sites of Special Scientific Interest. This is a very important site in the heart of London for its special natural habitats and rare species of wildlife. This accolade provides a great opportunity to enhance both the wildlife and people’s enjoyment of nature in one of London’s historic green spaces and to protect it for future generations. We’re pleased that the new designation has been supported by both the Royal Parks and Historic Royal Palaces and we looking forward to working with them over the future sympathetic management requirements of the special features of the site. The majority of the 540ha site is held in trust by the Crown Estate. Bushy Park is managed by The Royal Parks and Home Park by Historic Royal Palaces who have both welcomed the SSSI designation. Nicholas Mallory Garbutt, Tree and Wildlife Conservation Manager, Historic Royal Palaces, added: We are delighted that Home Park has received this recognition of its national significance for wildlife conservation. This historic deer park is a vital part of Hampton Court Palace’s history, which has been enjoyed by everyone from King Henry VIII, to the many visitors who flock to the Hampton Court Flower Show every year. The results of recent wildlife surveys show that the historic trees and acid grassland of the park provide an important habitat for wildlife conservation, and we look forward to working with Natural England to continue to preserve this environment for future generations. Ray Brodie, Manager of Bushy Park, Royal Parks, said: This is a great accolade for Bushy Park and confirms what we have long-known to be true; that Bushy Park is one of the finest sites in England for wildlife and ecology. Bushy Park contains many rare and important species and habitats including rare stag beetles and around 10 different species of bat. The Royal Parks works hard to conserve and protect this unique environment, while also ensuring that Bushy Park is a peaceful haven for the many thousands of visitors who come each year to relax, unwind and enjoy the natural surroundings.” The confirmation of the SSSI designation comes during London Tree Week 2015 which runs from 23 to 31 May and celebrates and explores London’s trees and woodlands with a series of special activities. About SSSIs A Site of Special Scientific Interest ( SSSI ) is one of the country’s very best wildlife and/or geological sites. SSSIs include some of the most spectacular and beautiful habitats: wetlands teeming with wading birds, winding chalk rivers, flower-rich meadows, windswept shingle beaches and remote upland peat bogs. There are more than 4,100 Sites of Special Scientific Interest ( SSSIs ) in England, covering around 8% of the country’s land area. More than 70% of these sites (by area) are internationally important for their wildlife and designated as Special Areas of Conservation, Special Protection Areas or Ramsar sites. SSSI status gives legal protection that ensures that the nationally important wildlife and geology of a site is recognised in its management and future use. Additional notes: A ‘veteran tree’ is usually in the second or mature stage of its life and has important wildlife and habitat features including; hollowing or associated decay fungi, holes, wounds and large dead branches. It will generally include old trees but also younger, middle aged trees where premature aging characteristics are present. The term ‘ancient tree’ refers to trees of interest biologically, aesthetically or culturally because of their great age; trees in the ancient or third and final stage of their life; and, trees that are the old relative to others of the same species. The site provides an abundance of dead and fallen timber and inside these trees there is a succession of fungi which actively break down the heartwood to produce a rich internal wood mould. This habitat, often deep within a large living tree, provides the perfect environment for specialised saproxylic (wood feeding) creatures. Saproxylic invertebrates are dependent on dead or decaying wood (or dependent on other organisms that are themselves dependent on dead wood). These invertebrates may not be dependent on the wood for their entire life cycle but at least some stage is dependent on wood. A good example of this are the larvae of some beetles that feed on decaying wood. The adults may feed on other things (such as nectar). Possibly the most well-known of Britain’s beetles is the stag beetle (Lucanus cervus) and the larvae of this impressive beetle are saproxylic. Bushy Park and Home Park SSSI , London Borough of Richmond was notified as an SSSI by Natural England on 5 September 2014. The site is located to the south west of London in the Borough of Richmond within the Thames Valley National Character Area: national grid reference TQ159692."
/government/news/the-nature-of-flight-takes-off-at-yorkshire-air-museum,"New film reveals fascinating story of Skipwith Common National Nature Reserve ‘The nature of flight’ takes off at Yorkshire Air Museum  Natural England A new film has been produced by Natural England and the Yorkshire Air Museum that reveals the fascinating history of the Royal Air Force station at Skipwith Common in North Yorkshire. Commissioned in 1942 as RAF Riccall and used as an airfield and training centre during World War 2, Natural England is now working with the landowners to manage Skipwith Common as England’s newest National Nature Reserve ( NNR ). The nature of flight film uses original archive footage and interviews, interspersed with beautiful new images of Skipwith Common, to reveal how nature is reclaiming the site and transforming it from a place of warfare into a peaceful haven for visitors. The film was made by Natural England’s NNR team, Phil Robinson and Craig Ralston, and was produced with the full support of the Eskrick Park Estate, who own Skipwith Common. Skipwith Common NNR is already an important home for rare species, such as the nocturnal flying nightjar and the insect-eating sundew plant. The old brick bomb bays are now a haven for grass snakes and other reptiles, while the air raid shelters and runways are gradually disappearing beneath a cloak of vegetation. David Shaw, Natural England’s area manager for Yorkshire and Northern Lincolnshire, said: Partnership working is at the heart of work at Skipwith Common and I’m delighted we’ve been able to work with the Yorkshire Air Museum and Allied Air Forces Memorial on this stunning film. Skipwith Common National Nature Reserve is now a peaceful place which is steeped in history. It is an important home for wildlife, shaped by generations of human activity and a living memorial to those who fought to protect our freedom and paid the ultimate price. The launch of this film reminds us of Skipwith Common’s past, present and future and is an excellent way of demonstrating what we can achieve for this wonderful site by closely working together. The film was premièred at the Yorkshire Air Museum on 25 May 2015 where it will be shown in a permanent display as a part of the museum’s nature of flight project. You can watch the 11 minute long film here and find more Natural England films on our YouTube channel YouTube Ian Reed, Museum Director said: As a history of aviation museum, our own “nature of flight” environmental area has enabled us to explain the story of the birth of flight from the earliest aviators and their study of flying insects and birds. As a national aviation memorial, the close partnership we have with Natural England and their success with the former wartime base at Riccall has enabled us to complete another chapter in the story of the extraordinary courage and sacrifice of wartime airmen 70 years ago.” Situated in a 22 acre parkland site on the former World War 2 RAF Bomber Command Station at Elvington near the City of York, the Yorkshire Air Museum and Allied Air Forces Memorial is the largest independent air museum in Britain. Natural England and the Yorkshire Air Museum have been working together for over a decade on landscape scale environmental projects encompassing the museum and the Lower Derwent Valley and Skipwith Common NNRs. Background Skipwith Common NNR is one of the last remaining areas of northern lowland heath in England. An incredible variety of plants and animals depend on the common for their survival. The 270ha of open heath, ponds and mire is an ancient landscape, with its roots in pre-history. Skipwith Common’s heathland has stayed almost the same for thousands of years – with evidence of its use by man for at least 4000 years. For thousands of years the heathland was kept open by people grazing their animals, taking birch, gorse, and cutting turf and peat for fuel. This digging peat has created the many ponds on the site. The common is dotted with Bronze and Iron Age features as well as much evidence of its more recent use during World War 2. During the war a bomber training airfield was constructed on the western end of the Common and much of the infrastructure, one of the runways, and other features survive both on and adjacent to the common on both north and south sides. These features mean there are good paths to use all year round. Today, the site is a National Nature Reserve owned and managed by Escrick Park Estate, in conjunction with Natural England and the Friends of Skipwith Common."
/government/news/missing-geltsdale-hen-harrier,"A male hen harrier has disappeared from Cumbria. Missing Geltsdale hen harrier  Natural England Natural England is very concerned to hear that a further male hen harrier has disappeared from Geltsdale in the north of England, resulting in its partner abandoning her nest. Whatever the cause of this loss, this is very serious for the English hen harrier population, which remains in the balance as a breeding species. Natural England continues its conservation efforts with partners including landowners, managers and other conservation organisations, to safeguard and monitor this precious population. Anyone who may have any information about the disappearance of this bird is urged to contact the police. Interference with hen harriers is a criminal offence."
/government/news/five-hen-harriers-have-now-disappeared-from-northern-england,"Another male hen harrier has disappeared from Bowland.   Five hen harriers have now disappeared from northern England  Natural England The loss of another male hen harrier in the last few days, brings the total to 5 within recent weeks. Natural England’s Hen Harrier Recovery Programme has been running for more than 10 years, and although we have recorded the disappearance of male birds in previous years, the loss of 5 within such a short period is unprecedented. Whilst all 5 nests were on land managed for conservation, we know that males roam across large areas of moorland when searching for food and this can make them more vulnerable. Rob Cooke, Natural England’s Director of Terrestrial Biodiversity said: The sudden loss of so many birds is of great concern and something that England’s fragile breeding hen harrier population may struggle to withstand. We are now pinning our hopes on the remaining handful of birds that still have active nests in northern England and are working closely with landowners and other conservation bodies to help ensure that they are successful. We will fit the latest high-tech satellite tags to any young, so that we can monitor their progress once they have left the nest. The use of satellite tags to track hen harriers is an approach that has been pioneered by Natural England over recent years. The technology is improving rapidly and we hope that the latest tags will provide even more detailed information on how birds move around the landscape and the factors currently limiting the population."
/guidance/wild-birds-remove-them-from-food-premises-using-nets-or-traps,"Find out how to use nets or traps to catch birds in food premises and safely release them within the terms of your licence. Wild birds: remove them from food premises using nets or traps Wildlife and habitat conservation Natural England If you have birds that won’t leave premises where food is prepared, you’ll need a licence to remove them safely and lawfully. You can only use these methods if you hold the relevant licence. If you don’t have a licence, you can register to catch birds on food premises if you’re the owner or manager. This licence doesn’t allow you to catch, relocate or disturb nesting adult birds, their eggs or their young. If you need to remove nesting birds as a health and safety emergency, contact Natural England for advice. Before using traps or nets Try to encourage the birds to leave your premises by: scaring them using trails of food switching off the interior lights If this doesn’t work, watch the movement and behaviour of the birds to plan where to place the nets or traps for best effect. Cage-traps Cage-traps allow you to safely catch birds and release them back into the wild. Where and when to put cage-traps Only place cage-traps where it’s safe to do so. You should position cage-traps: where birds feed and roost on the birds’ flight path where birds can easily enter the traps away from food and packaging out of sight of the public in a safe and secure location within easy reach The number of cage-traps you need will depend on the: size of the premises area affected by birds number of birds present number of safe and suitable places to put a cage-trap You must avoid catching birds when they are nesting (normally March to September, although pigeons and blackbirds may nest indoors all year round). How to use To use cage-traps effectively you should: remove or cover other sources of food stop customers or staff feeding the birds place traps out of sight of customers or staff avoid disturbing birds that are in or near to the traps encourage birds to fixed open traps with bait for 3 to 7 days to get them used to the cages move traps to better locations if the birds are not taking the test bait To avoid causing distress or injury to the birds you must check the traps a minimum of twice in a 24 hour period, with no longer than 12 hours between each inspection. You can try to attract birds to cage-traps by using: bait (food appropriate to the species and water) recorded bird-song at dawn or dusk artificial decoy birds mirrors paint the traps with drab colours to lure the most shy species You should release birds caught in cage-traps safely and unharmed. Recommended bait Under your licence you must provide suitable food and water in a cage-trap so that captive birds don’t suffer. If you use a trap that can catch multiple birds, you must provide enough food and water for the maximum number of birds that the trap is designed to catch. If you fail to do so, you may commit an offence under the Animal Welfare Act 2006. Suitable food and the species they attract include: fresh fruit and madeira cake for house sparrows mealworms that are contained or pinned down to prevent them spreading into premises for blackbird, robin and pied wagtail bird seed for house sparrow millet sprays for finches water – static and dripping sources for warblers You should bait cage-traps for up to 4 weeks to allow time for repositioning traps if the bait is not taken. Permitted cage-traps You can only use these cage-traps. Type of trap Suitable for Species they attract Split-perch trap, ‘Chardonneret’ trap small perching birds finches, robins, house sparrow Funnel trap or sparrow trap birds that walk or hop at ground level house sparrow Drop-door trap (‘stick and string’ operated trap) birds that walk or hop at ground level blackbirds, thrushes Drop or fall trap birds that hop at ground level thrushes, dunnock, starling Potter trap birds that walk or hop at ground level blackbirds, thrushes, robin, starling Inwardly-hinged or bob-wire trap larger birds pigeons Mist-nets You can catch birds in a fine black netting, known as a mist-net, and safely release them back into the wild. They’re most effective in enclosed buildings with low ceilings, but can work well in larger buildings if the operation is well planned. Mist-nets can only be used under licence by people trained and experienced to use them. How to use mist-nets You must check and seal any doors or windows into the premises. Only place mist-nets where it’s safe to do so. You may need to consider doing a risk assessment first. You should only put up mist-nets when the premises are closed to the public (eg early morning or late evening). Only trained and experienced staff should be present when the nets are in operation. You need to have at least one other experienced person helping you. Fix a mist-net across a frame or stretch it between 2 poles and position it: across the birds’ flight path, particularly where they feed and roost where the birds can be easily intercepted where it’s unlit and can’t be seen by the birds in a safe and secure location within easy reach of the operator of the nets where there is no public access or public present Mist-nets are less likely to be effective in: buildings with ducts and pipework in the ceiling where birds can escape above the gaps very large buildings with high ceilings buildings with several entry and exit points To avoid causing distress or injury to the birds you must: check mist-nets every 10 minutes whilst in use not cut free any trapped birds in case they fly off with netting attached to them not hold birds by their head, leg, wing or tail Safely release captured birds Captured birds are protected under the Animal Welfare Act 2006. You must make sure the birds are removed and released unharmed. Where to release the birds You should release healthy birds: in daylight, but not in late afternoon during winter at a suitable site at least 4 miles from your premises to reduce the risk of return; migratory birds, or species which regularly fly long distances should be released further away Birds that are nesting near to the premises should, however, be released immediately outside the buildings so that they’re not separated from their young. You must take any unhealthy or injured birds which you can’t kill under your licence to a veterinary surgeon. When to contact Natural England Contact Natural England by email: wildlife@naturalengland.org.uk or telephone: 0300 060 3900 for further advice, or to discuss your options if: birds are nesting within your premises you’ve failed to catch the birds after making every effort to do so"
/government/news/hen-harrier-breeding-season-set-to-be-most-successful-for-5-years,"Figures from the 2015 hen harrier breeding season show it is on track to be the most successful year since 2010.  Hen harrier breeding season set to be most successful for 5 years  Natural England Despite poor weather throughout the breeding season, there are 6 successful harrier nests fledging 18 new chicks. An additional seventh nest - which was close to fledging young - unfortunately failed late in the season, due to natural causes. Hen harriers remain the most endangered breeding birds in England. News of this year’s successful nests follows the disappearance of 5 male hen harriers, which resulted in the failure of their nests. Rob Cooke, Natural England’s Director of Terrestrial Biodiversity, said: “6 nests is a small number, but it is actually more than we have seen in total over the past 3 years – which is a significant and positive step forward. Obviously we need to see many more pairs of these iconic birds nesting successfully and we are actively looking at how we and our partners can build on this positive outcome in the future.” The nests range across the north of England, in Northumberland, Lancashire, County Durham and two in north western England. Dedicated staff from Natural England, Forestry Commission, RSPB and the Moorland Association have worked tirelessly with volunteer raptor workers, landowners and their staff to help bring about these results. Chairman of the Moorland Association, Robert Benson, said: “Grouse moor managers have played a significant role in protecting nests and this year’s success, which is very welcome. However, we need to do more for hen harriers. With government help, via a hen harrier action plan, numbers and the spread of nests next year could be even better, buffering the effects of poor weather and predation.” Fledged chicks are being fitted with satellite tags by the RSPB EU funded hen harrier LIFE+ project and by Natural England, and their progress closely monitored. Satellite tag technology is improving rapidly and these latest tags will provide even more detailed information on how birds move around the landscape and the factors which currently limit the population. RSPB board spokesman Stuart Housden said: “Whilst we’re very pleased some hen harrier chicks have fledged successfully this year, we must recognise there remains a long way to go to secure the species’ future as a breeding species in England. Harriers are still absent from vast swathes of suitable habitat, and are highly vulnerable to illegal persecution. Until this is addressed there is little prospect of a sustainable population in England’s uplands.” Tom Dearnley, Forestry Commission Ecologist, said: “We are thrilled there have been 2 successful hen harrier nests in Northumberland. We hope that this will mean many more successful years for breeding hen harriers on land the Forestry Commission manages. This success highlights the habitat value to the species.” Background Number of successful nests since 2010:   Successful nests Chicks fledged 2015 6 18 2014 4 16 2013 0 0 2012 1 4 2011 4 12 2010 6 18"
/guidance/geese-control-populations-of-problem-birds-under-licence,"Find out how to control wild geese populations using egg oiling or by round-up and culling, if you’re permitted to do so under the terms of your licence. Geese: control populations of problem birds under licence Wildlife and habitat conservation Natural England You can only use these methods to control wild bird populations if you hold the relevant licence . If you don’t have a licence, contact Natural England for advice. Use mineral oil to prevent eggs hatching You can stop the eggs of problem Canada and greylag geese from hatching using mineral oil (eg paraffin oil). Completely cover the eggs with mineral oil shortly after the eggs have been laid and return them to the nest. Where birds are nesting as part of a colony, regularly search for eggs to treat during the nesting period. Round-up and cull geese Problem geese can be controlled by rounding up and culling whilst they’re moulting. As the birds can’t fly at this time, you can catch them by constructing a pen and a funnel and moving the birds towards it. When to cull You should cull geese shortly after they’ve moulted their main wing feathers as they’ll be unable to fly for 3 to 4 weeks. This usually occurs between the end of May and the end of June. Where to cull Geese usually choose to moult near water. You can identify moult sites as there will normally be a large number of feathers found at the shoreline or on nearby land. Shortly before you carry out the cull, you should visit the site to check that the birds aren’t able to fly. Prepare the funnel and holding pen You should place the funnel and pen at a location which is regularly used by the geese to enter and exit the water. If possible, set up the funnel and pen at least a day before the cull is due to take place, so that the birds can get used to it. Use wire mesh and stakes to create the 2 arms of the funnel. These should run from the water’s edge to the entrance of the holding pen. You should build the holding pen at the end of the arms of the funnel. It should be large enough to hold the size of the expected catch. Cover the outside of the pen with sacking or similar material so that the birds won’t be alarmed by human presence when they’re inside the pen. Catch the geese Rounding-up the geese should take place at first light, although several catches can take place at different sites throughout the day. You’ll need at least 6 people for a small catch. Split your team so that you have some: in canoes on the water on the banks around the edge of the water to stop the geese escaping The canoeists should circle behind the geese and move them gently and steadily towards the funnel and the entrance to the pen. Once you’ve moved the geese out of the water and towards the entrance of the pen, the canoeists and those on the banks should be positioned at the water’s edge, along the width of the funnel. Continue to move the birds into the pen and close the gate once they’re inside. Leave the birds alone for a while to allow them to calm down. This will help prevent unnecessary suffering as the geese are protected by the Animal Welfare Act 2006 once they’re held within the pen. Cull the geese To avoid unnecessarily distressing the birds: don’t enter the pen deal with young birds first as they’re vulnerable to being trampled individually remove birds from the pen and kill them quickly and humanely, out of sight from the other birds Under your licence you can kill the birds by: using a geese despatcher shooting them, if you take all necessary precautions before using a firearm You’ll need an additional licence if you decide to kill the birds by lethal injection. Contact Natural England for more information. You must dispose of the carcasses responsibly. Contact your local council if you need further advice.

/government/news/confirmation-of-bolton-fell-and-walton-mosses-site-of-special-scientific-interest,"Natural England has confirmed the extension to the boundaries of Bolton Fell and Walton Mosses SSSI in Cumbria. Confirmation of Bolton Fell and Walton Mosses Site of Special Scientific Interest  Natural England The Board of Natural England has given its approval to confirm the notification of Bolton Fell and Walton Mosses Site of Special Scientific Interest ( SSSI ) in Cumbria. The decision was agreed by the Natural England Board meeting in open session on 4 November 2015. SSSIs represent the best sites for wildlife and geology and there are more than 4,100 SSSIs in England, covering around 8% of the country. SSSI status gives legal protection that ensures that the nationally important wildlife and geology of a site is recognised in its management and future use. Bolton Fell and Walton Mosses SSSI in Cumbria covers a large area of lowland raised peat bog - a nationally rare and threatened wildlife habitat - of which nearly 95% of the original area has been lost or significantly damaged in the United Kingdom. The site is of national and international importance for the evidence of environmental change recorded in its peat deposits, and for the range of rare wildlife which the habitat can support, including: a wide range of insects specialist plants that have adapted to living in bog habitat, including the insectivorous sundew birds such as snipe, merlin, curlew and lapwing small mammals, amphibians and reptiles Natural England’s Chairman, Andrew Sells, said: The evidence clearly shows that the lowland peat bog habitat and associated vegetation give this site real national importance and tremendous potential for further restoration and enhancement. Natural England’s Board has agreed that extending the boundary of the SSSI will make a significant difference towards that aim. In addition, peat sequences dating back to the early Holocene contain evidence for variations in climate and cultural change over time through their pollen records, dated via radio carbon analysis.” Cumbria’s peatbogs provide a unique historical environmental record, an archaeological treasure-trove and have an important function as a carbon store. Lowland raised peatbogs such as Bolton Fell Moss and Walton Moss have formed over many thousands of years through the growth and decay of sphagnum mosses, which are vital for the active formation of peat. Natural England’s Area Manager for Cumbria, Simon Humphries, said: I am delighted that the Natural England Board has given its approval to confirm the notification of Bolton Fell and Walton Mosses SSSI . Lowland raised bogs can provide a haven for rare wildlife as well as an important carbon store to help tackle climate change. Designation will help to ensure the restoration of this internationally important site. Bolton Fell and Walton Mosses SSSI was notified on 13 March 2015 under section 28C of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, as inserted by Schedule 9 to the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000. Previously, 2 SSSIs were notified covering some of the lowland raised peat bog habitats in the area - Bolton Fell Moss SSSI (last notified 2001) and Walton Moss SSSI (notified 1985). The newly confirmed Bolton Fell and Walton Mosses SSSI includes both of these previously notified SSSIs . The notification brings the special interests of the overall area within a single designation, combining the 2 previously notified SSSIs and with substantial extensions covering more than 460 ha. The Bolton Fell and Walton Mosses SSSI covers an area of just short of 1,000 ha. The long-term aim for the site is to re-establish an active peat forming bog surface within 30 years. The site will become a nature reserve for community use, education and enjoyment. Wider benefits include the site’s role in the provision of carbon storage and a study of the ecosystem services that it provides funded through the Cumbria BogLIFE project. Natural England’s Cumbria BogLIFE project brings new opportunities to showcase restoration techniques for lowland raised peatbogs, monitor the recovery process and to raise awareness of the importance and value of Cumbria’s remaining peatbog sites. The project will pioneer new ways for re-establishing bog vegetation on sites where peat has been extracted, which it’s hoped will become demonstration sites to showcase this approach to managers of peatbogs across Europe. Practical habitat management work is already underway at several lowland peatbog sites in Cumbria and further work will take place over the next 5 years, including on the Bolton Fell and Walton Mosses SSSI . Natural England is responsible for notifying SSSIs , ensuring they are managed appropriately and assessing and monitoring their condition."
/government/news/new-report-highlights-changing-fortunes-of-grasshoppers-crickets-and-allied-species,"Natural England has published a review of the current conservation status of Britain’s grasshoppers, crickets and related species of insects. New report highlights changing fortunes of grasshoppers, crickets and allied species  Natural England Evidence from the latest study into the conservation status of Britain’s grasshoppers, crickets and allied species reveals an “extraordinary change in the fortunes” of many species of these insects since 1997. A review of the orthoptera and allied species of Great Britain charts the fortunes of a fascinating but little known group of insects which are more often heard than seen. It has been published by Natural England in collaboration with the invertebrate conservation charity, Buglife, and is part of the UK’s species status project. These species of invertebrates are considered important indicators of the state of the natural environment. Many species are showing signs of range change in response to climatic change. They are also often highly specialised in their habitat requirements and are useful indicators of changes in habitat quality. Insects are also the essential foundation of many food chains and are vital to healthy ecosystems. The review has revealed that some once rare species have become considerably more widespread and abundant; while other species have declined in their former strongholds. Targeted conservation action supported by both Natural England and the voluntary sector is underway to try to prevent further declines in the rarest species. Natural England project manager, Jon Curson, said: “Invertebrates are integral to our natural environment, fundamental to the food chain and excellent indicators of the health of our natural habitats. Natural England supports the production of this kind of review to help share our data and improve the understanding of our rarest species and how best to conserve them and the habitats they live in for the future.” Sarah Henshall, lead ecologist at Buglife, added: “Orthoptera contains some of our most charismatic and spectacular species, from the impressive wart-biter cricket to the elusive mole cricket. They are a valuable indicator of the state of our environment, responding to changes in habitat quality and climate. The review highlights the importance of recording and conservation efforts undertaken by Buglife and other organisations.” The review highlights how carefully targeted species re-introduction programmes have been a vital lifeline for the wart-biter cricket (Decticus verrucivorus) and field cricket (Gryllus campestris). New populations of both species have been established in southern England, thanks to partnership work with local famers and other land managers. There is also some encouraging news for the once widespread mole cricket (Gryllotalpa grylloptalpa), which was thought to be extinct in Britain until a small population was discovered in Hampshire in 2014, although it is currently unclear whether any were recorded this year. The new review documents the appearance of 3 species new to Britain that have appeared as colonists, or potential colonists, on the back of northward European range expansions; and highlights the spectacular range expansions of species like the long-winged conehead (Conocephalus discolour) and Roesel’s bush-cricket (Metrioptera roeselii). The review includes detailed data sheets that are being made available for the first time to help focus resources on managing habitats in the best way to improve the conservation status of these insects. The report is the latest in a series to be made available as part of the species status project, which is publishing evidence-based reports that will help conservation organisations to target future action. The species status project is a new initiative that provides up-to-date assessments of the conservation status of various species of insects using the internationally accepted guidelines developed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Case studies: Wart-biter cricket (Decticus verrucivorus) The wart-biter cricket – which gets its name from the ancient Swedish medical practice of using the insects to eat skin warts – was once found across southern England. The cricket, which can grow up to 2 inches in length, has very exacting habitat requirements and requires a particular kind of grassland habitat that includes bare ground, short turf and taller clumps of grass. The new review classifies the wart-biter as an ‘endangered’ species in Britain. Wart-biter cricket numbers have declined as a result of loss of suitable grassland and changes in livestock grazing. The cricket is now found at only 5 locations in Britain (3 with native populations and 2 reintroduction sites). A captive breeding programme involving London Zoo, Natural England, Buglife and a partnership of environmental groups, landowners and farmers, has seen the wart-biter reintroduced at 2 sites in southern England. In addition, a translocation of wart-biters to a site in East Sussex where it had recently gone extinct was started in 2015. Monitoring over the next few years will confirm whether this project has been successful in providing a long-term lifeline to this rare insect. Field cricket (Gryllus campestris) Before re-introductions were undertaken as part of Natural England’s species recovery programme, the field cricket was found at only a single colony in West Sussex. There are now 6 re-introduced populations in 4 counties. Several of these re-introductions are very recent and it’s not yet known how sustainable they will be in the long-term. The current review suggest that although still classified as ‘vulnerable’ the species is spreading in at least 2 of the sites, with more re-introductions planned in the future. Mole cricket (Gryllotalpa gryllotalpa) With only 1 small and recently discovered colony currently known, the species is classified as ‘critically endangered’. Mole crickets live in wet soils in water meadows and wet heathlands and before the extensive land drainage that occurred in the 17th and 18th centuries the mole cricket was found widely in Britain. The species was thought to be possibly extinct in Britain until a small population was discovered in the New Forest in 2014. Although the situation remains critical for this subterranean cricket, it appears to be still holding on in one part of Britain and future management will involve monitoring the colony and maintaining suitable habitat. Long-winged conehead (Conocephalus discolor) Conocephalus discolor is quite widespread in southern and central Europe, and is spreading northwards. The species was first discovered in Britain in the 1940s and was only found around the south coast of England. In the 1980s there was dramatic population growth and the range of this bush-cricket expanded more than 150 miles in 20 years. Now the long-winged conehead can be found in many parts of the country beyond the River Thames, as far north as Humberside and as far west as Wales. The review suggests that the shift in the bush cricket’s distribution has occurred in response to climate change. Background information: The last comprehensive review of this group of insects was the Atlas of grasshoppers, crickets and allied insects in Britain and Ireland (Haes and Harding, 1997). The new review shows major changes in the status of some orthopteran species since 1997. About Natural England Natural England is the government’s advisor on the natural environment. Established in 2006 our work is focused on enhancing England’s wildlife and landscapes and maximising the benefits they bring to the public.

/government/news/status-review-of-some-of-britains-smallest-countryside-heroes-published,"Reviews of the conservation status of Britain's centipedes, woodlice, aquatic insects and similar species have been published by Natural England. Status review of some of Britain’s smallest ‘countryside heroes’ published  Natural England The most up to date reviews of the conservation status of some of Britain’s smallest but most ecologically important animals have been published by Natural England. A review of the Diplopoda, Chilopoda and Isopoda of Great Britain assesses the conservation status of centipedes, millipedes and woodlice and identifies the species that are considered to be ‘vulnerable’, ‘endangered’ or ‘critically endangered’. Despite their small size, millipedes and woodlice are the heroes of the British countryside, and especially our woodlands, where they provide an essential ecosystem service in helping with the decomposition of plant material. A review of the Hemiptera of Great Britain: The Aquatic and Semi-Aquatic Bugs covers a group of animals that include most children’s favourite pond dwellers; the pond skaters and water boatmen. There are 93 species covered in the new review nearly all of which are either aquatic or are found in damp habitats usually close to water. These animals occur in a wide range of habitats in Britain - from the ditches of Sussex to river banks in the Cairngorms. Much of the data used to produce these latest reviews has been provided by a network of volunteer observers along with records from conservation and environmental organisations. Natural England project manager, Jon Webb, said: These small animals are often overlooked but they have evolved to fill an important ecological function that we take for granted. They are fundamental parts of the food web that supports other life and are also excellent indicators of the health of our natural habitats. They are also important in their own right, being fascinating creatures with a biology and ecology alien to us. We need to be their custodians and endure that they are not lost on our watch. Natural England supports the production of this kind of review which helps disseminate a wide range of datasets that help to increase understanding of biodiversity and can lead to further research and innovation. Both groups of minibeasts are highly sensitive to their environment and are regarded as excellent indicators of the health of the natural environment. Paul Lee, Research Co-ordinator of Hymettus, who undertook the review, said: This is the first time we have had a comprehensive assessment of the importance of these often overlooked groups and is testament to the vital contribution the volunteer recorders of the British Myriapod and Isopod Group make to nature conservation in Britain. Both reviews include detailed data sheets for threatened species to help focus resources on managing habitats in the best way and to improve the conservation status of these overlooked but important animals. The 2 reports are the latest in a series to be published under the species status project, which will help conservation organisations to target future action. The project is a new initiative that provides up-to-date assessments of the threat status of various species of insects using the internationally accepted guidelines developed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

/guidance/public-rights-of-way-local-authority-responsibilities,"As a local highway authority (usually a county council or national park authority) you have statutory duties to record and keep public rights of way open. Public rights of way: local highway authority responsibilities Access and rights of way Natural England Recording routes and locations Highway authorities must keep a record of public rights of way and make sure they are open for public use. The legal record of a highway authority’s rights of way network is known as the ‘definitive map and statement’. Rights of way circular (1/09) explains the highway authority’s statutory duty to record, manage and maintain, protect and change public rights of way. The guide to definitive maps and changes to public rights of way has more detail about your legal duty to record public rights of way. Maintaining and protecting public rights of way The highway authority must: keep the surface of public rights of way which are maintained at public expense in a fit state for public use make sure obstructions are removed maintain some bridges over natural watercourses, including farm ditches provide at least a 25% contribution to landowners’ costs for replacing and maintaining structures for the control of animals, eg gates or stiles, on completion of the work to a standard the highway authority is satisfied with make sure there are no notices that prevent or discourage the use of a public right of way add signs where a public right of way leaves metalled roads make sure the public’s rights to use a public right of way are protected make sure landowners carry out their duties, and take action if they don’t Removing obstructions It’s an offence to obstruct or block a public right of way. Anyone can report an obstruction to the local authority and request that it is removed. You must: respond to all requests within 1 month to confirm receipt contact the person who complained to tell them what action you’re taking make sure the obstruction is removed, either by the local authority or the person responsible for it (you can charge them a fee to remove it) If you haven’t removed the obstruction within 2 months of you writing to the person who complained they can apply for a court order to have it removed. The magistrates’ court may then take out an order against the local highway authority for the removal of the obstruction. Guidance on maintaining public rights of way Read the following guides to help with maintaining public rights of way: Rights of way circular (1/09) Waymarking public rights of way Definitive maps and changes to public rights of way Rights of way improvement plans Most highway authorities will already have a rights of way improvement plan. You must review the plan every 10 years. You should also monitor your progress towards implementing it and meeting targets you have set. Read the guidance on rights of way improvement plans for information on how to prepare, publish, assess and review your plans. Protecting wildlife and habitats While carrying out maintenance or improvements, you must have regard for the conservation of biodiversity. Read section 6.32 of rights of way circular (1/09) for more detail. A highway authority has the power to divert a public right of way from a Site of Special Scientific Interest ( SSSI ) if public use of it is causing damage to the special features of the SSSI . For further information, read the guide on SSSI : public body responsibilities . Access and equality for disabled users You must consider the needs of people with mobility problems and other disabilities. Section 5.4 of the rights of way circular (1/09) gives more detail about the requirements. There are no mandatory requirements for how to approve structures on a public right of way, but you must comply with the Equality Act 2010 . Improvements You should make improvements to public rights of way so they are accessible to all users, eg stiles should be replaced with gaps or gates, wherever possible. Before making improvements you should consider the: historical character of existing structures and the landscape needs of other users, eg parents with children in pushchairs accessibility of the route as a whole needs of the landowner - you should negotiate with the landowner to make improvements to existing structures New structures When creating a new public right of way or diverting an existing one you should: keep the number of structures to a minimum - there must be a reason for each one use the most accessible type of structure available, eg a gap or gate rather than a stile detail each type (standard and design) of structure clearly in the legal documentation - you might need to refer to this in future if the use of the land changes or if you need to prove why certain structures were used You must record any new structures on the definitive map and statement. Policies You should develop a policy about structures on public rights of way either as part of your Rights of Way Improvement Plan or as part of a wider policy on the Equality Act. Make sure that the policy states that structures on public rights of way must be built to the most accessible standard possible. Recording historical public rights of way (pre-1949) Your duty to keep public rights of way open and record their location also applies as much to historical public rights of way. A stakeholder working group on unrecorded public rights of way, commissioned by Natural England, made a range of agreed recommendations to government in 2010 . The recommendations are intended to: find out where pre‐1949 public rights of way exist and prevent them from disappearing make the procedure for recording historical public rights of way simpler and easier to understand make procedures more flexible to reduce any conflict with modern land use set a high level of performance for all local authorities reduce unreasonable objections encourage authorities to look for ways to integrate the management and administration of the highways network"

/guidance/open-access-land-management-rights-and-responsibilities,"As a land owner or manager, find out about your responsibilities and how public access can be managed. Open access land: management, rights and responsibilities Access and rights of way Natural England Overview The Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 ( CROW Act) normally gives a public right of access to land mapped as ‘open country’ (mountain, moor, heath and down) or registered common land. These areas are known as ‘open access land’. Much of the ‘coastal margin’ that is being created as part of the work to implement the England Coast Path ( ECP ) , is also open access land under the same Act. Even within land of these types there are some exceptions to the access rights, as explained below. You can find out if your land has a public right of access under the CROW Act using the online maps . What people can do on your land People can normally access your open access land on foot. They can: walk sightsee bird-watch climb run Visitors to your land can carry out any activities allowed by the law on footpaths, bridleways and other public rights of way, or unless you give them permission to do something on the list below or the right to do something exists already. There is a general rule that visitors using their open access rights must keep dogs on a short lead of no more than 2 metres between 1 March and 31 July each year (except in the coastal margin) and at all times in the vicinity of livestock. In the coastal margin, dogs must be under effective control at all times. In some circumstances you may be entitled to exclude people with dogs completely from small lambing fields and grouse moors. See the restrictions guidance for more information. What people can’t do on your land The CROW Act has a list of ‘general restrictions’ that limit what people using their open access rights may do, unless you give them permission to do something on the list, or the right to do something already exists. They can’t: ride a horse or bicycle drive a vehicle (unless it is an invalid carriage) bring an animal, other than a dog camp play organised games hang-glide or paraglide use a metal detector run commercial activities on the land such as: trade or sell charge other visitors for things they do on your land film, photograph or make maps remove, damage, or destroy any plant, shrub, tree or root with intent light, cause or risk a fire damage hedges, fences, walls, crops or anything else on the land leave gates open, that are not propped or fastened open leave litter disturb livestock, wildlife or habitats with intent post any notices commit any criminal offence Land that doesn’t have public access Public access rights under the CROW Act don’t apply to your land if it’s ‘excepted land’. Excepted land may still appear on CROW Act maps . This is explained below: buildings and their curtilage, eg courtyards land within 20 metres of a dwelling or building containing livestock parks and gardens land covered by structures like electricity substations, wind turbines or telephone masts (though this does not prevent use of access land around them) quarries and other active mineral workings railways and tramways golf courses and race courses aerodromes land being lawfully developed in one of the ways above land ploughed for the growing of crops or trees within the past year temporary livestock pens racehorse training gallops – at certain times land under Military Byelaws, eg most Ministry of Defence training areas Excepted land is still out of bounds to the public even if it appears as open access land on CROW Act maps Some of the exceptions listed above apply differently within the coastal margin. See manage your land in the coastal margin for more detail. Your liability to the public Unless you set out to create a risk, or are reckless about whether a risk is created, you are not liable for any injury caused by: any natural feature of the landscape (including any tree, shrub, plant, river, stream, ditch or pond, whether natural or not), or people passing over, under or through a wall, fence or gate, except if they are making proper use of a gate or stile. In the coastal margin next to the ECP , you are not liable for any injury caused by any physical feature on the land, whether it is a natural feature of the landscape or a man-made one. The interpretation of the legislation on liability to the public is a matter for the courts to decide. Anyone seeking legal advice on a particular case is advised to consult a lawyer. For more information see Liabilities on coastal margins which has been developed by the Country Land and Business Association with input from Natural England and Defra. Charges You can’t charge visitors for access but you can charge for goods, services and facilities, eg parking and entry to attractions. Development on your land You can develop your land subject to approval from your local planning authority. Contact Natural England about your plans if your development may affect the ECP or a site of special scientific interest (SSSI). Manage public access on your land You can use either informal measures such as signing, or legal restrictions, to manage public access and avoid conflict with your land management activities. Often, informal measures such as signs or verbal requests, can be more effective because: they can be put in place at short notice; unlike legal restrictions, they don’t require advanced notice or approval before you can use them restrictions only affect land which has been mapped under the CROW Act; they don’t apply to public rights of way or on other forms of public access to the land, whereas informal management can be used in all situations where it’s useful visitors are more likely to follow informal management techniques if you use these to suggest what people can do, rather than a legal restriction which tells them what they can’t do your reduced occupier’s liability doesn’t apply when legal restrictions are in place If informal measures don’t work, you might be able to restrict public access. See the detailed guide to restricting public access for more information. If you apply for a restriction lasting more than 6 months, the public will be given the opportunity to comment. Potential restrictions open to public comment are published on the consultation page . You can mark the boundaries of open access land with the access symbol. The ECP will be signed with the National Trails ‘acorn’ symbol. See the Countryside Code for more information about these symbols. It is an offence to display signs or notices that contain false or misleading information. Open your land for public access If you own land, or hold a lease which has more than 90 years left to run, you can voluntarily create public access rights by dedicating the land under section 16 of the CROW Act . This dedication is permanent (or, where appropriate, lasts for the duration of the long lease), so the rights will continue to apply when you no longer own the land. You can use a dedication to: provide a legal public right of access to land (eg woodland) that would not otherwise be covered by the CROW Act make sure that public access remains available even if the land ceases to be open access land by any other means allow public access to areas in the coastal margin that are usually excepted land You can also allow additional recreational activities to take place on your open access land by relaxing or removing one or more of the general restrictions , for example to allow people to ride horses. This can be done either through a permanent dedication, or by agreeing to a ‘direction’ that makes this change indefinitely or for a specified period of time. Contact the Open Access Contact Centre for further advice on dedicating land or relaxing or removing general restrictions. Public access enforcement Your ‘access authority’ (the local authority, or where relevant the national park authority) oversees access rights under the CROW Act in your area. They can advise you on managing access if you are having problems. They also have powers to deal with any unnecessary obstruction of access, or to improve ways for people to get into areas of access land. To find out who your access authority is, search for your local council on GOV.UK. Review of open access maps There is a requirement for Natural England to complete a statutory review of the maps of ‘open country’ and registered common land under section 10 of the CROW Act. The deadline for doing this has been deferred by regulations. The 8 maps covering England need to be reviewed by the relevant date for each area in 2019 and 2020, 15 years after their first issue by the Countryside Agency. Subsequent review deadlines will be 20 years after the previous review. Information about how to engage with the review process will be added here when appropriate. Access land in Wales and Scotland Natural Resources Wales is responsible for implementing the CROW Act in Wales. The CROW Act does not apply in Scotland. In Scotland, Part 1 of the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003 came into force in February 2005. This established a statutory right of responsible access over most areas of land and inland water.

/guidance/catchment-sensitive-farming-reduce-agricultural-water-pollution,"How to get free advice and training to reduce diffuse water pollution from agriculture and claim for capital grants under the Countryside Stewardship water capital grants scheme. Catchment Sensitive Farming: reduce agricultural water pollution Land management Rural grants and payments Natural England Overview Catchment Sensitive Farming ( CSF ) is a project run by Natural England in partnership with the Environment Agency and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. It raises awareness of diffuse water pollution from agriculture ( DWPA ) by giving free training and advice to farmers in selected areas in England. The selected areas are called priority catchments. The aim of the advice is to improve the environmental performance of farms. CSF is staffed by trained, qualified and experienced advisors. The advice is confidential and not disclosed to other parties. Advice is available in priority catchment areas only. The selected catchments are those where improvements in water quality will make the greatest contribution under the Water Framework Directive objectives. CSF complies with Article 22 of Commission Regulation (EU) No 702/2014 on how it gives advice. The amount of aid given for advisory services is limited to 1,500 euros per farmer per advisory theme. Countryside Stewardship Catchment Sensitive Farming is now working with farmers in selected areas to provide Countryside Stewardship grants. Funding to improve water quality is now available through the Countryside Stewardship Mid Tier application process. See the Mid Tier page for more information. Some Countryside Stewardship capital items require written support from a Catchment Sensitive Farming officer ( CSFO ) as part of the application evidence requirement. Check the capital item requirements on the Mid Tier page to find out when this is necessary. Endorsement of a Mid Tier application by a CSFO will increase the chance of success for holdings targeted for water quality outcomes. Applicants who require this support must contact and arrange a pre-application visit with CSF by 12 August 2016. After this date CSFO ’s cannot guarantee support during the 2016 application round. How to apply for training and advice All CSF training and advice aims to give practical and cost-effective solutions to improve water quality through: workshops demonstrations farm walks farm events one-to-one advice on solutions from groundwater protection to whole farm appraisals You need to be in one of the priority catchment areas to qualify for training and advice. Contact your Catchment Sensitive Farming officer for more information. Training topics Topics are tailored to the area and farming sector but include: manure management nutrient management soil condition pesticide management farm infrastructure You’ll also learn about: silage, slurry and agricultural fuel oils regulations ( SSAFO ) cross compliance Nitrate Vulnerable Zones ( NVZ ) Get further CSF information by downloading one of the related publications and documents .

/government/news/huddersfield-retailer-fined-for-rotten-fruit-and-vegetables,"A Huddersfield retailer has been fined after admitting displaying rotten and incorrectly labelled fruit and vegetables for sale in his store. Huddersfield retailer fined for rotten fruit and vegetables  Rural Payments Agency A Huddersfield retailer has been fined after admitting displaying rotten and incorrectly labelled fruit and vegetables for sale in his store. Sadaqad Ali, age 44, who owns Haji Food Store, in Blacker Road, Birkby, Huddersfield, admitted 14 offences of breaching EU marketing standards for fresh horticultural produce when he appeared at Kirklees Magistrates’ Court on Thursday (13/4). Inspectors working for the Horticultural Marketing Inspectorate ( HMI ), part of the Rural Payments Agency ( RPA ), visited the shop in May last year. On May 2 they identified seven products that were not compliant with rules relating to quality and labelling. A further seven offences were identified on May 22 during a further inspection made at the store. These visits followed a number of separate inspections made over a 12 month period where inspectors had provided regular guidance to Mr Ali to help him understand and meet the requirements of the regulations. Among the fruit and vegetables in question were rotten red onions, strawberries, cucumbers, spinach and carrots; shrivelled apples; and sweet peppers, mushrooms, apples and melons which did not have a country or origin on their labels. As a result of the breaches, Mr Ali was fined £100 for each of the 14 counts and ordered to pay £1,000 contribution to costs and a £20 victim surcharge. RPA Operations Director Paul Caldwell said: “This is just part of the wide range of work that RPA undertakes to protect consumers. “Customers should have trust and confidence that they get what they pay for when handing over their money. Fresh produce should be good quality and labelled accurately and the HMI work is very important in ensuring that these standards are maintained. “Prosecution is a last resort and we always try to gain compliance with quality and labelling regulations through targeted advice, guidance and instruction.” Notes to Editors: Haji Food Store is located at 55 Blacker Road, Birkby, Huddersfield. The offences involved in this investigation relate to regulated produce listed within the Specific Marketing and General Marketing Standards, contrary to Reg. 4(1) of the Marketing of Fresh Horticultural Produce Regulations 2009 (as amended). The HMI is part of the Rural Payments Agency ( RPA ). The Inspectorate is responsible for the enforcement of the EU marketing standards for fresh fruit, vegetables, salad crops, nuts and cultivated mushroom, throughout England and Wales, wherever fresh produce is grown, imported, exported, bought or sold. HMI operates a transparent risk-based approach to enforcement and has the principle aim of gaining cooperation and compliance from the trade it regulates at all stages of the distribution chain. Prosecutions are only taken as a last resort when all other options of education and advice have been exhausted. The Inspectorate follows the Hampton procedures of identifying and isolating any persistent and blatant offenders. The ultimate sanction of prosecution is then used as a clear deterrent to others who may look to break the EU marketing rules in order to obtain an advantage over other commercial competitors. Further information about the work of HMI can be found on RPA ’s website at rpa.defra.gov.uk RPA is an Executive Agency of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs ( Defra ), providing a range of key services in support of the department’s objectives, including making rural payments, carrying out rural inspections, and livestock tracing.

Eligibility for the school milk subsidy scheme School milk scheme Rural Payments Agency The EU school milk subsidy scheme encourages children to develop a lifelong habit of consuming milk and milk products. It does this by subsidising the cost of milk and yoghurt products for school children in the UK so that it can be sold to them at a lower price. Who is eligible for subsidised products Claims can be made by schools, local authorities, suppliers or organisations set up for this purpose. In England, Scotland and Wales the school milk subsidy scheme is administered by the Rural Payments Agency ( RPA ). Within these areas all pre-school children who are under 5 and in day care are eligible for free milk. This is organised by Nursery Milk Reimbursement Unit . Pupils regularly attending Ofsted -registered pre-school, nursery, primary or secondary school are eligible for subsidised milk. Pupils regularly attending Ofsted -registered primary or secondary school are also eligible for subsidised milk products and yoghurt. Additionally, in Wales, children in Key Stage 1 are eligible for free milk, funded by the Welsh Assembly government. Not covered by the scheme The scheme does not cover: children in pre-school establishments where the milk has been fully reimbursed under the Nursery Milk Scheme pupils in further education colleges pupils in higher education colleges or universities pupils in holiday camps boarding pupils on days when they’re not receiving formal education You can make claims for ‘rising fives’ in primary education reception classes either through the Nursery Milk Scheme or as part of your RPA claim.

/guidance/import-and-export-plants-and-fresh-produce,"When importing plants or fresh fruit and veg from outside the EU into the UK for commercial use, there are certain steps you must take.  Import and export plants and fresh produce Import, export and distribution of food Rural Payments Agency To import or export fresh fruit and vegetables from or to countries outside the EU, you need to: use the Trade Tariff tool to: find the reference number known as the TARIC code for the specific product (eg ‘fresh clementines’ or ‘fresh strawberries’) see what taxes you need to pay and procedures you need to follow for the product (eg some goods need certificates to show they comply with rules on plant health and product quality) register with CHIEF (Customs Handling of Import/Export Freight) , HMRC ’s online system for processing imports and exports follow any other rules that apply to the product, eg: safety considerations organic standards restrictions on importing from certain countries of origin To import or export produce covered by plant health regulations and/or the EU’s marketing standards you will also need to register with PEACH (Procedure for Electronic Application for Certificates) . The PEACH system allows you to: pre-notify the Plant Health and Seeds Inspectorate (PHSI) if you plan to import produce that is subject to plant health regulations and obtain quarantine release certificates once consignments have arrived and been inspected get and manage certificates of conformity (required to import and export certain types of fruit and vegetables) from the Horticultural Marketing Inspectorate ( HMI ) TARIC codes and the UK Trade Tariff tool Every product that is imported or exported has a TARIC code. These codes are EU-wide reference numbers that you will need to quote when you report about your goods to the relevant bodies. The UK Trade Tariff tool allows you to look up TARIC codes and access authoritative information about import and export rules, including: the rates of duty that are payable by importers information about restrictions or conditions that apply when importing this product contact details for the organisations involved The Trade Tariff tool is constantly updated with the latest information on products. The CHIEF system and DUCR numbers CHIEF allows business users to deal with customs electronically. For each consignment that you are importing or exporting, CHIEF will generate a Declaration Unique Consignment Reference ( DUCR ). You will need the DUCR number for various purposes, including to use PEACH . The CHIEF and PEACH systems communicate with each other via the Automatic Licence Verification System , making the import and export process smoother and quicker. Other rules on food imports The Food Standards Agency ( FSA ) provides information on importing food from outside the EU , including: GRAIL , a searchable database of information about import conditions, laws and guidance notes Trade Information Sheets with details of issues that importers and exporters should be aware of (eg pesticides, contaminants and packaging safety), and the organisations responsible details of the FSA ’s imported food enquiry service There are also specific procedures for importing organic products from countries outside the EU . Who should use PEACH You should use PEACH if: your business is in England and Wales your business is in Scotland or Northern Ireland but you are importing or exporting goods via England or Wales Traders importing or exporting directly to or from Scotland should contact the Scottish Government Rural Payments and Inspections Directorate on 08457 741 741. Traders importing or exporting directly to or from Northern Ireland should contact the DARD helpline on 028 9052 4999. Register with PEACH Before you use PEACH for the first time, you need to: register for a PEACH account register with the Government Gateway Entering your company name, address and contact details into the PEACH registration form will generate your company ID. This is the first of two pieces of information, or ‘known facts’, which PEACH uses to identify you. Once your application has been approved, you are sent your trader number, which is the second known fact. Keep these two pieces of data as you will need them to log in to PEACH . Next, register on the Government Gateway website if you are not already registered to access another government service online. When you register, it is a good idea to print out the screen containing your new user ID and keep it in a safe place. You’ll need your Government Gateway user ID and password to log in to the PEACH system for the first time. You can download a [InlineAttachment:1]. Add or remove an agent on the PEACH system If you’re a trader, you can employ an agent to use the PEACH system on your behalf. If you want someone to start or stop using the PEACH system on your behalf, contact the PEACH helpdesk . You’ll need to confirm your details, making it clear that you’re the trader and not the agent. Produce which must have a certificate of conformity The 10 fruits and vegetables covered by the Specific Marketing Standard ( SMS ) on quality and labelling require a certificate of conformity when they are imported to show that they comply with the standards. They are: apples citrus fruit kiwi fruit peaches and nectarines pears strawberries table grapes lettuces, curled-leaved and broad-leaved endives sweet peppers tomatoes You must apply for a certificate of conformity if you are planning to import these goods. Produce which may need a certificate of conformity HMRC ’s CHIEF system for processing imports and exports selects 1% of consignments of produce covered by the EU’s General Marketing Standard ( GMS ) to go through the process for getting a certificate of conformity. If one of your consignments is selected, you’ll get an email telling you to apply for a certificate of conformity on PEACH . Depending on the results of a risk assessment, the consignment could also be inspected. Green bananas Although bananas are not covered by either the specific or general marketing standards, there are special rules for bananas imported from outside the EU prior to ripening. You must notify HMI via PEACH about imports of unripened bananas arriving at UK points of entry. After risk assessment, some consignments will be held for HMI inspection. You can apply for exempted banana-trader status. Exempted traders’ consignments will be automatically cleared, except for a very small random sample selection. For more information about exempted banana-trader status, contact your Regional Horticultural Inspector. These requirements do not apply once fruit has been ripened. Apply for a certificate of conformity Importers normally get certificates of conformity electronically via PEACH . You should apply by logging in to PEACH and giving details of: what you are importing or exporting where and when it will arrive where and when it will be available for inspection the Declaration Unique Consignment Reference ( DUCR ) number You can make a paper application for a Certificate of Conformity. Request a form by contacting the PEACH helpdesk. Under normal circumstances, a paper application is treated as high risk, triggering a physical inspection that could lead to delays before customs clearance. The inspection itself is free but the applicant for the certificate is responsible for any port or airport charges incurred. Approved trader status If you are an importer and your business consistently demonstrates a high level of conformity with the marketing standards, HMI can grant you approved trader status ( ATS ). This means that you are identified as low risk, and will be subject to fewer inspections. For more information about ATS , [InlineAttachment:2]. Produce with a certificate of conformity issued in the country of origin In certain cases, you can apply for a certificate of conformity from the inspection authority in the country of origin. You must still make an application through PEACH for these consignments – the application process lets you indicate that the consignment already has a certificate. HMI inspects a random sample of consignments arriving with certificates of conformity that were issued in the country of origin. Traders or their agents must make these certificates available to HMI and/or HMRC if required. The table below lists the countries and types of produce this applies to. Country Type of produce Switzerland fresh fruit and vegetables other than citrus fruit Morocco fresh fruit and vegetables South Africa fresh fruit and vegetables Israel fresh fruit and vegetables India fresh fruit and vegetables New Zealand apples, pears and kiwi fruit Senegal fresh fruit and vegetables Kenya fresh fruit and vegetables Turkey fresh fruit and vegetables If PEACH is unavailable If PEACH is down for more than a short time, there is a paper-based contingency system. If you are registered on PEACH you will get a rapid alert by email and text message telling you that you need to move to the paper system and communicate with official bodies by fax. Download a [InlineAttachment:3]. Inspections When you apply for a certificate of conformity, PEACH assigns your consignment to a risk category, using the Import Risk Assessment System (IRAS). This risk assessment can take place up to 5 days in advance of the produce arriving. The risk categories are: red for high risk – where possible, all consignments in this category are physically inspected amber for medium risk – an inspector will decide whether a physical inspection is necessary green for low risk – these consignments are automatically granted a certificate of conformity Physical inspections usually take place at the point of entry of your consignment. However, if you apply for - and meet - the requirements of the local clearance procedure within Customs Freight Simplified Procedures (CFSP), the inspections may be at your own premises. If your imported goods are covered by both marketing standards and plant health regulations, your consignment will only be inspected once. Inspectors from HMI and PHSI are able to carry out inspections for both purposes and will contact the other organisation if they find a problem it should deal with. If your application is approved If the consignment is assessed as low-risk or if it passes inspection, then: its status is updated on PEACH the application is electronically matched to the CHIEF application and will clear customs If your application is not approved If an inspector finds missing or incorrect labelling information or quality issues with your consignment: HMI will notify the PEACH applicant (usually by phone) and will issue a refusal of entry certificate (HCG3) you must decide what action you want to take to bring the goods into conformity with the marketing standards (eg by amending the labelling or designating the produce for a different use) you must complete form HCG4 in PEACH telling the inspector what action you will take and where it will take place If you correct the problem at the import point: you should notify the inspector when the action has been taken the inspector will re-inspect the consignment and issue a certificate of conformity if it passes If the problem is to be corrected somewhere else: you will need to ask the inspector to approve the new destination if it doesn’t already have full PCC status to process under customs control you and the inspector will need to agree on a date and time for re-inspection the inspector will re-inspect the consignment and issue a certificate of conformity if it passes if the inspector issues a paper certificate, you will need to send it to HMRC ’s National Clearance Hub to gain clearance for the consignment The produce won’t be allowed into free circulation until a re-inspection has taken place and a certificate of conformity issued. If you don’t apply for a certificate If you bring a consignment of fruit or vegetables into the UK from a non-EU country without applying for certificate of conformity, the goods won’t clear customs and will be held at the point of import. You will have to pay any subsequent airport or port charges. If you misuse PEACH deliberately If you don’t keep to the rules for declaring imports and exports (eg if you make false declarations), HMI could take enforcement action. This could include suspending you from using PEACH or increasing the risk level for your consignments. Make the most of PEACH PEACH has various features to improve your efficiency and help move your consignments through customs as quickly as possible. PEACH automatically saves applications. If they are part-filled, they are saved for completion later - if they are completed, they are saved under ‘Use a previous form’, so that you can re-use them as templates for other applications. If you would like other people in your business to access your PEACH system, you can set up assistants on your Government Gateway account. However, assistants have limited access rights. They can’t enrol in new Gateway services or create or delete other assistants or users. This can be useful if you use other systems on the Government Gateway but do not want your assistants to have access to that information. If you have a large number of applications, PEACH lets you: perform bulk uploads from your system to PEACH . You can download reference information to help you generate this file from the PEACH website see statistics based on your applications, which can provide useful data, eg why your consignments have been given a high-risk assessment see all of your outstanding applications, with their current risk assessment locate a specific application - outstanding or completed – by entering the application number into PEACH ’s search Contact If you need help or advice on using PEACH , you can contact the helpdesk: call 0345 607 3224 email peachenquiries@rpa.gsi.gov.uk The helpdesk is open 7am to 10pm Monday to Friday and 8am to 6pm at weekends and on bank holidays.

Mathau o gamau gorfodi Gall RPA gymryd pedair lefel o gamau gweithredu: hysbysiadau diffyg, sef rhybuddion anffurfiol sy’n rhoi amser i chi ddatrys y broblem; byddwch yn cael rhybudd llafar ar yr un pryd ac weithiau lythyr hefyd hysbysiadau gorfodi, a gyhoeddir pan fydd yr arolygydd yn gweld nad yw’r broblem wedi’i datrys pan fydd yn ymweld eto; bydd yr hysbysiad yn datgan y drosedd y mae’r arolygydd o’r farn eich bod yn ei chyflawni ac yn dynodi’r mesurau y mae’n rhaid I chi eu rhoi ar waith o fewn cyfnod amser penodedig; bydd hefyd yn eich hysbysu o’ch hawl I apelio hysbysiadau cosb, a roddir os na fyddwch yn cydymffurfio â hysbysiad gorfodi; bydd hysbysiad cosb yn pennu dirwy ac yn rhoi 28 diwrnod I chi ei thalu erlyniad troseddol, os na fyddwch yn talu’r ddirwy a bennwyd yn yr hysbysiad cosb; gellir eich erlyn hefyd os byddwch yn methu â chydymffurfio â hysbysiad gorfodi Os bydd cyfran uchel o’r carcasau a archwiliwyd yn destun sylw, neu os ydych wedi cyflawni trosedd yn y gorffennol, gall RPA gyhoeddi hysbysiad gorfodi heb roi hysbysiad diffyg yn gyntaf. Felly hefyd mewn perthynas â throseddau difrifol sy’n ymwneud â methu â hysbysu, trwyddedau a chofnodion a marciau. Os ydych wedi cyflawni dwy drosedd neu fwy yn y gorffennol, gall RPA gyhoeddi hysbysiad cosb neu ddechrau erlyniad ar unwaith. Os bydd arolygydd yn dod o hyd i fwy nag un broblem yn ystod ymweliad, bydd RPA yn eu hystyried ar wahân at ddibenion gorfodi. Felly gallech dderbyn mwy nag un hysbysiad ar ôl arolygiad. Dirwyon Os bydd RPA yn eich erlyn, a chewch eich collfarnu o drosedd sy’n ymwneud â marcio neu labelu carcasau mewn ffordd sy’n debygol o gamarwain, nid oes terfyn i’r ddirwy y gall y llys ei phennu ar eich cyfer. Gall troseddau eraill arwain at ddirwyon posibl o hyd at £5,000. Sut i apelio Yr unig fath o gam gweithredu y gallwch apelio yn ei erbyn yw hysbysiad gorfodi. Mae dwy ffordd o wneud hyn: anfon e-bost neu ysgrifennu i’r tîm Cynlluniau Technegol Cig yn RPA cyn gynted â phosibl, gan amgáu unrhyw dystiolaeth nad oedd ar gael yn ystod yr archwiliad gwneud cwyn i’r llys ynadon, a all wneud gorchymyn yn diddymu’r hysbysiad Bydd gennych un mis o ddyddiad yr hysbysiad gorfodi i wneud cwyn i lys yr ynadon.

/guidance/comply-with-marketing-standards-for-fresh-fruit-and-vegetables,"If you import, pack, distribute or sell fruit or veg, you must follow quality and labelling rules and you may be inspected without notice. Comply with marketing standards for fresh fruit and vegetables Import, export and distribution of food Rural Payments Agency Anyone who markets fresh fruit or vegetables, salad crops, nuts or cultivated mushrooms must comply with regulations on quality and labelling. There are two sets of marketing standards: the Specific Marketing Standard (SMS), which applies to 10 types of fresh produce the General Marketing Standard (GMS), which applies to most other fresh fruit, vegetables, nuts and herbs The rules are detailed, and you should make sure you understand and follow the advice in [InlineAttachment:1] so that you comply with the law. The Horticultural Marketing Inspectorate (HMI) carries out unannounced inspections to ensure traders are complying with these rules and can prosecute you if you are not doing so. Who the standards apply to The marketing standards apply to all traders in these types of produce, including: importers packers (who may also be growers) distributors wholesalers retailers (who may not necessarily trade from shop premises) The Specific Marketing Standard The SMS applies to these 10 types of fresh produce: [InlineAttachment:3] [InlineAttachment:4] [InlineAttachment:5] [InlineAttachment:6] [InlineAttachment:7] [InlineAttachment:8] [InlineAttachment:9] [InlineAttachment:10] [InlineAttachment:11] [InlineAttachment:12] To be saleable, these types of produce must be: intact sound (for example, not rotten, severely bruised or severely damaged) clean fresh in appearance practically free from pests practically free from damage caused by pests affecting the flesh free of abnormal external moisture free of foreign smell or taste sufficiently developed/ripe, but not overdeveloped/overripe The produce must also be graded into one of these quality classes: Extra Class I Class II The produce must be labelled with: the name and address of the packer and/or dispatcher (or an official code mark which can be supplied by HMI) the nature of the produce if it’s not visible from outside quality class country of origin size When sold loose at retail, SMS produce must be labelled with its country of origin, quality class and any variety or type information required by the particular standard for the produce. Pre-packed produce Pre-packs of produce covered by the SMS must also show either net weight or the number of items of produce (unless this number can be clearly seen) You can find full information about labelling of pre-packs in the EU marketing standard, and a summary in HMI’s [InlineAttachment:1]. Produce for home processing Produce covered by the SMS that does not meet the requirements of the particular standard for that produce can be sold at retail for home processing. If you sell any produce covered by the SMS for home processing, you do not have to label it with a quality class, but it must be labelled as ‘produce for home processing’. The label can also carry further information eg ‘strawberries for home jam making’ or ‘apples for home pie making’. Produce sold for home processing still has to meet the quality criteria for the General Marketing Standard (see list in next section). The General Marketing Standard [InlineAttachment:13] applies to most other fresh fruit, vegetables, nuts, herbs and cultivated mushrooms, that are for retail sale rather than processing. The produce does not have to be graded into quality classes, but it must still be: intact sound (for example, not rotten, severely bruised or severely damaged) clean practically free from pests practically free from damage caused by pests affecting the flesh free of abnormal external moisture free of foreign smell or taste sufficiently developed/ripe, but not overdeveloped/overripe When sold loose at retail, the produce must be labelled with its country of origin. When sold pre-packed, it must be labelled with: country of origin the name and address of the packer and/or dispatcher (or an official code mark supplied by HMI) either net weight or number of items When the produce is sold boxed for wholesale, the box must be labelled with: country of origin the name and address of the packer and/or despatcher (or an official code mark supplied by HMI) UNECE standards Instead of the General Marketing Standard, the law allows you to use alternative standards adopted by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE). Produce not covered by the marketing standards These products have no specific quality or labelling requirements under the marketing standards: early and ware potatoes chilli peppers sweetcorn olives capers wild mushrooms manioc or cassava arrowroot salep Jerusalem artichokes sweet potatoes yams dasheen taro sago cocoyams yam beans and similar roots and tubers with high starch or inulin content coconuts brazil nuts cashew nuts bitter almonds pecans pistachios macadamia nuts, pine nuts, and all shelled nuts (that is, without their shells) bananas dates saffron ginger bay turmeric galangal chervil swede nutmeg onion sets Inkcap cep jelly nut lemon grass curry leaves liquorice roots sugar cane peanuts prepared and processed products, dried products, and products for industrial processing, wine making or animal feed This is not an exhaustive list. You should [InlineAttachment:2] if you’re not sure whether you need to be complying with the marketing standards for a particular product. Mixed types of produce You can sell packs of mixed produce up to 5kg, as long as: all of the produce is of uniform (ie the same) quality each type of produce complies with the marketing standard that applies to it You can label packs containing produce from more than one country with one of these wordings: ‘Mix of EU fresh horticultural produce’ ‘Mix of Non-EU fresh horticultural produce’ ‘Mix of EU and Non-EU fresh horticultural produce’ Retail distance selling Distance selling (also known as distance contracts) includes internet shopping, mail order, and purchases by telephone, fax or email. If you sell fresh produce by any of these methods, you must still give the customer the same information about the product as they would get in a retail outlet, before they buy. Inspections If you pack or trade in fresh fruit and vegetables in England and Wales, you may be inspected by the Horticultural Marketing Inspectorate (HMI). HMI chooses which businesses to inspect based on risk and previous inspection history (so if your business passes an inspection without problems, it’s less likely to be inspected in future). Inspections will be unannounced and you must follow any advice the inspector makes. What the inspector will be looking for The inspector will check whether you’re complying with EU marketing standards. Your fresh fruit and vegetables must: be of saleable quality have the appropriate quality grading (for produce covered by the SMS) be correctly labelled What happens if goods don’t pass inspection If your goods don’t pass inspection, the inspector will discuss your options for bringing the goods into conformity if possible or disposing of them if not. Your options may include: bringing the goods back into conformity eg by relabelling them or reclassifying them at a lower quality grading removing the goods from the fresh market, which may involve disposing of them by an approved method sending the goods back to the supplier eg to the packer or importer Before the inspector leaves, you will need to take a decision as to what you are going to do with the goods and sign an undertaking stating what action you will take. This undertaking is legally binding – if you break it you could be prosecuted. Before the inspector will allow you to put the goods back on sale, they may need to carry out a follow-up inspection. HMI are also more likely to select you for an unannounced inspection in future if your fresh fruit and vegetables have not passed inspection in the past. If your produce or labelling are repeatedly found to be defective, HMI may give you ‘amber’ status, meaning that they will carry out an increased number of inspections. If problems persist and HMI give you ‘red’ status, you may be prosecuted. Every visit HMI makes to your premises may include the collection of evidence which could in due course be used in any prosecution. Approved trader status If you are a grower/packer or an importer and your business consistently demonstrates a high level of conformity with the marketing standards, HMI can grant you approved trader status (ATS). This means that you are identified as low risk, and will be subject to fewer inspections. For more information about ATS, [InlineAttachment:2].

/government/news/milk-production-stays-within-uks-quota,"The Rural Payments Agency (RPA) has received end of year details from milk purchasers and direct sellers of the amount of milk which was produced for sale in 2013/14. Milk production stays within UK’s quota  Rural Payments Agency The RPA has confirmed that there will be no wholesale or direct sales levy for the 2013/14 quota year. The United Kingdom wholesale milk deliveries totalled 13.7 billion litres – 1.6 billion litres under the national wholesale quota. The UK’s direct sales amounted to 109.7 million litres – 33 million litres under the national direct sales quota. The wholesale delivery figures have been adjusted for butterfat content. The UK has not exceeded the national milk quota levels set by the European Union for 2013/14. The EU has the power to impose a levy but because UK producers have remained under the limit, there will be no wholesale or direct sales levy for the 2013/14 quota year. This data is based on end of year declarations and the provisional outcome is subject to amendment in the light of inspection of purchasers’ and producers’ annual returns. In addition, any business that buys raw or bulk milk direct from farmers has a duty to report the amount they buy on a monthly basis, so the industry can see how deliveries are running compared to the UK’s quota allocation during the year. These indicative figures are published on the GOV.UK website at the beginning of each month. ENDS Notes to Editors RPA is an executive agency of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). It is the single paying agency responsible for CAP schemes in England and for certain schemes, including Milk Quotas, throughout the UK. Supplementary levy is charged for milk sold in excess of quota, and contributes towards the cost of subsidised disposal methods such as intervention buying, export refunds or consumption aids. Had the UK as a whole been over quota, levy of approximately 24 pence per litre would have been payable on wholesale deliveries made in excess of quota. Direct sales levy would have been payable on the volume by which all direct sales in the quota year exceeded the national direct sales quota. As both quotas were not exceeded during 2013/14 the provisional calculations have resulted in neither a wholesale nor a direct sales levy being payable. At inspection, Direct Sellers or Purchasers who have under or overstated the level of their sales or receipts will be liable for a penalty. Additional financial penalties will apply to both wholesale purchasers and direct sellers who missed the deadline for return of their annual declarations of deliveries/sales. Additionally, direct sellers who did not return their declarations before 15 June were given 15 days in which to do so, or have their quota confiscated to the national reserve and purchasers who did not return their declarations before 15 June were also given 15 days in which to do so or their approval would be withdrawn. The Rural Payments Agency did not carry out temporary conversions of quota this year as the UK was well below national quota on both wholesales and direct sales. General enquiries on milk quota administration should be addressed to the Milk Quotas Team on 01392 315700 [Contact:1726]"

Bradford retailers fined for rotten fruit and vegetables  Rural Payments Agency The owners of a Bradford shop have been fined for selling rotten, damaged and incorrectly labelled fruit following an investigation by the Horticultural Marketing Inspectorate ( HMI ). Mohammad Haleem, age 36, and Mohammed Rahim, age 34, of Spencer Foods, in Spencer Road, admitted ten separate breaches of EU marketing standards for fresh horticultural produce when they appeared at Bradford Magistrates’ Court on Friday (14/11). The offences related to three separate displays of grapes, Golden Rose apples and apricots, which were affected by soiling, bruising and rot respectively, plus cherries, lychees, peaches, oranges, two varieties of onions and spinach which were displayed without the required country of origin. The grapes were also incorrectly labelled. The offences were found during at an HMI inspection visit to the shop on 5 February this year. Haleem and Rahim were each fined £1,200. They were also ordered to pay costs of £360 and a victims’ surcharge of £240. HMI is part of the Rural Payments Agency and Operations Director Paul Caldwell said: “This case highlights just part of the work RPA undertakes to protect consumers. “Fresh produce should be good quality and labelled accurately and the HMI work is very important in ensuring these standards are met. “Prosecution is a last resort and we always try to gain compliance with quality and labelling regulations through advice guidance and instruction. “In this particular case the prosecution followed a series of visits over 16 months. Between August 2012 and November 2013, the store failed ten successive visits from inspectors where advice and guidance was offered, but inspections found persistent poor quality and inadequate labelling.” Background Spencer Foods is located at 2 Spencer Road, Bradford.

Dress carcases You must dress pig carcases according to either the EU or the UK dressing specification. You can’t use your own dressing specification. The EU specification Before weighing the carcase, you must remove the: tongue bristles (hair) hooves genital organs flare fat kidney diaphragm The UK specification In the UK, abattoirs are allowed to present pig carcases according to the ‘UK specification’. Carcases are dressed as for the EU specification, except that: the following parts are left in: kidneys flare fat diaphragm the tongue may be left in or taken out Weigh carcases You must record carcase weights as they appear on the actual scale display. You must not round the weight up or down. The dressed carcase must be weighed for its warm weight. Wherever possible, this must be done not more than 45 minutes after the pig has been stuck. The following table shows the other factors that affect the warm weight that you record for the carcase and the reductions you should apply (also called coefficients). Carcase presentation Adjustment to weight recorded (coefficient) Weighed with the kidneys, flare fat and diaphragm in Carcases up to 56kg reduce by 0.7kg; Carcases between 56.5kg and 74.5kg reduce by 1.1kg; Carcases of 74.6kg and over reduce by 1.6kg Weighed with tongue in Reduce by 0.3kg Weighed more than 45 minutes after the pig has been stuck Reduce by 0.1% for each additional 15 minutes that passes or part thereof To calculate the cold weight, deduct 2% from the warm weight. Grade carcases At the time of weighing, abattoirs registered with the Pig Carcase Grading Scheme must also assess and grade the lean meat content of the carcase. These are approved instruments to use for measuring back fat: Intra-scope (Optical Probe) Fat-O-Meater (FOM) Hennessy Grading Probe (HGP II) CSB Ultra-Meater AutoFom (fully automatic ultrasonic carcase grading) The results must then be used to grade the carcase according to this scale: Lean meat as a percentage of recorded carcase cold weight Grade 60 or more S 55 or more but less than 60 E 50 or more but less than 55 U 45 or more but less than 50 R 40 or more but less than 45 O less than 40 P Record carcase grades Information about the carcase grade must be either marked directly on to the carcase or recorded at the time of grading.

Sadin Kilic, owner of Bin Diyar Ltd which trades under the name ‘Hilal Supermarket’ in Edmonton, North London, was sentenced at Tottenham Magistrates Court on 25 June 2015. The HMI investigation found 9 regulated displays breaking the EU marketing rules. Of these, 3 failed to meet the lowest marketable quality permitted for both specific and general marketing standards (including rots in aubergines, pears and limes). 8 displays also failed to meet the statutory labelling requirements Rural Payments Agency Operations Director Paul Caldwell said: This case is another example of the work the Horticultural Marketing Inspectorate undertakes to protect consumers. Prosecution is only used as a last resort and we will always try to gain statutory compliance with the marketing standard regulations through advice, guidance and instruction. In this particular case, the prosecution followed a series of risk-based inspection visits to the shop over nearly 2 and a half years. Between August 2012 and November 2014, the store received 16 visits from inspectors where advice and guidance on compliance was offered. During this time Mr Kilic consistently failed to meet his statutory responsibility and failed to ensure that the quality and labelling of the fresh produce placed on offer for sale met the required minimum standards permitted. Mr Kilic pleaded guilty to 8 of the 9 charges. The charge relating to the limes was dropped as Mr Kilic claimed they were not on offer for sale. He was fined £900 for the offences, £500 for the prosecution’s costs and a £20 victim surcharge. In sentencing, the magistrates observed that this was something that had been going for many years, with multiple warnings that Mr Kilic had failed to rectify.

/guidance/importing-common-agricultural-policy-goods,"How to import food and agriculture products covered by CAP from outside the EU: import licences, duty, import quotas and relief from CAP charges. Importing Common Agricultural Policy goods International freight industry and businesses making customs declarations Rural Payments Agency HM Revenue & Customs Introduction The Common Agricultural Policy ( CAP ) exists to increase agricultural productivity within the EU , provide a fair standard of living for the farming community, stabilise markets and guarantee security of supplies. It also assures reasonable prices for consumers by controlling the market in agricultural and related products within the EU . CAP places specific import controls and duties on food, agricultural and horticultural products and their derivatives. This guide explains how to import products covered by CAP from outside the EU , tells you what levies, refunds, suspensions and quotas are applied and explains how to take advantage of import schemes that can help you reduce the duties payable on your goods. You must be registered with the Rural Payments Agency ( RPA ), which manages the CAP schemes if you want to import or export licensable goods or claim refunds. Common Agricultural Policy import licences Imports of food and agriculture products covered by CAP ( CAP goods) from outside the EU are often subject to customs duty and may require a licence that will need to be presented. For some goods, a tariff quota can be applied for. Tariff quotas allow imports to be made at a reduced rate of duty and are subject to presentation of an appropriate import licence. What are CAP goods? CAP covers food, agricultural and horticultural products and their derivatives. You can find the full list of goods covered by CAP in Notice 780 . The RPA operates a number of CAP trade schemes for specific products some of which may reduce the duty you pay. You can find guidance to the RPA ’s CAP schemes in leaflet ET1. Goods requiring an import licence Certain CAP goods require an import licence to: provide information for management of the EU agricultural market sectors impose limits on the quantities of goods imported allow a reduced rate of duty in some circumstances Find details of products which require an import or export CAP licence . Most licences are held electronically on the Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight ( CHIEF ) system, and for these you do not need to present a paper licence at the point of import unless the goods enter the EU in a country other than the UK. A licence will stipulate what the goods are, the quantity of those goods that you are permitted to import, and the time within which you must import them. You’ll need to keep track of how much of the licensed quantity you have imported if you want to import the goods in more than one shipment. A check on current usage can be made through CHIEF using code DLLU and then inserting the licence number. Goods not requiring an import licence For some commodities a licence is never needed. There are also occasions when other commodities don’t require a licence when normally they would. Examples are as follows: goods already in free circulation in the EU goods entering the customs warehousing regime - see the guide on customs warehousing goods that aren’t entered into free circulation, eg, goods eligible for Inward Processing - see the guide on Inward Processing for most imports where the security amounts to less than €5 goods being returned to the EU , read Notice 236 returned goods relief. Securities When importing CAP goods you may need to deposit a security sum with HMRC , or lodge a security with the RPA at the time of applying for a licence. Applying for a CAP import licence Before you can apply for a CAP import licence, you must register as a customer (trader) with the RPA . Find out about customer registration . **You can apply for an import licence by email. However, before you can do this, you need to be approved and to accept the terms and conditions of use set out by the RPA . You can find guidance to the RPA ’s CAP schemes in leaflet ET1 on the RPA website. You will find terms and conditions for the submission of licences by email in section S page 8 of this document. You’ll need to provide the following information: your full name and address, including member state trader registration number the exporting country the country of origin the standard trade denomination for the product being imported - together with the combined nomenclature code and description the quantity of the product you wish to import any special particulars and notes Once registered and approved you’ll need to submit your licence requests by email. You can find the import licence application . CAP charges To prevent low-priced imports competing against high-priced EU goods, a range of different types of CAP charges are applied to products imported from outside the EU . These charges are known as duty and are due at the time of import. Duties payable There are several types of duty payable on imported CAP goods: specific customs duty is applied to most agricultural goods from outside the EU and is based on weight ad valorem customs duty is a percentage of the value of a consignment countervailing charge may apply to certain products at certain times of year - or in certain market conditions the safeguard charge applies when the value of a consignment is less than a trigger price - and may be imposed at short notice Processed goods may give you the option of paying different rates of specific and ad valorem customs duties, in which case you can opt for the formula that results in the lower rate of duty. Preferential rates may apply to goods originating in certain countries or groups of countries. For more information about how you can use preferences, read the guide on  using trade preferences . Small consignments Small consignments of CAP goods sent to a private individual may be eligible for a flat charge of 3.5% ad valorem duty if such imports fulfil all of the following criteria: only occasional for personal or family use of a non-commercial nature of less than £282 in total value The goods may still be liable for VAT and/or excise duty. Advertising material, business gifts and articles purchased abroad by a UK resident aren’t eligible for the flat rate charge. Relief from CAP charges Certain goods may get relief from CAP charges: Goods eligible for a reduced or nil rate of duty under Tariff quota arrangements. Read Notice 375 tariff quotas .  Goods eligible for a favourable rate of charge by reason of their end-use, see the guide on end-use relief . Goods exported from the EU and then imported. Read Notice 236 returned goods relief. Temporarily imported goods. Read Notice 200 temporary admission . Import procedures for CAP goods Before you can import CAP goods into the UK: you should register as a trader with the RPA you can apply for approval to submit electronic applications for CAP import licences For each import, you must: check whether the goods require a CAP licence check any specific procedures for the goods apply for an import licence deposit the required security with HMRC or the RPA import some or all of the goods declare the import, either electronically via the CHIEF system, or on form C88, the Single Administrative Document ( SAD ) record how much was imported against the licence once goods are declared for free circulation (attributions), and show the remaining balance submit the licence to customs if you have a paper licence make further imports to use up any quantity remaining on your licence within the time limit specified If your import licence is approved, it will be issued, usually electronically, within five working days of receipt of your application. For paper licences, Customs will endorse the attributions on your licence and return the documents as soon as all import procedures have been completed. When you complete the SAD you must put the following in box 44, which describes additional documents accompanying your customs declaration: the identifier of your CAP import licence the expiry date of your licence the country prefix the number shown in box 25 of your licence the date of issue of your licence You don’t need a security deposit when you apply for your licence if the amount comes to less than €100, and in some circumstances, less than €500.

Imports of CAP goods by post Procedures for CAP goods imported by post are covered in volume 3 part 3 of the Tariff. For consignments exceeding £2,000 in value you must complete a formal declaration on SAD , which will be sent to you from the Postal Depot. CAP rules on livestock, meat and animal products Imports of animals and products of animal origin are controlled by licensing. While you can import those animals and products of animal origin that meet the conditions of a general licence, you will have to apply for a specific licence in other cases.

/guidance/the-beef-carcase-classification-scheme-classify-carcases,"Beef abattoirs must dress, categorise, classify, weigh and label carcases according to regulations, and communicate results to suppliers. The Beef Carcase Classification scheme: classify carcases Meat production Rural Payments Agency You must dress, categorise, classify and weigh beef carcases within 1 hour of slaughter. Only a qualified licensed classifier can classify carcases. The classifier does not have to be from your own company. Automated grading techniques can be used, but you must first obtain a licence from the Rural Payments Agency - see [InlineAttachment:2]. If these fail to classify a carcase, it must still be classified on the day of slaughter. Dress the carcase For more details and images of how the carcase must be dressed, download [InlineAttachment:3]. You must dress carcases in line with one of these specifications: Standard Specification EC Reference Specification UK Specification You must not operate a ‘company’ dressing specification. The table below explains which areas of the carcase must be trimmed for each specification.   cod/udder fat crown fat bed fat brisket fat thin skirt Standard Specification on on on on on EC Reference Specification off off on on off UK Specification off off off off off Categorise the carcase You must identify each carcase as falling into one of the categories in the table below. Category Description A Carcase of uncastrated male animal aged from 12 months to less than 24 months B Carcase of uncastrated male animal aged from 24 months C Carcase of uncastrated male animal aged from 12 months D Carcase of female animal that has calved E Carcase of other male animal aged from 12 months Z Carcase of animal (male or female) aged from 8 months to less than 12 months Classify the carcase To conform with the Beef Carcase Classification scheme, abattoirs must grade carcases according to their: conformation (flesh coverage and overall shape) fat coverage weight The Beef Carcase Classification scheme sets out an EU-wide ‘Union scale’ for these gradings. For more detail on the Union scale download [InlineAttachment:1]. Conformation The Union scale has 6 conformation classes for bovines aged 8 months and over. The classifier makes a visual assessment of the overall shape and flesh coverage of the carcase. Conformation class Carcase quality Subdivision (where applicable) S superior   E excellent   U very good upper (+) or lower (-) R good   O fair upper (+) or lower (-) P poor upper (+) or lower (-) Fat coverage The Union scale has 5 classes for fat cover. The classifier makes a visual assessment of the carcase’s external fat development. Fat class Fat cover Subdivision (where applicable) 1 low   2 slight   3 average   4 high leaner (L) or fatter (H) 5 very high leaner (L) or fatter (H) The 15-point scale Instead of using the standard subdivisions, which only apply to certain conformation and fat classes (eg U+ for conformation or 4L for fat) abattoirs can choose to adopt a more detailed system of subdivisions, called the 15-point scale. Under the 15-point scale, each of the fat and conformation classes is subdivided into: low (marked as ‘-‘) medium (marked as ‘mid’) high (marked as ‘+’) This greater number of subdivisions allows carcases to be graded more accurately. Weight The carcase must be weighed within 1 hour of slaughter. You must record the weight shown on the scale display and must not round up or down. To calculate the cold weight, deduct 2% from the warm weight. Stamp or label the carcase Under the BCC scheme, you must either stamp or label each carcase (this is in addition to the requirements of the Beef Labelling Scheme ). If you use automated grading techniques, you must use labels. You must put marks and labels in specific places: on the hindquarters, the label goes on the striploin at the level of the fourth lumbar vertebra on the forequarters the label goes on the brisket between 10 and 30 cm from the edge of the sternum Marks and labels must not be removed before the quarters are boned. How to use stamps You must use indelible, non-toxic ink and the letters and numbers must be at least 2 centimetres high. The stamp must show the carcase’s: category conformation class fat cover How to use labels The labels must be at least 50cm2. The information must be legible. Any decision to change a classification label can only be made by the person who originally classified the carcase. This person must make any such change themselves by clearly marking the label. The label must show: the category the conformation class the fat cover the approval number of the abattoir the identification or slaughter number of the animal the date of slaughter the weight of the carcase where applicable, that the classification has been carried out by using automated grading techniques Labels must be: tamper-proof tear-resistant firmly attached to each quarter of the carcase Communicate the classification results You must tell whoever has sent the animal to slaughter the results of the classification, either in writing or electronically. The format you use could be an invoice or attached document. You must tell them: the classification results (including the subclasses from the 15-point scale if you used them) the category the carcase’s weight (specifying whether this is the warm weight or the cold weight) which dressing specification you used If the classification was done using automatic grading techniques, you must tell them this too. You should also tell them: the kill number the date of slaughter If you can’t tell the person who supplied the animal, you should tell the person or the company responsible for the slaughter operations."

How to claim a school milk subsidy School milk scheme Rural Payments Agency Once you have registered as a school milk claimant with the Rural Payments Agency ( RPA ), you can claim your subsidy. How to claim You can make your claim using [InlineAttachment:1]. It’s your responsibility as a claimant to make sure your claim is accurate. When to claim Claims must be made in arrears but claim periods can’t be before the date of your approval as a claimant. Claim periods can be: school terms school terms rounded to whole months the same periods as claims for milk under the nursery milk scheme calendar months any other period of between 1 and 7 months RPA will contact you annually to find out your claim periods. You must provide this information before you submit your claims or they can’t be processed. You must send your claim to RPA by the end of the third month after the end of the claim period. For example: Claim period ends in Deadline for receipt March 30 June April 31 July July 31 October December 31 March If the deadline falls on a public holiday or weekend, it’s extended to the next working day. Late claims may be subject to a financial penalty, as detailed in Commission Regulation 657/2008 (as amended), Article 11(3). Claim for multiple schools If you’re claiming school milk for more than 1 school, you’ll need to attach an annex to each claim with information about all the schools. You can use the [InlineAttachment:2] to provide this. If you use your own spreadsheet, you’ll need to replicate the columns and headings on RPA school milk claims spreadsheet. If you’re claiming for primary and secondary schools, you’ll need to submit 2 annexes: one for pupils receiving primary education one for pupils receiving secondary education Where a school has both primary and secondary pupils, you must only include the number of eligible pupils in each category on each annex. Pupils receiving primary education in special or secondary schools can be included in your annex for primary schools, so they can benefit from top up funding. When to expect your payment If this is your first claim, you won’t be paid until RPA has carried out an inspection to check your records. Further pre-payment inspections may be required on subsequent claims if errors are found. RPA aims to pay all other claims as quickly as possible, with at least 96% paid within 28 days and 100% paid within 90 days of its receipt. If your claim is incomplete or we have to query any of the information on it, this period starts from the date on which the query is resolved. Claim administrative costs in Wales For children in Key Stage 1 education in Wales, the full cost of milk is reimbursed, plus a contribution to administration costs. Examples of the costs you can claim for include: school and local authority staff time spent distributing milk dealing with suppliers compiling claims paying supplier invoices maintaining records to support claims management checking of claims supervising pupils while they consume milk stocking milk removing refuse cleaning refrigerators refrigeration costs purchase leasing maintenance running costs (including electricity) administrative costs stationery postage telephone printing cleaning materials, like washing up liquid beakers, cups and straws refuse disposal costs containers waste collections storage of invoices and other records for the required 3 year minimum transfer of records to microfiche or electronic formats Templates to help you work out your overheads are available by calling RPA on 01392 315766. You don’t have to claim overheads and if you don’t claim when you first apply, you can still do so on future applications. As it may take several claims to recoup the full cost (for example, of refrigerators), there is no limit to the number of claims over which the cost is spread, but you should not include the full cost on each claim. You’ll need to be able to show that the cost is equivalent to more than 3 pence per carton.

The PO will be expected to prove conclusively that it was formed on the initiative of the growers. Applying for PO recognition In England and Wales, POs are assessed and managed by the Rural Payments Agency ( RPA ). In Northern Ireland and Scotland, the Devolved Administration ( DA ) manages the process of PO recognition. To seek recognition, you will need to complete [InlineAttachment:2]. You can contact the RPA ’s Customer Service Centre on: 03000 200 301 to ask for this application form. Guidance on applications No strict rules govern PO assessment, and either RPA or the relevant DA makes the ultimate decision on PO recognition. However, a PO must show it is responsible for all of its products in terms of: collecting storing packaging marketing POs must either provide actual facilities/services or be ultimately responsible for arranging their provision to all of its members, including future members. You should contact the RPA or your relevant DA for further advice on applying for PO recognition. You will also find detailed advice on PO recognition in the [InlineAttachment:1]. Criteria for becoming a PO The PO recognition assessment will check/reference the criteria set out in the [National Strategy and its Environmental Framework] [InlineAttachment:2] . Overall, POs must be able to withstand close scrutiny of their operation and management and clearly demonstrate that: scheme expenditure/investments benefit all members on a fair basis it has clear voting arrangements and evidence of democratic decision-making its members benefit from the PO ’s funds and capital investments and that benefit is not directly proportionate to the members’ contribution to the fund if a number of closely related businesses have between them a shareholding dominance, evidence shows this does not constitute undue influence on PO activities Application inspection visits On receipt of an application for recognition, inspectors will visit the PO to check that the PO is carrying out the required activities such as: collecting operating fund contributions in the correct manner maintaining satisfactory records not receiving duplicate funding, directly or indirectly collecting enough contributions to cover the PO ’s proportion of the previous years’ expenditure Access must be given to inspection officers at all reasonable times. If a PO prevents an inspector from making a check, the application will be rejected.

Application deadline Applications and supporting information needs to be submitted by 15 September (to commence on 1 January of the following year). Full guidance on the application process is covered in [InlineAttachment:1]. Who can join a PO ?

Members must discuss this with their POs and the PO must tell the RPA or relevant DA if its members belong to more than one PO . When can you join a PO ? You may join a PO at any point during the year. However your marketed production (produce available for sale) won’t count towards the PO ’s marketed production until the following year.

/government/news/yorkshire-fresh-produce-retailer-fined-after-failing-to-meet-marketing-standards,"Fresh produce retailer fined following HMI investigation Yorkshire fresh produce retailer fined after failing to meet marketing standards  Rural Payments Agency A Leeds based retailer has been ordered to pay almost £3,400 for displaying, offering for sale and selling rotten fruit and vegetables that failed to meet minimum quality standards. Mohammad Ozair Siddique, Director of Leeds City Stores Ltd. appeared at Leeds Magistrates Court on 28 October 2016, following a seven month long investigation by the Rural Payments Agency’s ( RPA ) Horticultural Marketing Inspectors ( HMI ). A final HMI inspection conducted on 12 May 2016, found displays in breach of the EU marketing rules for fresh produce quality and labelling, including rotten loquats and peaches. In court Mr Siddique pleaded guilty to the charges on behalf of the company and was fined £1,000, £2,293 costs and a £100 victim surcharge. Paul Caldwell, RPA Operations Director said: Concerted efforts were made by HMI to work closely with the business through face-to-face meetings, verbal warnings and formal written notices, all aimed at achieving improved compliance from the business. Unfortunately such advice is not always heeded and when all other options have been exhausted we will resort to the use of criminal sanction to bring about a required change in behaviour. Background Leeds City Stores Ltd. is based at 63 Shepherds Lane, Leeds, LS8 5AT. Horticultural Marketing Inspectors are part of the Rural Payments Agency ( RPA ). The inspectors are responsible for the enforcement of the EU marketing standards for fresh fruit, vegetables, salad crops, nuts and cultivated mushroom, throughout England and Wales, wherever fresh produce is grown, imported, exported, bought or sold."
/guidance/calculate-your-school-milk-subsidy,"Find out how much milk or yoghurt you can claim for under the scheme and how to price subsidised milk in a school. Calculate your school milk subsidy School milk scheme Rural Payments Agency Calculate your maximum entitlement Eligible pupils may receive up to 250ml of subsidised milk products each school day. To work out the maximum entitlement, you should use this calculation: Calculate your maximum entitlement       The number of school days when curricular education takes place Multiplied by the number of children on the school roll Multiplied again by 0.00025 (this represents the maximum daily allowance of 250ml expressed in kilolitres) Round to 3 decimal places You can simplify the number of children on the school roll by using the number of pupils established in the most recent schools’ census, taking no account of absences. You must only claim for quantities that were actually distributed to eligible schoolchildren during the claim period, and you mustn’t exceed the maximum entitlement for that claim period. You must make sure that you do not claim in excess of the maximum entitlement for any school, even if your total claim is within the overall maximum entitlement. Subsidy rates The EU aid rate is €186.945 per kilolitre for milk and yoghurt. These rates are converted to sterling using the exchange rate applicable on the first day of the month when the claim period starts. The EU aid rate is topped up nationally for pupils in primary education and children over 11 receiving primary education in special schools. This top up rate is £39.855 per kilolitre. Monthly subsidy rates Every month, RPA publishes the subsidy rates which you can use to calculate the amount of subsidy you could receive: [InlineAttachment:1] For children in Key Stage 1 education in Wales, the full cost of milk is reimbursed, plus a contribution to administration costs. For children under 5 who are regularly attending a nursery or other pre-school establishment, the full cost of up to 189ml of milk per pupil can be claimed under the Nursery Milk Scheme. Milk fully paid for under the Nursery Milk Scheme isn’t eligible for the EU subsidy. Which pupils can be charged Schools must only use the subsidy provided to reduce the cost of the product for pupils. A subsidy is considered to have been passed on to pupils when milk products are provided free of charge. If products are included in school fees, you must ensure that the amount of aid is reflected in the fees charged to the pupils who are benefiting from the subsidy. Where an extra fee is charged for food or snacks on top of the fees, you should be able to clearly demonstrate that the saving is being passed on. If a price is paid directly by the pupils, or the products are included as part of a set-price meal, you must ensure that the amount of aid is reflected in the prices charged. Reductions made as a result of the subsidy should be clearly shown on school fee bills or receipts or mentioned in school literature. In all these cases, you must have evidence that demonstrates how selling prices are worked out. All the prices charged must also comply with the maximum price rules. Maximum price rules You must ensure that no more than 7pence per serving is charged above the cost of the milk product, once the subsidy has been taken into account. Calculate the maximum selling price       Purchase price paid to the supplier including any discounts but excluding any delivery charges Minus subsidy Plus up to 7pence per serving administration and distribution charge to cover the costs of operating the scheme Equals price charged to pupil The selling price calculation can be applied to a term or a whole school year. There may be occasions where you opt for a whole school year calculation and find later that your calculations weren’t correct; for example, because there was a change in purchase price of the milk. In these instances, you can return to making the calculation on a termly basis and adjust it the following term to recover any loss or profit you’ve made previously. You’ll need to convert your claim into kilolitres. Products won’t be eligible for the subsidy if the maximum selling price is exceeded or of the administration and distribution charges can’t be justified. Administration and distribution charges You must be able to: justify any administration and distribution charges made to the pupil show that these charges do not exceed the markup on similar products Some costs may be incurred centrally by a claimant or local authority. Others may be paid for by a maintained school’s delegated budget. In these cases, you’ll need to agree locally how the charge proceeds will be shared and be able to show this in your records. The purchase price for calculations The purchase price you use to calculate your selling price mustn’t include any overheads, delivery charges or other incidentals. If supplies are bought at different prices over the period you’re claiming for, you can use an average price in your calculation. Just divide the total cost of the supply by the total volume.
