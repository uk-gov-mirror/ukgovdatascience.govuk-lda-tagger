/guidance/salmonella-get-your-egg-laying-hens-tested,"How to take samples for testing, when you don't have to get a flock tested and what happens if one of your flocks tests positive. Salmonella: get your egg-laying hens tested  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Animal and Plant Health Agency The Scottish Government Closed organisation: Department of Agriculture and Rural Development You must take samples, eg faeces, from each of your flocks and send them to a laboratory for testing if you produce eggs on a commercial basis. This is part of the national control programme ( NCP ) for salmonella, which aims to control salmonella in poultry flocks across the EU. A flock is a group of birds that shares the same air space, eg a chicken house or range area. If you’re not sure if your birds are considered to be in one or more flock, you can ask for advice from the Animal and Plant Health Agency ( APHA ) in England, Scotland or Wales, or the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development ( DARD ) in Northern Ireland. You’ll be prosecuted or fined if you don’t get your egg-laying hens tested as described in this guide. A fine can range from £100 to £4,500. When you don’t have to test a flock You don’t have to test a flock if you either: only produce eggs for private use (not for sale) have fewer than 350 hens and only sell eggs directly to consumers through farm gate sales, or supply local shops (eg village shops) that only sell to consumers Register your flocks before you get them tested You must register each premises where you keep your flocks on one of the following: the Great Britain Poultry Register if you’re in England, Scotland or Wales the Northern Ireland Poultry Register if you farm in Northern Ireland When you must not sample Avoid taking samples from chicks, pullets or hens during or shortly after giving antibiotics that affect salmonella. APHA or DARD could declare your flock positive for salmonella if: inspectors see from the flock medicine book that you have given antibiotics the laboratory tests find antibiotics in samples taken by inspectors Get advice from your vet about antibiotics You should speak to the vet who prescribed the antibiotics in one of the following, depending on where you farm: APHA if you farm in England, Scotland or Wales DARD if you farm in Northern Ireland - you can ask them when to test after giving antibiotics Paying for samples and tests You’ll have to pay for both of the following regular operator samples and tests, as well as the routine official control samples. Find out what you’ll have to pay for tests and samples . Take samples from your flock You’ll have to take different kinds of samples in different ways depending on your situation. Take samples from chicks When chicks are delivered to you, you must send the following for laboratory testing: one hatchery tray liner or one delivery box liner for every 500 chicks, up to 10 for each delivery any chicks that are dead when they arrive from the hatchery, up to 60 carcasses Take samples from pullets You must take samples from pullets (young hens, also called rearing hens) 2 weeks before you place them in the layer unit or house. Take samples from adult egg-laying hens You must take samples from adult egg-laying hens in the layer unit or house: when they’re between 22 and 26 weeks old every 15 weeks after that How to take samples from barn or free-range flocks You must use boot swabs (fabric overshoes) to collect samples from barn or free-range hens. You can buy sampling equipment from the government-approved laboratory you plan to send samples to, or from your vet. You can also ask your nearest APHA office or DARD for advice on where to buy sampling equipment. You should use: disposable plastic overboots 2 pairs of boot swabs tap water or bottled still water for moistening boot swabs - never use sparkling water or water treated on the farm with antibacterial agents or acids disposable plastic gloves sealable bags or sample pots packaging for sending your sample bags or pots to the laboratory Prepare to take samples Take samples in the existing bedding - don’t put new bedding down. Gather all the equipment you’ll need before you go into the laying house, to prevent contamination before, during and after sampling. You should take special care to avoid contamination if you keep other animals (especially pigs or cattle) on your premises. To prevent disinfectant or sanitiser affecting your sample, you: shouldn’t use hand sanitiser on your plastic gloves should put on your plastic overboots after you’ve walked through disinfectant If you do wear plastic overboots when you walk through disinfectant, you should put on a another pair afterwards to protect the boot swabs from the disinfectant. Take samples from the flock house You should sample only the inside of the house, even if you’re sampling free-range birds that spend part of the day outside. Also, avoid sampling the areas just inside doors and pop holes, as they may have been contaminated by material from outdoors. Take 2 pairs of boot swabs from each flock. Moisten the boot swabs with water before you take samples - the water you use must be sterile and not contain any antibiotics (antimicrobials) or sanitisers. Divide the house into 2 equal parts for sampling, and use one pair of boot swabs in each part. Take at least 100 steps with each pair of boot swabs, walking round the entire house. Drag your feet on the floor to pick up as much material as possible. If the house is divided into several pens, spend more time in the larger pens and less in the smaller pens. When you’ve finished sampling, take the boot swabs off and turn them inside out carefully so that the material you’ve collected stays on them. Put the boot swabs in a sample pot or sealable bag to send to the laboratory. How to take samples from caged birds You must collect faeces samples from caged birds. You should gather all the equipment you’re going to need before you go into the laying house, to prevent contamination before, during and after sampling. Run the droppings from end of belts, scrapers or pit on the day of sampling so that you collect fresh material You can buy sampling equipment from the government-approved laboratory you plan to send samples to, or from your vet. You can also ask your nearest APHA office or DARD for advice on where to buy sampling equipment. You should use: 3 large fabric swabs for cage houses with belts (that catch the droppings) that don’t have scrapers (for scraping faeces off) disposable plastic gloves sealable bags or sample pots for faeces packaging for sending your sample bags or pots to the laboratory Prepare to take samples You should gather all the equipment you’re going to need before you go into the laying house, to prevent contamination before, during and after sampling. Run the droppings belts or scrapers on the day of sampling so that you collect fresh material. Take samples from belts or scrapers You should collect pooled faeces from places such as the scrapers at the discharge ends of each of the droppings belts. Use any of the following: your gloved hands inverted bags spatulas Collect faeces from the belts or scrapers on every row and tier of the cages so the samples are representative. If there isn’t a scraper on the end of the belt that gathers faeces, use a large fabric swab and rub this over the discharge ends of the belts after you’ve run them to collect fresh faeces. This exposes new areas of belting at the discharge end so that you can take more representative faeces samples. You must collect one sample from pullets and 2 samples from adult birds. Each sample must weigh 150g. Place the samples in a pot or sealable bag to send to the laboratory. If each sample weighs less than 150g, the laboratory won’t carry out the testing and you’ll have to send more samples. Label samples On each label you must include: the date you took the sample your registration number or your County Parish Holding (CPH) number or DARD flock number the identification of the flock - house name or number and the month and year you moved the flock into that house for multi age flocks, use the date when you moved the oldest birds the name and address of the flock’s holding the age of the birds in the flock the number of birds in the flock the contact details of the person sending the sample In Northern Ireland there may be different requirements please contact your local DARD office . Send samples to a laboratory You should send your samples on the day you collect them. Refrigerate your samples at 4°C if you can’t send your samples on that same day. Make sure the testing laboratory receives your samples within 4 days of when you collected them, otherwise you’ll have to take new samples. You must send your salmonella NCP samples to a UK approved laboratory. Find laboratories approved by: DARD in Northern Ireland the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs ( Defra ) in England and Wales the Scottish government The laboratory usually sends the results to the person who sent the sample and the person the sampled flock is registered to. If the sample tests positive for salmonella, the laboratory will also send the results to Defra . Official sampling at your premises In Northern Ireland, officials from DARD take samples. In England, Scotland and Wales, an APHA official, authorised vet or Industry Classification Benchmark (ICB) auditor (if your flock is in the Lion Code scheme) take samples. They will take samples once a year if you keep more than 1,000 birds on your premises. Officials from APHA or DARD may also take samples in other situations: one of your flocks gets a positive result for salmonella they’re investigating a food-borne outbreak that might be linked to a specific poultry farm and suspect a salmonella infection on your holding You won’t have to pay for an official control sample in these cases. What happens if you get a positive test result From a laying flock Both of the following will happen if a sample from any of your laying flocks tests positive for Salmonella Enteritidis or Salmonella Typhimurium (including monophasic Salmonella Typhimurium) that isn’t a result of vaccination: APHA officials will visit your holding and take an official sample to confirm the positive result you’ll have to keep the eggs on your premises while you’re waiting for the test result You won’t be allowed sell your eggs as Class A if the official sample confirms the positive result or you run out of storage space while waiting for the result. You’ll have to do one of the following instead: dispose of them as a category 3 animal by-product sell them as Class B eggs You must mark eggs in one of the following 2 ways if you have to sell them as Class B: with the official Class B mark (a circle with the letter B inside) use a spray or food dye to leave a coloured mark Egg marketing inspectors will visit your premises to check you’re complying with the restrictions. Extra samples When APHA officials visit to take the samples, they may take 5 bird carcasses and store the organs. If the samples give a negative result, APHA officials may have the stored organs tested for residues of antibiotics. If any residues are found, the test result may be treated as positive for salmonella. APHA officials will also take official control samples from every other flock on your premises. They will visit again when a new flock is placed in a house in which the last flock had a positive test result. They will take this official control sample when the birds are between 22 and 26 weeks old. You won’t have to pay for official control samples taken in response to a positive result. A government vet will also visit your holding to give advice on salmonella control. In Northern Ireland contact DARD or your private vet for advice. From a rearing flock If a sample from your rearing flock tests positive for Salmonella Enteritidis or Salmonella Typhimurium (including monophasic Salmonella Typhimurium), officials may visit your farm to confirm the result and offer advice. Get advice on controlling infections for other types of salmonella Get advice on how to control the infection from one of the following if your flock tests positive for other types of salmonella: your vet your nearest APHA office if you live in England, Scotland or Wales DARD if you live in Northern Ireland If your samples test positive for salmonella You can ask for more tests, at your own cost if you think a positive test result is false. You must contact either of the following to get these tests or more information about retesting: your nearest APHA office DARD APHA or DARD will arrange for an officer to supervise the collection of any one of the following samples for testing: 300 hen carcasses 4,000 eggs 2 dust samples and 5 boot swab samples from barn and free-range birds 2 dust samples and 5 pooled faeces samples from caged birds You can only get restrictions lifted and sell eggs from the flock as Class A eggs if the samples test negative. Keep records You must keep all your records for at least 2 years. APHA or DARD officials may check them at any time, eg during a routine NCP visit or after a positive test result. In Northern Ireland there may be different requirements please contact your local DARD office . Keep test records You must record all of the following each time you take samples: date and time you took the sample identification of the flock sampled - the house name or number and the month and year the flock moved into the house type of sample, eg boot swab or pooled faeces age of the flock sampled - there may be more than one age if the sample is from a multi-age house laboratory that tested the sample test result In Northern Ireland there may be different requirements please contact your local DARD office . Keep movement records You need to record any movement of birds to or from your holding. For each movement record the: date of movement number of birds age of the birds identification of the flock if you’re moving an entire flock - but only if you keep more than one flock on your holding identity of the building or group of buildings into or from which you’re moving the birds address that the birds moved from (including the building name or number) address that the birds moved to (including the building name or number) Food chain information documents You must declare the flock’s most recent salmonella test result in the food chain information ( FCI ) documents that you send with the birds to slaughter if you market any meat from your birds as fresh meat. You don’t have to declare the most recent salmonella test if you heat treat all the meat from the flock before marketing it for human consumption. Declare salmonella test results You must declare all the NCP Salmonella test results, negative or positive, as well as the date the sample was taken from the flock in the Food Chain Information ( FCI ) documents accompanying the batch to slaughter. This is a legal requirement and the birds may not be slaughtered if this information is not provided. Further information Contact your nearest APHA office or DARD if you need more advice. You can also read the [InlineAttachment:4], which provides best practice for preventing salmonella."

/guidance/making-fertiliser-from-processed-animal-by-products-abps,"Find out how to make fertiliser from processed ABPs including bonemeal, and if you need approval to manufacture, store or transport it. Making fertiliser from processed animal by-products (ABPs)  Animal and Plant Health Agency Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs This guide applies to organic fertilisers or soil improvers that contain any of the following processed animal by-products ( ABPs ): processed animal proteins ( PAP ), a type of category 3 ABP meat and bone meal that is a category 2 ABP processed blood Read a description of ABP categories to find out what category 2 ABPs and PAP are. For guidance on other types of ABPs that can also be used as fertiliser, read specific guidance on: compost and digestate manure, digestive tract content and bat guano milk and milk products ash, shellfish shells and eggshells When you need approval to manufacture fertiliser You need approval to manufacture fertiliser in the following circumstances: you produce fertiliser at an approved ABP processing plant (you’ll need approval to manufacture fertiliser as well as approval to operate an ABP processing plant) you process digestate to produce prill (pellets) using a heat treatment you manufacture complex fertilisers, eg you mix sterilised poultry manure with seaweed or inorganic material (contact your nearest Animal and Plant Health Agency field office if you are unsure if your fertiliser is complex) Contact your nearest APHA field office to apply for approval. When you need to register as a manufacturer You need to register with APHA (but you don’t need approval) if either of the following apply: you purchase pre-processed ABP material but add an authorised mixing component so it can be sold as fertiliser you repackage pre-processed ABP material as fertiliser for use in gardening or on sports grounds (in this guide gardening refers to the cultivation of a garden, orchard or nursery to grow flowers, fruits, vegetables or ornamental plants at a private home or as part of a business) Contact your nearest APHA field office to register. When you need approval to store fertiliser You need approval to store fertiliser except in the following circumstances: you’re already approved or registered to manufacture fertiliser the fertiliser is stored where it’s going to be applied (eg at a farm, garden or sports ground) the fertiliser has entered the retail chain (eg fertiliser can be stored at a garden centre without approval) A storage warehouse for a chain of garden centres needs approval to store fertiliser, as does any warehouse receiving pre-packaged fertiliser imported from another country (in or outside the EU) via a border inspection post. Contact your nearest APHA office to apply for approval to store fertiliser. Registration requirements for businesses that transport fertiliser Hauliers transporting fertiliser need to register on the ABP transport database. Hauliers transporting bulk (unpackaged) consignments of fertiliser also need to register on the TSE (transmissible spongiform encephalopathy) database. Contact your nearest APHA office to register on the ABP transport or TSE databases. How to process ABP material for use in fertiliser You can’t use category 1 ABPs in fertiliser. You must process other ABPs before they can be used: category 2 ABPs must be processed using pressure sterilisation and permanently marked using GTH (glyceroltriheptanoate) category 3 ABPs can be processed using any EU approved processing method Find out what ABP category your material fits into . Adding a mixing component before use as a fertiliser You must add an authorised mixing component to any processed ABPs that this guidance applies to before you can use them as fertiliser. The mixing component is added to alert people that they should not allow farm animals to have access to it. The only exception is if the fertiliser is supplied in ready to sell packages of 50kg or less for use by final consumers in gardening or on sports grounds. Authorised mixing components for dry fertiliser products You can use these mixing components for dry fertiliser products that need to be mixed: Wood shavings (not bark chippings) that are: from clean and recently cut ‘virgin’ timber that has not been treated with paint or preservatives filtered to remove large pieces of wood screened to remove dust and other non-wood substances Limestone chips, grit or pellets of 2 to 5 millimetres in diameter. Inorganic fertiliser pellets of 2 to 5 mm in diameter. The mixing component has to make up more than 2% of the volume of the final fertiliser product. Authorised mixing components for wet fertiliser products You can use these mixing components for liquid fertiliser products that need to be mixed: For processed blood use either: hydrated lime (calcium dihydroxide solution in water) 1 to 1.5% solution of caustic soda until the final product Add either mixing component until the fertiliser has a pH of between 9 and 10. For fish meal suspension use: 10 millilitres of duramine solution per litre of fish meal suspension (duramine solution is duramine blue FCF 250% diluted to a 2.5% stock solution - 25 kilograms of duramine per 1,000 litres of water) How to record mixing components You must record details of the authorised mixing component that you have used in the commercial document for the product. For example: contains 1% caustic soda solution (pH of final product 9-10). How to propose new mixing components You can propose new mixing components by contacting: Lead Veterinary Officer National Feed Audit APHA Kendal Rd Harlescott Shrewsbury SY1 4HD Telephone: 01743 450 625 You’ll have to provide samples of your proposed mixing component. Any mixing component that you suggest should: discourage animals from feeding on the fertiliser not harm animal health if it is ingested not have an adverse impact on the environment be able to be easily mixed into fertiliser be readily available and not expensive to obtain be visible to inspectors after it has been mixed How and when to test your products for bacteria You must send samples of your fertiliser for laboratory testing to check your products don’t pose a risk to public and animal health. You must submit samples each week for testing for the following bacteria: Enterobacteriaceae Salmonella You should take your samples either when your product is in storage or when you take it out of storage. Processors processing liquid blood can take samples as the processed blood leaves the cooker. Find out more about laboratory testing requirements for ABPs including where to send them for testing and how to interpret results. Record keeping and commercial documents requirements You must follow the same commercial record keeping practice as the rest of the ABP industry. Retailers such as garden centres selling to non-business customers within the UK don’t need to keep records or use commercial documents. How to label your products You must follow the rules on labelling ABPs when moving or storing any product containing ABPs . Any finished fertiliser product covered by this guidance also needs to be labelled: ‘organic fertilisers or soil improvers: no grazing of farmed animals or use of crops as herbage for at least 21 days following application’. If you can’t label the product for some reason (for example if the product is a bulk consignment of liquid processed blood) you have to provide the same message in writing to the landowner when you deliver the goods. You don’t have to label fertiliser if it meets all of the following conditions: weighs 50kg or less will be sold directly to final consumers without repackaging is intended for use in gardening or on sports grounds Additional requirements for fertiliser containing dried blood, hoofs or horns You must provide accompanying documentation or attach a label to fertilisers containing the following ABPs , declaring nitrogen content as a percentage of the product’s overall weight: dried blood hoofs hoofs and horns The nitrogen content of any sample taken from a product must be within 0.5 percentage points of the content level you declared. Additional requirements for fertiliser containing bone phosphate You must provide accompanying documentation or attach a label to fertilisers containing precipitated bone phosphate or dicalcium bone phosphate, declaring phosphorus pentoxide content as a percentage of the product’s overall weight. The phosphorus pentoxide content of any sample taken from a product must fall within 1 percentage point of the content level you declared. Additional requirements for fertiliser containing meat or bone meal or fish manure or guano You must provide accompanying documentation or attach a label to fertilisers containing any of the following ABPs , declaring nitrogen and phosphorus pentoxide content as percentages of the overall product weight: bone meal meat and bone meal meat meal meat and bone tankage carcase meal steamed bone flour steamed bone meal fish guano fish manure The nitrogen content of any sample taken from a product must fall within 0.5 percentage points of the content level you declared. The phosphorus pentoxide content of any sample taken from a bone meal product must fall within 1.5 percentage points of the content level you declared. The phosphorus pentoxide content of a sample taken from a product containing any of the other ABPs must fall within 1 percentage point of the content level you declared. Additional requirements for fertiliser containing raw guano You must provide accompanying documentation or attach a label to fertiliser containing raw guano declaring nitrogen, phosphorus pentoxide and potassium oxide content as percentages of the overall product weight. The nitrogen content of any sample taken from a raw guano product must be within 20 percent of the content level you declared, and no more than: 1.5 percentage points above the content level you declared 0.25 percentage points below the content level you declared The phosphorus pentoxide content of any sample taken from a raw guano product must be within 10 percent of the content level you declared and no more than 2 percentage points above the content level you declared. The potassium oxide content of any sample taken from a raw guano product must be within 20 percent of the content level you declared. Additional requirements for fertiliser containing pulverised sea shells You must provide accompanying documentation or attach a label to fertiliser containing pulverised seas shells declaring the neutralising value. The neutralising value must be expressed as the calcium oxide equivalent content as a percentage of the overall product weight. The calcium oxide equivalent content of any sample taken from a product must be within 5 percent of the content level you declared."
/government/news/apha-announces-new-post-mortem-examination-expert-provider-for-wales,"APHA has awarded the contract for the provision of subsidised PM examinations in Wales to Iechyd Da, a consortium of independent veterinary practices based in Wales.  APHA announces new post mortem examination expert provider for Wales  Animal and Plant Health Agency Welsh Government The new service will be introduced in stages. Initially there will be a post-mortem examination ( PME ) service covering locations within an hour’s journey time from the former APHA Aberystwyth Veterinary Investigation Centre. A carcase collection service will then be introduced for North Wales, followed by a combination of carcase collection and PME satellite sites for remaining areas, to be determined after consultation with vets in the area. Further details will be published in early 2015. Iechyd Da will work in collaboration with Aberystwyth University from the former APHA Veterinary Investigation Centre facility in Aberystwyth. They will be available to support veterinary businesses in Wales in their diagnostic work from early 2015. They will also form part of an enhanced scanning surveillance network which includes APHA , the wider veterinary profession and the livestock industry. Rebecca Evans, Welsh Government Deputy Minister for Farming and Food, said: “The award of this contract to Iechydd Da is excellent news as it enhances disease surveillance in Wales. This announcement will mean that private vets and farmers will have better access to post mortem examination and diagnostic services. “As demonstrated by the recent avian flu outbreak, there are constant threats to animal health and having improved coverage will strengthen surveillance here in Wales and will help to detect and manage these risks.” Vets wishing to submit a carcase must first discuss this with the post mortem facility. A disposal fee will be charged for any carcases received without prior agreement. Postal submissions should continue to be sent to APHA ’s laboratory at Shrewsbury. Since the closure of APHA ’s Aberystwyth site on 31 August 2014, carcases have been delivered to a collection centre at Lampeter (or collected on farm depending on the farm’s location) after discussion with the duty Veterinary Investigation Officer at APHA Carmarthen. This arrangement will continue until the new service is operational. From early 2015 carcases from premises within one hour’s travel of Aberyswyth will need to be delivered to the post-mortem facility at Aberystwyth. Iechyd Da is in the process of establishing a carcase transport service for a wider area to include North Wales. [InlineAttachment:1]"

/guidance/salmonella-get-your-breeding-chickens-tested,"Find out when and how to take samples for testing, and what happens if one of your flocks tests positive.  Salmonella: get your breeding chickens tested  Animal and Plant Health Agency Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs You must take samples and send them to a laboratory for testing if you have a flock of 250 or more breeding birds. This is part of the national control programme ( NCP ) for salmonella, which aims to control salmonella in poultry flocks across the EU. You must sample each of your flocks. A flock is a group of birds that shares the same air space, eg a chicken house or range. If you’re not sure if your birds are considered to be in one or more flock, you can ask for advice from the Animal and Plant Health Agency ( APHA ) in England, Scotland or Wales, or the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development ( DARD ) in Northern Ireland. When you don’t have to test a flock You don’t have to have your flock tested if you only produce hatching eggs or day-old chicks for scientific or research purposes. Register your flocks and hatchery before you get them tested You must register each premises where you keep your flocks on one of the following: the Great Britain Poultry Register if you’re in England, Scotland or Wales the Northern Ireland Poultry Register if you farm in Northern Ireland You must register your hatchery if it can incubate 1,000 or more eggs. When you must not sample Avoid taking samples during or shortly after giving antimicrobials (antibiotics) that affect salmonella. APHA or DARD could declare your flock positive for salmonella if: inspectors find from the flock medicine book that you’ve given antimicrobials the laboratory tests find antimicrobials in samples taken by inspectors Contact one of the following for guidance on when to test after giving antimicrobials: the vet who prescribed the antimicrobials APHA if you farm in England, Scotland or Wales DARD if you farm in Northern Ireland Paying for sampling equipment and tests You need to buy your own sampling equipment. Contact one of the following to find out where: your vet the government-approved laboratory you plan to send samples to your nearest APHA office DARD You’ll also have to pay the laboratory charges for salmonella testing for your own samples and for annual APHA or DARD samples. Contact DARD for details of fees in Northern Ireland. Official sampling at your premises Officials will visit your premises to take official samples. In Northern Ireland, DARD will take the official samples. In England, Scotland or Wales the official will be from APHA (possibly your vet if authorised to take official samples on behalf of APHA ). When to take samples When you need to take samples 3 times a year If Salmonella Enteritidis, Salmonella Typhimurium or monophasic strains of Typhimurium have been detected on your holding in the last year, you need to take samples: within 4 weeks of a flock moving to the laying unit or house in the middle of lay within the last 8 weeks of egg production When you need to take samples twice a year If no Salmonella enteritidis, Salmonella typhimurium or monophasic strains of typhimurium have been detected on your holding in the last year, you only need to take these samples near the beginning of lay and near the end of lay. Take samples from your rearing flock You must take samples at all of the following times: on the day the chicks arrive from a hatchery when they are 4 weeks old 2 weeks before you move them to the laying unit Samples to send on the day of arrival Send the following for laboratory testing on the day of arrival: the liners from boxes used to deliver the chicks - one box for every 500 chicks from each delivery, up to 10 boxes any chicks that are dead on arrival or that you cull within 24 hours of arrival, up to 60 carcasses from each hatchery Samples to send when the chicks are older Take samples using one of the following methods when the chicks are 4 weeks old, and again 2 weeks before you move them to the laying unit: 2 pairs of boot swabs for floor-reared birds 25 grams of a composite faeces sample for cage-reared or floor-reared birds (composite means the faeces are from many birds in the flock) Take composite faeces samples from your rearing flocks Use the following method to take a composite faeces sample from a rearing flock: Take several 1g samples from sites selected to represent the whole building, for cage-reared hens, or from all the buildings floor-reared hens go into, using a spatula or your hand inside a plastic glove or a plastic bag. Mix the 1g samples together to make a composite sample. Take 25g from the composite sample to send to the laboratory. Use this table to find out the minimum number of 1g samples you need to take. Number of birds kept in building Minimum number of faeces samples 1 to 24 A number equal to the total number of birds up to a maximum of 20 birds. 25 to 29 20 30 to 39 25 40 to 49 30 50 to 59 35 60 to 89 40 90 to 199 50 200 to 499 55 500+ 60 Take samples from adult breeding flocks Sample your adult breeding flocks every 3 weeks during the laying period, unless there’s been a positive test result for salmonella on your holding in the past 12 months. You can take any of the following as samples from your flock: 5 pairs of boot swabs one pair of boot swabs and one dust sample 2 composite faeces samples of 150g each Prepare to take samples Take samples in the existing bedding - don’t put new bedding down. Gather all the equipment you’ll need before you go into the laying house to prevent contamination. Take care to avoid contamination if you keep other animals (especially pigs or cattle) on your premises. To prevent disinfectant or sanitiser affecting your sample, you: shouldn’t use hand sanitiser on your plastic gloves should put on your plastic overboots after you’ve walked through disinfectant If you do wear plastic overboots when you walk through disinfectant, you should put on a another pair afterwards to protect the boot swabs from the disinfectant. Take boot swab samples You should use: disposable plastic overboots 2 pairs of boot swabs tap water or bottled still water for moistening boot swabs - never use sparkling water or water treated on the farm with antibacterial agents or acids disposable plastic gloves sealable bags or sample pots packaging for sending your sample bags or pots to the laboratory Take 5 pairs of boot swabs from each flock. Moisten the boot swabs with water before you take samples. Divide the house into 5 equal parts for sampling, and use one pair of boot swabs in each part. Take at least 100 steps with each pair of boot swabs, walking round the entire house. Drag your feet on the floor to pick up as much material as possible. If the house is divided into several pens, spend more time in the larger pens and less in the smaller pens. When you’ve finished sampling, take the boot swabs off and turn them inside out carefully so that the faeces you’ve collected stays on them. Put 2 pairs of boot swabs together in one package and 3 pairs together in another package to send to the laboratory. Take dust samples Choose from one of these ways of taking a dust sample: collect 100g of dust from multiple places in the house and put it in a pot use one or more moistened fabric swabs with a total surface area of at least 900sq cms, put on new disposable gloves, and coat both sides of the swabs with dust collected from multiple places in the house Avoid collecting dust from feeding systems. You must package dust swabs separately from boot swabs. Take composite faeces samples from caged flocks If you’ve installed dropping belts or scrapers in your cages: run the belts or scrapers on the day you collect samples, to make sure that you pick up fresh faeces take faeces from every row or tier of the cage take faeces from the build-up on scrapers and at the end of belts If you have a step-cage system without belts and scrapers, collect faeces from throughout the deep pit. Collect the samples using a spatula or your hand inside a plastic glove or a plastic bag. Send 2 samples of at least 150g each to the laboratory. Label samples You must label each sample submission form with a label that includes: the date you took the sample your registration number or your County Parish Holding (CPH) number or DARD flock number the identification of the flock - house name or number and the month and year you moved the flock into that house the name and address of the flock’s holding the age of the flock the number of birds in the flock the contact details of the person sending the sample Send samples to a laboratory You should send your samples on the day you collect them. Refrigerate them at 4°C if you can’t send your samples on that same day. You must not freeze samples. Make sure the testing laboratory begins testing your samples within 4 days of when you collected them, otherwise you’ll have to take new samples. You must send your salmonella NCP samples to a UK approved laboratory. Find laboratories approved by: DARD in Northern Ireland the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs ( Defra ) in England and Wales the Scottish government Tell APHA or DARD before moving birds to the laying unit You need to contact APHA or DARD at least 2 weeks before you move birds to the laying unit and provide the dates on which: you’ll be moving the flock to the laying unit you think the flock is likely to stop laying Get your test results The laboratory usually sends the results to: the person who sent the sample the person the sampled flock is registered to APHA or DARD if the sample tests positive for salmonella If your samples test positive for salmonella APHA or DARD can send an officer to take samples if the laboratory finds that one of your flocks has tested positive for: Salmonella enteritidis Salmonella typhimurium (including monophasic Salmonella typhimurium) Salmonella hadar Salmonella infantis Salmonella virchow APHA or DARD can also take 5 carcasses and store their organs. They may be tested for antimicrobials if the official control samples are negative. If the official samples confirm Salmonella enteritidis or Salmonella typhimurium (including monophasic Salmonella typhimurium) you’ll have to: keep the flock that tested positive and its eggs on the farm make sure that the entire flock is slaughtered as soon as possible make sure that all eggs put in the hatchery since the time the flock was found to be infected are destroyed APHA or DARD may check your hatchery to see if salmonella has become resident. In Northern Ireland DARD will check back in 6 weeks. You must: increase your biosecurity measures to prevent the spread of salmonella thoroughly clean and disinfect the affected house take samples after the thorough cleaning and disinfection You can only move new birds into the house if the results of the tests on the post-cleaning samples are negative. If the sample confirms the presence of Salmonella hadar, Salmonella infantis or Salmonella virchow, you will have to make a plan with your vet and APHA or DARD to reduce or eliminate salmonella from the flock. A government vet will also arrange to visit you and give you advice on salmonella control. APHA or DARD will collect official samples from all your other flocks to check if they have salmonella. Get compensation If your birds are culled, Defra will automatically compensate you. Keep records Keep records for at least 2 years. APHA or DARD officials can check your records at any time, eg during a routine NCP visit or a visit after a positive test result. You must send these records to your nearest APHA office or DARD every 6 months, within 15 working days of the last working day of June and December. Keep test records For each test you must record the: date you took the sample the flock identification, which is the flock’s house name or number, and the month and year the flock moved into the house type of sample, eg boot swab or dust sample age of the flock date you plan to have the flock slaughtered laboratory that tested the sample test result Keep movement records You need to record any movement of birds to or from your holding. For each movement record the: date of movement number of birds age of the birds house name or number, and the month and year the flock moved onto your holding address that the birds moved from (including the building name or number) address that the birds moved to (including the building name or number) Food chain information documents You must declare the flock’s most recent salmonella test result in the food chain information ( FCI ) documents that you send with the birds to slaughter if you market any meat from your birds as fresh meat. You don’t have to declare the most recent salmonella test if you heat treat all the meat from the flock before marketing it for human consumption. Declare salmonella test results You must declare all the NCP Salmonella test results, negative or positive, as well as the date the sample was taken from the flock in the Food Chain Information ( FCI ) documents accompanying the batch to slaughter. This is a legal requirement and the birds may not be slaughtered if this information is not provided. Further information Contact your nearest APHA office or DARD if you need more advice.

/guidance/salmonella-get-your-breeding-turkeys-tested,"Find out when and how to take samples for testing, and what happens if one of your flocks tests positive. Salmonella: get your breeding turkeys tested  Animal and Plant Health Agency Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs You must take samples and send them to an approved laboratory for testing if at any time in a 12-month period you keep 250 or more breeding turkeys. This is part of the national control programme ( NCP ) for salmonella, which aims to control salmonella in poultry flocks across the EU. You must sample each of your breeding flocks. A flock is a group of birds that shares the same house or range area. If you’re not sure if your birds are considered to be in one or more flock, you can ask for advice from the Animal and Plant Health Agency ( APHA ) in England, Scotland or Wales, or the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development ( DARD ) in Northern Ireland. When you don’t have to test a flock You don’t have to test a flock if you either: farm fewer than 500 birds only produce birds for private use (not for sale) only sell direct to consumers through farm gate sales or to local retailers that only supply consumers Register your flocks and hatchery before you get them tested You must register each premises where you keep your flocks on one of the following: the Great Britain Poultry Register if you’re in England, Scotland or Wales the Northern Ireland Poultry Register if you farm in Northern Ireland When you must not sample Avoid taking samples during or shortly after giving antimicrobials (antibiotics) that affect salmonella. APHA or DARD could declare your flock positive for salmonella if: inspectors see from the flock medicine book that you’ve given antimicrobials the laboratory suspects that there may be disinfectant and antimicrobials in your samples Contact one of the following for guidance on when to test after giving antimicrobials: your vet (who will have prescribed the antimicrobials) APHA if you farm in England, Scotland or Wales DARD if you farm in Northern Ireland Don’t collect samples unless you’re sure they’ll arrive at the laboratory and it can start testing them within 96 hours (4 days) of sampling. Before you collect samples, check with your chosen laboratory to find out if they can handle samples sent to them on a Thursday or a Friday. Paying for sampling equipment and tests You need to buy your own sampling equipment. Contact one of the following to find out where: your vet the government-approved laboratory you plan to send samples to your nearest APHA office in England, Scotland or Wales DARD in Northern Ireland You’ll also have to pay the laboratory charges for salmonella testing for your own samples and for official samples. Contact DARD for for details of fees in Northern Ireland. You must regularly test each breeding flock as part of the NCP . You can do the sampling: at the hatchery - you must sample adult flocks must be sampled every 3 weeks on farm - you can sample every 4 weeks as long as your flock hasn’t recently tested positive for the salmonella strains (also known as serotype or serovars) covered by the NCP Official sampling at your premises Officials will visit your premises in the lifetime of the flock to take routine official. If you’re in England, Scotland or Wales it’ll be an official from APHA , an authorised vet or an independent control body (if your flock is is registered with the Quality British Turkeys assurance scheme). In Northern Ireland it’ll be an official from DARD . They’ll sample birds aged between 30 and 45 weeks of age from all breeding flocks that are on holds that require NCP sampling. If the official’s from APHA or DARD they can also take samples: if Salmonella enteritidis or Salmonella typhimurium has been detected in another flock or in a previous crop of flocks on your holding from all the flocks on your holding if a positive test for Salmonella enteritidis or Salmonella typhimurium at a hatchery has been traced back to one of your flocks from flocks where there’s no evidence of testing if they think a test result from your samples is inaccurate Choose a hatchery sampling method Choose one of the following ways to take samples: broken eggshells hatcher basket liners that are visibly soiled - but check that your laboratory accepts your type of hatcher basket liner fabric swabs - if there are more than 50,000 eggs from one flock in the hatchery, and you must take 2 samples for that flock You must sample enough hatchers to make sure that you include 80% of the eggs from the flock you’re sampling in the sample that you collect. Take hatchery samples You should gather the plastic gloves, plastic bags and packaging you’ll need before you go into the hatchery. This is to prevent contamination before, during and after sampling. How to take an eggshell sample Before sampling, check that the lab you plan to submit the samples to can accept your liners. Some labs will not be able to accept certain types of hatcher liners. Put on 2 new pairs of plastic gloves. Take at least 10 grams of broken eggshells from each of 25 hatcher baskets. Crush and mix them thoroughly in a strong plastic bag (making sure that the bag and your gloves aren’t damaged to avoid any contamination that could lead to a false positive result). Put 25g of the crushed mixture into a pot to send to the laboratory. How to take a hatcher liner sample Put on a new pair of plastic gloves. Choose at least one square metre (sq m) of hatcher basket liners from 5 hatcher baskets that have contained eggs from the flock you need to sample. Put the liners from different flocks into separate plastic bags to send to the laboratory. How to take a hatcher fluff and dust sample Put on a new pair of plastic gloves, ensuring that there is no contamination with disinfectant. Moisten a fabric swab that has an area of at least 900 square centimetres (sq cm). Use tap water or still bottled water - never use sparkling water or water treated on the farm with antibacterials or acid. Swab fluff and dust from 5 different places, including the floor of the hatcher, as soon as the poults (young turkeys) have been removed and before you start cleaning. Swab from the whole area of the bottom of at least 5 different hatcher baskets. Make sure the swab is completely covered on both sides. Put the swab into a sealable bag to send to the laboratory. Take samples from your breeding flocks Sample your one-day-old poults You must send 10 poult box liners per flock per hatchery source with all the contents, including unhatched eggs, eggshells, all poults found dead or culled (killed) on arrival. Sample your poults at 4 weeks and 2 weeks before moving them to the laying unit You must send 5 pairs of boot swabs. Either: package them in 2 separate batches of 5 boot swabs each put 2 pairs of boot swabs together in one bag or pot, and 3 pairs together in another bag or pot You must also send: one pair of boot swabs and one dust swab of 900sq cm - package them separately 2 or more hand-held faecal swabs with a total surface area of 900sq cm if you can’t use boot swabs - this is only allowed if you have fewer than 100 turkeys at the time of sampling From adult breeding birds Once you have moved birds into the laying unit, you must either take samples from them on your holding or sample their eggs in the hatchery. You must take samples on the holding from breeding turkeys that lay hatching eggs that you sell to farms in other EU member states. You must take samples every 4 weeks if you meet all the following conditions: you sample your breeding birds on your holding rather than sampling their eggs at a hatchery you intend to keep 250 birds or more breeding birds over the course of a year there has been no Salmonella enteriditis or Salmonella typhimurium on your holding in the last 2 years You must take samples every 3 weeks if: you have the eggs from your breeding birds sampled at a hatchery there has been Salmonella enteriditis or Salmonella typhimurium on your holding in the last 2 years Collect samples and have the result back in time to send it with the birds to slaughter if you’re sending breeding birds to slaughter for human consumption. If your birds will be slaughtered at less than 101 days of age then you must collect collect samples in the 3 weeks before slaughter unless they’re organic turkeys. If your birds will be slaughtered at more than 100 days of age (or are younger but are organic turkeys), then you must collect samples in the 6 weeks before slaughter. What kinds of samples you can take On your holding you can take samples in one of the following ways: You must also send: 5 pairs of boot swabs - either package them in 2 separate batches of 5 boot swabs each, or put 2 pairs of boot swabs together in one bag or pot, and 3 pairs together in another bag or pot one pair of boot swabs and one dust swab of 900sq cm - package them separately 2 or more hand-held faecal swabs with a total surface area of 900sq cm - but this is only allowed if you can’t use boot swabs and you have fewer than 100 turkeys at the time of sampling - package them in 2 batches In the hatchery you can take one of the following types of samples: a total of 1sq m of liners that are visibly soiled, taken from 5 hatcher baskets fabric swabs with a total surface area of 900sq cm from 5 places in the hatcher, including at least one sample from the floor of the hatcher fabric swabs with a total surface area of 900sq cm from the whole surface of the bottom of at least 5 different hatcher baskets 10g of broken eggshells from each of 25 hatcher baskets, making 250g broken eggshells in total You must take 2 samples for that flock if there are more than 50,000 eggs from one flock in the hatchery. How to take samples Prepare to take a boot swab sample You should use: disposable plastic overboots 5 pairs of boot swabs - these must be absorbent enough to soak up moisture, and you can also use tubegauze ‘socks’ or premoistened commercial swabs tap water or bottled still water for moistening boot swabs - never use sparkling water or water treated on the farm with antibacterial agents or acids disposable plastic gloves sealable bags or sample pots packaging for sending your sample bags or pots to the laboratory Take samples in the existing bedding (litter) - don’t put new bedding down. You should gather all the equipment you’re going to need before you go into the laying house, to prevent contamination before, during and after sampling. You should take special care to avoid contamination if you keep other animals (especially pigs or cattle) on your premises. To prevent disinfectant or sanitiser affecting your sample, you: shouldn’t use hand sanitiser on your plastic gloves should put on your plastic overboots after you’ve walked through disinfectant If you do wear plastic overboots when you walk through disinfectant, you should put on another pair afterwards to protect the boot swabs from the disinfectant. Taking a boot swab sample You should sample only the inside of the house. Also, avoid sampling the areas just inside doors and pop holes, as they may have been contaminated by material from outdoors. Moisten the boot swabs before you take samples by pouring water inside them or shaking them in a container of water. You can either just collect boot swabs, or a mixture of boot swabs and dust samples. Only collecting boot swabs If just collecting boot swabs you must take 5 pairs of boot swabs from each flock. Divide the house into 5 equal parts for sampling, and use one pair of boot swabs in each part. Take at least 100 steps in each pair of boot swabs. Swab every part of the house. Drag your feet on the floor to pick up as much material you can. If the house is divided into several pens, spend more time in the larger pens and less in the smaller pens. Collecting boot swabs and dust samples If collecting a combination of boot swabs and dust sample take one pair of boot swabs from each flock, walking around the entire house. Then take at least 100 steps in the pari of boot swabs. Swab every part of the house. Drag your feet on the floor to pick up as much material as you can. If the house is divided into several pens, spend more time in the larger pens and less in the smaller pens. When you’ve finished sampling When you’ve finished sampling, take off the boot swabs and turn them inside out so that all the faeces you’ve collected stays on them. Put 2 pairs of boot swabs together in one bag or pot and 3 pairs together in another bag or pot, or 5 boot swabs in one container and the other 5 in the second. Once in the appropriate container, package them together and send them to the laboratory. How to take a dust sample You should collect the plastic gloves, plastic bags and packaging that you’ll need before you go into the house. This is to prevent contamination before, during and after sampling. Put on new plastic gloves - make sure you don’t contaminate them with disinfectant. Open out the hand-held dust swab. The total area of the swab must be at least 900sq cm. Moisten the dust swab using tap water or bottled still water (never use sparkling water or water treated on the farm with antibacterial agents or acids). Swab at least 20 different places around the house including ledges, partitions, ventilation grills and anywhere else dust has settled. Don’t take samples from feeding systems. Make sure that both sides of the swab are completely covered with dust. Package the swab and dust into a sealable bag or pot to send to the laboratory. How to take faecal swabs Collect the plastic gloves, plastic bags and packaging that you’ll need before you go into the house. This is to prevent contamination before, during and after sampling. Put on new plastic gloves - make sure you don’t contaminate them with disinfectant. Open out the hand-held dust swabs. You’ll need at least 2 the total area of the swabs must be at least 900sq cm. Moisten the swab using tap water or bottled still water (never use sparkling water or water treated on the farm with antibacterial agents or acids) Thoroughly swab the pen area, the floor and any perches in several different areas where faeces has built up. Make sure that both sides of the swab are completely covered in faeces. Place the swabs into 2 sealable bags or pots to send to the laboratory. Make sure you follow these batching instructions so that the laboratory accepts your samples. Label samples On each sample you must include: the date you took the sample your registration number or your County Parish Holding (CPH) number or DARD flock number the identification of the flock - house name or number and the month and year you moved the flock into that house the name and address of the flock’s holding the age of the flock the number of birds in the flock the contact details of the person sending the sample For hatchery samples, add the name of the hatchery and the hatcher machine number Send samples to a laboratory You should send your samples on the day you collect them. Refrigerate your samples at 2 to 8°C if you can’t send them on that same day. You must not freeze samples. Make sure the testing laboratory gets your samples within 48 hours of when you collected them (and that they can test them within 96 hours), otherwise you’ll have to take new samples. You must send your samples to a UK laboratory that’s approved to test salmonella NCP samples. Find laboratories approved by: DARD in Northern Ireland the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs ( Defra ) in England and Wales the Scottish government in Scotland Get your test results The laboratory usually sends the results to: the person who sent the sample the person the sampled flock is registered to APHA or DARD if the sample tests positive for salmonella If your samples test positive for salmonella What happens if a hatchery sample tests positive If one of your samples or an official sample from a hatchery tests positive for Salmonella enteritidis or Salmonella typhimurium, APHA or DARD will take samples from all the flocks on your holding. If Salmonella enteritidis or Salmonella typhimurium is confirmed, you must keep your positive flocks and eggs laid by birds in the farm. You must slaughter all the birds in the positive flocks. APHA or DARD will contact you to discuss the arrangements for slaughtering all the birds in the positive flocks and destroying all hatching eggs that might be infected (including those already at the hatchery). APHA or DARD will also place the hatchery under a movement restriction. This means that you will only be allowed to move equipment, animals or animal products on to or off your hatchery with a licence from APHA or DARD . They may also carry an audit of the hatchery, including tests to see if salmonella has become resident. APHA or DARD will only lift the movement restrictions after you clean and disinfect your hatchery and test results come back negative What happens if a sample from a breeding holding tests positive If one of the samples you submit from a breeding holding tests positive for salmonella APHA or DARD will take a further sample to confirm Salmonella Enteritidis or Salmonella Typhimurium is present. If the official samples test positive for Salmonella Enteritidis or Salmonella Typhimurium, APHA or DARD will contact you to tell you what you have to do. This will include all of the following: keeping the birds and eggs from the positive flocks on your farm having your positive flock or flocks slaughtered destroying your hatching eggs, if those eggs were laid while the flock was positive for salmonella You won’t have to pay for any samples or testing carried out by APHA or DARD because of a positive test result. Get compensation You’ll automatically get compensation for breeding birds you need to cull (kill) if your flock tests positive for Salmonella Enteritidis or Salmonella Typhimurium following official sampling. Keep records Keep records for at least 2 years. APHA or DARD officials can check your records at any time, eg during a routine NCP visit or a visit after a positive test result. You must send these records to your nearest APHA office or DARD every 6 months, within 15 working days of the last working day of June and December. Keep test records For each test you must record the: date you took the sample the flock identification, which is the flock’s house name or number, and the month and year the flock moved into the house type of sample, eg boot swab or dust sample age of the flock date you plan to have the flock slaughtered laboratory that tested the sample test result Keep movement records You need to record any movement of birds to or from your holding. For each movement record the: date of movement number of birds age of the birds house name or number, and the month and year the flock moved onto your holding address that the birds moved from (including the building name or number) address that the birds moved to (including the building name or number) Food chain information documents You must declare the flock’s most recent salmonella test result in the food chain information ( FCI ) documents that you send with the birds to slaughter if you market any meat from your birds as fresh meat. You don’t have to declare the most recent salmonella test if you heat treat all the meat from the flock before marketing it for human consumption. Declare salmonella test results You must declare all the NCP Salmonella test results, negative or positive, as well as the date the sample was taken from the flock in the Food Chain Information ( FCI ) documents accompanying the batch to slaughter. This is a legal requirement and the birds may not be slaughtered if this information is not provided. Further information Contact your nearest APHA or DARD office if you need advice.

Contact DARD for details in Northern Ireland. Official sampling at your premises APHA or DARD officials will collect samples from: 10% of holdings with more than 5,000 broiler birds - you’ll have to pay for these samples all your flocks after your previous set of flocks tested positive flocks where there’s no evidence of testing or where NCP rules haven’t been followed Take samples from your flock You must take samples from your flocks within a period of 3 weeks before the birds are slaughtered. If you send part of a flock to slaughter and the sample date exceeds the 3 weeks, you must take another sample from the flock which is being sent to slaughter. All birds must arrive at the slaughterhouse with the salmonella NCP test result and the date the sample was taken recorded in the Food Chain Information ( FCI ) documents accompanying the batch You must make sure that all birds arrive at the slaughterhouse with the following recorded in the Food Chain Information ( FCI ) documents accompanying the batch to slaughter: the NCP Salmonella test result, negative or positive the date the sample was taken from the flock Organic birds and birds over 81 days old Contact APHA or DARD to find out if you can sample these birds up to 6 weeks before they are slaughtered. What kind of samples you need to provide You can provide samples from your flock in any of the following ways: 2 pairs of boot swabs one pair of boot swabs and 100g dust sample, or one hand-held dust swab one or more hand-held faecal swabs, but only if you can’t use boot swabs and you have fewer than 2,000 chickens (birds) at the time of sampling How to sample your flock You’ll need to sample your flock in different ways depending on whether you’re taking a: boot swab sample dust sample faecal swab Prepare to take samples Take samples in the existing bedding - don’t put new bedding down. You should gather all the equipment you’re going to need before you go into the laying house to prevent contamination before, during and after sampling. Take care to avoid contamination if you keep other animals (especially pigs or cattle) on your premises. To prevent disinfectant or sanitiser affecting your sample, you: shouldn’t use hand sanitiser on your plastic gloves should put on your plastic overboots after you’ve walked through disinfectant If you do wear plastic overboots when you walk through disinfectant, you should put on another pair afterwards to protect the boot swabs from the disinfectant. How to take boot swab samples You should use: disposable plastic overboots 2 pairs of boot swabs tap water or bottled still water for moistening boot swabs - never use sparkling water or water treated on the farm with antibacterial agents or acids disposable plastic gloves sealable bags or sample pots packaging for sending your sample bags or pots to the laboratory Sample only the inside of the house, even if you’re sampling free-range birds that spend part of the day outside. Avoid sampling areas just inside doors and pop holes, as they may have been contaminated by material from outdoors. Take 2 pairs of boot swabs from each flock. Moisten the boot swabs with water before you take samples. Divide the house into 2 equal parts for sampling, and use one pair of boot swabs in each part. Take at least 100 steps with each pair of boot swabs, walking round 50% of each part. Drag your feet on the floor to pick up as much material as possible. If the house is divided into several pens, spend more time in the larger pens and less in the smaller pens. When you’ve finished sampling, take the boot swabs off and turn them inside out carefully so that the material you’ve collected stays on them. Put the boot swabs together in a sealable bag to send to the laboratory. How to take dust samples Choose from one of these ways of taking a dust sample: collect 100 grams of dust from as many dusty surfaces as possible in the house and put it in a pot use one or more moistened fabric swabs with a total surface area of at least 900 sq cm, put on new disposable gloves, and coat both sides of the swabs with dust collected from multiple places in the house Avoid collecting dust from feeding systems. You must package dust swabs separately from boot swabs. Take faecal swabs You should use: new plastic gloves 2 or more swabs with a surface area of 900 sq cms each, which you have moistened and opened out Rub the swabs over several different areas where faeces has built up. Cover the whole of the front and back of the swabs in faeces. Seal the covered swabs in a bag. Label samples You must label each sample with a sample submission form that states: the date you took the sample your registration number or your County Parish Holding (CPH) number or DARD flock number the identification of the flock - house name or number and the month and year you moved the flock into that house the name and address of the flock’s holding the age of the flock the number of birds in the flock the contact details of the person sending the sample Send samples to a laboratory You should send your samples on the day you collect them and make sure they’re delivered the next day. Refrigerate them at 4°C if you can’t send your samples on that same day. You must not freeze samples. Make sure the testing laboratory begins to test your samples within 4 days of when you collected them, otherwise you’ll have to take new samples. If the samples are not tested within 96 hours (4 days) you will have to take another set of samples. You must send your salmonella NCP samples to a UK approved laboratory. Find laboratories approved by: DARD in Northern Ireland the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs ( Defra ) in England and Wales the Scottish government Get your test results The laboratory usually sends the results to: the person who sent the sample the person the sampled flock is registered to APHA or DARD if the sample tests positive for salmonella If your samples test positive for salmonella You must declare in the Food Chain Information ( FCI ) documents accompanying the batch to slaughter: the NCP Salmonella test result, negative or positive the date the sample was taken from the flock This is a legal requirement and the birds may not be slaughtered if this information is not provided. If your NCP sample result was positive for any salmonella serovar you should speak to your private veterinary surgeon. They can give you advice on effective farm management and hygiene (biosecurity measures) to prevent disease transmission on your farm. You must clean and disinfect your holding if a sample tests positive for Salmonella Enteritidis or Salmonella Typhimurium (including monophasic Salmonella Typhimurium). A government vet may visit your holding to give you advice on salmonella control. In Northern Ireland, DARD will apply restrictions. APHA or DARD will visit and collect samples from all the flocks in the next crop of birds on your premises. If any of these official samples test positive, the flocks will be restricted and you’ll need a licence from APHA to move equipment, animals or animal products on or off your holding, including sending them to slaughter. In Northern Ireland, DARD will apply restrictions on each infected flock that will require a licence. You’ll have to clean and disinfect the premises again, this time under APHA supervision, once the shed is empty after the birds have been sent to slaughter. In Northern Ireland DARD will supervise the swabbing. APHA or DARD will take more samples after the supervised cleaning and disinfection. You’ll only be allowed to move equipment, animals or animal products freely (restrictions will be lifted) if they find salmonella has been removed from your holding, If any of the post-cleaning samples test positive: your flocks will remain under restriction APHA or DARD will collect more official samples from your next set of flocks you won’t be able to move equipment, animals or animal products onto or off your holding you’ll have to carry out further cleaning and disinfection APHA or DARD will revisit and collect samples from all the flocks in the next crop of birds on your premises. You won’t have to pay for any samples or testing done by APHA or DARD because of a positive test result. Keep records Keep records for at least 2 years. APHA or DARD officials can check your records at any time, eg during a routine NCP visit or a visit after a positive test result. Keep test records For each test you must record the: date you took the sample the flock identification, which is the flock’s house name or number, and the month and year the flock moved into the house type of sample, eg boot swab or dust sample age of the flock date you plan to have the flock slaughtered laboratory that tested the sample test result Keep movement records You need to record any movement of birds to or from your holding. For each movement record the: date of movement number of birds age of the birds house name or number, and the month and year the flock moved onto your holding address that the birds moved from (including the building name or number) address that the birds moved to (including the building name or number) Food chain information documents You must declare the flock’s most recent salmonella test result in the food chain information ( FCI ) documents that you send with the birds to slaughter if you market any meat from your birds as fresh meat. You don’t have to declare the most recent salmonella test if you heat treat all the meat from the flock before marketing it for human consumption. Declare salmonella test results You must declare all the NCP Salmonella test results, negative or positive, as well as the date the sample was taken from the flock in the Food Chain Information ( FCI ) documents accompanying the batch to slaughter. This is a legal requirement and the birds may not be slaughtered if this information is not provided. Further information Contact your nearest APHA office or DARD if you need more advice.

VAT doesn’t apply to these fees. Fees for poultry keepers Fees for official samples taken from your holding As part of the national control programmes, APHA takes samples from NCP eligible poultry holdings every year to monitor levels of salmonella. These samples are known as ‘routine official control samples’. You’ll be charged the following if APHA take official control samples from your holding as part of its annual monitoring: £23 for each half hour (or part half hour) spent by APHA officials taking the sample £15 per sample taken to cover the cost of laboratory testing a fixed fee depending on the type of flocks you keep Type of flock Fee Egg-laying chicken flocks £60 Breeding chicken flocks £96 Broiler (raised for meat) chicken flocks £89 Turkey flocks ( fattening or breeding ) £87 For example, if an APHA official spent 80 minutes taking 3 samples from an egg-laying chicken flock on your holding, you’d be charged £174, which includes: the £60 fixed fee 3 x £15 to cover the cost of laboratory testing each sample (total £45) 3 x £23 for the 2 half hours, and 1 part half hour taken (total £69) APHA will issue you a single invoice for both the laboratory and visit charges where APHA has carried out official sampling and the test is completed at an APHA laboratory.

/guidance/bluetongue,"How to spot bluetongue, what to do if you suspect it and measures to prevent its spread. Bluetongue: how to spot and report the disease  Animal and Plant Health Agency Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Bluetongue affects: sheep other ruminants such as cows and goats camelids such as llamas Humans aren’t affected, nor are animal products or meat. The last outbreak in England, Scotland or Wales was in 2007. Bluetongue is a notifiable disease - if you suspect it you must tell the Animal and Plant and Health Agency ( APHA ) immediately. Failure to do so is an offence. Current situation There is a high risk of bluetongue type 8 spreading into the UK towards the end of summer 2016 if infected midges are carried by the wind from France to the south-east of England. The exact level of risk depends on the level of disease in nearby areas of Europe, as well as the weather. You can get more information in the detailed assessment of the risk . How to spot bluetongue APHA will investigate if you report that you suspect a case of bluetongue. Along with the signs in this guide you can also get further details on the the clinical signs of bluetongue . In sheep In sheep the main signs of bluetongue are: ulcers in the mouth discharge of mucus and drooling from mouth and nose swelling of the mouth, head and neck and the coronary band (where the skin of the leg meets the horn of the foot) Other clinical signs include: red skin as a result of blood collecting beneath the surface fever lameness breathing problems In cattle Cattle are the main carriers of bluetongue. Infected cattle generally do not show any signs of the disease, but occasionally signs can include: swelling and ulcers in the mouth nasal discharge red skin and eyes as a result of blood collecting beneath the surface swollen teats tiredness Other animals rarely show signs of the disease. How bluetongue is spread Midges carry the bluetongue virus. The disease spreads when infected midges bite an animal affected by the disease. The midge season is normally March to September. The weather (especially temperature and wind direction) affects how the disease can spread. Preventing and controlling bluetongue You can help to prevent the disease by practising good biosecurity on your premises. If you trade animals from outside the UK, you should consider whether they might be carrying the disease. If bluetongue is confirmed APHA will control the outbreak by following the contingency plan for exotic notifiable diseases and the bluetongue control strategy . If there is an outbreak then APHA will place movement restrictions in zones around the affected premises. Getting your animals vaccinated You can get and use authorised bluetongue vaccines for your sheep and cattle. You need to get a general licence to vaccinate your animals if they’re outside a restricted zone for bluetongue. If you’re considering whether to vaccinate your animals, you should speak to your vet about the benefits of vaccination. It can take up to 6 weeks for your animals to be fully immune as your animals must have 2 injections of the vaccine, 3 weeks apart. Movement restrictions on animals or their germplasm in a bluetongue outbreak There are currently no restricted zones for bluetongue in place for England, Scotland or Wales. If there’s a bluetongue outbreak there’ll be restrictions on where you can move live ruminants (cattle, sheep, goats, deer or camlids) and germplasm (ovum, embryos or semen). These restrictions affect farmed and zoo animals. The controls depend on which restricted zone or area your animals or their germplasm are in and where you’re moving them to (for example for slaughter at an abattoir or to market). You may be able to move live ruminants or their germplasm out of or through a protection or surveillance zone under a specific or general licence following a veterinary risk assessment. A risk assessment is done on a case-by-case basis by APHA vets to assess the disease risk of moving animals and what needs to be done to avoid or minimise that risk. Restricted zones Restricted zones vary in size: control zone - at least 20km around infected premises protection zone - at least 100km around infected premises surveillance zone - at least 150km around the infected premises The ‘free area’ is the rest of England, Scotland and Wales that isn’t under movement restrictions. There are restrictions if you want to move your animals to and from a restricted zone for example for a show. Control zone You can’t move your ruminants between different premises within a control zone, to any other zones, or to the free area. Protection zone You can’t move animals to a premises in a control zone. You can move ruminants within the protection zone as long as there are no clinical signs of bluetongue on the day of transport. You can move ruminants to a surveillance zone, if it passes a veterinary risk assessment, if they’re either: for slaughter under licence at a designated abattoir - the Food Standards Agency will identify slaughterhouses to receive animals from a restricted area during any outbreak they meet the EU exemption criteria of annex 3 sections 5 to 7 (for example negative test or vaccinated) You can move ruminants and germplasm to a free area, Northern Ireland, or other EU countries if they pass a veterinary risk assessment or have a health certificate and: you move the animals under licence (for example for immediate slaughter) the animals meet meet the EU exemption criteria of annex 3 sections 5 to 7 (for example negative test or vaccinated) You can only move ruminants and their germplasm to a non-EU country (a ‘third country’) if they meet the import requirements of the destination country. Contact the APHA Centre for International Trade, Carlisle for more information (for example on a country’s requirements). You can only move animals and their germplasm to a third country if they meet the import requirements of the destination country. Surveillance zone You can’t move animals to a control zone. There are no restrictions on moving animals to a protection zone. You can move ruminants within the surveillance zone as long as there’s no clinical signs of bluetongue on the day of transport. You can move ruminants and germplasm to a free area, Northern Ireland, or other EU countries if they pass a veterinary risk assessment or have a health certificate and: you move the animals under licence (for example for immediate slaughter) the animals meet meet the EU exemption criteria of annex 3 sections 5 to 7 (for example negative test or vaccinated) You can only move ruminants and their germplasm to a third country if they meet the import requirements of the destination country. Contact the APHA Centre for International Trade, Carlisle for more information (for example on a country’s requirements). Moving live ruminants from a disease free area through a Restricted Zone You need to be licensed if you plan to transport animals from a disease free area to another disease-free area through a restricted zone. This is likely, following a veterinary risk assessment, to be by meeting the requirements of a general licence that would be published here in the event of an outbreak. Bluetongue legislation The main EU legislation on bluetongue is Directive 2007/75 . The main domestic legislation is the Bluetongue Regulations 2008 . Amendments to allow vaccination under licence were made by the Bluetongue (Amendment) Regulations 2012 ."

/government/news/new-data-may-reveal-world-war-one-practice-trenches,"Previously unrecorded World War One practice trenches are thought to have been discovered by the Coal Authority in Derbyshire, England. New data may reveal World War One practice trenches Environment Coal Authority Data from the Coal Authority may have revealed previously unrecorded World War One practice trenches used by soldiers as a battlefield near Buxton, Derbyshire. The features were discovered as part of the Authority’s research and development programme, which is looking at alternative ways to inspect mine entries in remote and rural areas. The Authority asked Bluesky, specialists in aerial surveys, to map the area with their airborne mapping system LiDAR. The LiDAR system uses lasers mounted onto aircraft to work out the distance between the sensor and the ground, or other targets such as buildings and vegetation. English Heritage was consulted by the Coal Authority on the project, as the statutory advisor on the historic environment. Phil Broughton, Project Manager (Research and Development and Mine Entry Inspections), Coal Authority, said: “Our team has inspected 103,000 mine entries in Britain since 2008 under our remit to protect the public and environment in coal mining areas. Most of the remaining mine entries to be inspected are in remote or rural locations, and we’re looking at innovative ways to carry these out using new technology. “We recently met English Heritage to show them our data and they identified features believed to be First World War practice trenches. We’ve now shared this with them for further investigation.” Simon Crutchley, from the Remote Sensing team at English Heritage said: “Whilst conducting analysis on the mining remains I noticed what appeared to be the classic crenelated forms of First World War trenches to the east of the mining. Further examination revealed what appears to be the extensive and unrecorded remains of First World War practice trenches, which could help tell the story of Derbyshire’s soldiers as they prepared to go to war.”"

The system will be delivered in partnership with industry and will include a free bureau service for those keepers who are not able to use computers themselves to report the moves. Reporting movements directly by computer or through the bureau service should reduce the burden on keepers and provide more accurate and timely information for disease control purposes. The existing Pigs (Records, Identification and Movement) Order 2007 (PRIMO) will be replaced by a new 2011 Order to provide the necessary legislative base. The consultation also sought views on three areas, these are: permitting the use of compressed air applied slap marks (tattoos) as an alternative  option to the standard  methods of identifying pigs; and reducing the retention period for on farm records from 6 years to 3 years and requiring individual identification and recording for boars moving to artificial insemination centres."
/government/consultations/marine-strategy-framework-directive-consultation-uk-initial-assessment-and-proposals-for-good-environmental-status,"A joint consultation between Defra, the Northern Ireland Executive, the Scottish Government and the Welsh Government was held between 27 March and 18 June 2012. Marine Strategy Framework Directive Consultation: UK initial assessment and proposals for Good Environmental Status  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Summary A joint consultation between Defra, the Northern Ireland Executive, the Scottish Government and the Welsh Government was held between 27 March and 18 June 2012.   The consultation sought views on the implementation of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD).  We are grateful for all the comments we received. The Directive requires Member States to take measures to achieve or maintain Good Environmental Status (GES) for their seas by 2020.  GES involves protecting the marine environment, preventing its deterioration and restoring it where practical, while using marine resources sustainably.  The Directive is very wide-ranging and sets out eleven descriptors of GES relating to biological diversity, non-indigenous species introductions, commercially exploited fish and shellfish populations, food webs, human-induced eutrophication, sea floor integrity, hydrographical conditions, concentrations_ _of contaminants, contaminants in fish and other seafood, litter and noise. The consultation focused on the initial stages of implementation and included a draft initial assessment of the state of the UK’s seas; proposals for UK characteristics of GES; proposals for detailed UK targets and indicators of GES; and an impact assessment setting out potential implications of the proposed GES targets and indicators.  Later consultations will cover proposals for the UK monitoring programmes for GES and the UK programmes of measures for achieving GES. For the UK, the Directive is part of a package of policies, united by our vision for ‘clean, healthy, safe, productive and biologically diverse oceans and seas’.  The Directive’s aims are consistent with this vision and current policies, such as the implementation of the Marine and Coastal Access Act, and the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy will play a major role in helping us achieve GES.

/government/news/consultation-for-demersal-discard-ban-launches,"A consultation to prepare for the demersal discard ban in January 2016 has now launched. Consultation for demersal discard ban launches  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Ensuring our fishermen can financially benefit from the second phase of the discard ban, which will end the wasteful practice that sees good fish thrown overboard, is the subject of a consultation launched today by Fisheries Minister George Eustice. Pelagic fishermen, whose catch includes herring and mackerel, were banned from the practice this month – this will be extended to the demersal fleet, whose catch includes plaice, hake and cod, in January 2016. Today’s (23 January) consultation considers how to implement the demersal ban in England, seeking views of those affected on the best ways to manage the landing obligation so our fishermen can benefit financially while fishing more sustainably. Commenting on the launch, Fisheries Minister George Eustice said: The discard ban is one of the most important changes to fisheries management in the last decade and follows three years of hard fought UK-led negotiations in Europe. We’re working closely with industry and the EU to ensure the discard ban is applied proportionately and works in practice for all fishermen. It’s crucial we help them adjust to the new reforms and make the transition to each phase of the ban as smooth as possible. This consultation and our research will inform how we handle fish that would have previously been discarded so it can be put to the best use, allowing us to achieve our shared goals of a thriving fishing industry, sustainable fish stocks and a healthy marine environment. The consultation will run until the 31 March 2015 and strengthen our negotiating position in Europe with crucial evidence, allowing us to develop an appropriate, fair and effective Discard Plan with member states we share demersal fisheries with. In addition we are undertaking national research to identify uses for previously discarded fish such as bait and fishmeal, and uncovering species with high survivability rates which could be exempted from the demersal discard ban. Together with the consultation this research will help us to make the most of the regional flexibilities the UK secured as part of the reformed Common Fisheries Policy. More information: Responses to the consultation can be made: using the online survey on our consultation To help prepare for the demersal ban we have been undertaking national research which includes: identifying uses for previously discarded fish such as bait and fishmeal and working with the industry to ensure this fish is managed appropriately once onshore and directed to appropriate markets improving the selectivity of fishing gears (through our long-term ASSIST programme) so the amount of unwanted by-catch is reduced in the first instance, as well as uncovering species with high survivability rates which could be exempted from the demersal discard ban. Defra funded research into plaice survivability is currently underway in Eastbourne In addition we will be encouraging our fishermen to take advantage of funding available from the middle of the summer through the new European Maritime and Fishing Fund. Using this fund fishermen will be able to apply for support to purchase highly selective gears, develop new and innovative fishing gears that are suitable for their local circumstances and help to develop markets for the fish that was previously discarded. We are also looking at improving our quota management systems and the possibility of applying de-minimis discarding exemptions where further selectivity is too difficult to achieve, or where landing the fish would exert a disproportionate cost on industry."

/guidance/sustainability-requirements-for-supplying-and-using-woodfuel,"How to demonstrate that woodfuel supplied for Renewables Obligations and Renewable Heat Incentive is from legal and sustainable sources. Sustainability requirements for supplying and using woodfuel  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Sustainability criteria under Renewables Obligation and Renewable Heat Incentive To increase and accelerate the use of renewable energy, including the use of woodfuel, the UK government has introduced several schemes including the: Renewables Obligation ( RO ) , which provides incentives for large-scale renewable electricity generation by requiring UK suppliers to source a proportion of their electricity from eligible renewable sources. Renewable Heat Incentive ( RHI ) , which pays commercial, industrial, public, not-for-profit, community and domestic generators of renewable heat. Check how to ensure that your fuel meets sustainability criteria under the RO and RHI schemes . Timber Standard for Heat and Electricity For woodfuel, the land criteria are outlined in the UK Timber Standard for Heat and Electricity . Compliance with the timber standard Woodfuel meets the timber standard if it originates from an independently verifiable legal and sustainable source and you have appropriate documentation to prove it. Currently, the timber standard draws upon the principles set under the Timber Procurement Policy requirements, but further explanation on the timber standard have been developed by Central Point of Expertise on Timber ( CPET ). CPET has developed three woodfuel guidance documents which set out the land criteria for those producing heat and electricity from woodfuel: woodfuel advice note consignment and mass balance approach risk based regional assessment: a checklist approach If you use woodfuel and already report on progress towards meeting the RO and RHI requirements, you need to comply with the ‘land criteria’ requirements in 2015. The practical guidance documents currently being developed will help you know how to comply with the upcoming requirements. Information on collecting evidence for woodfuel Evidence that the woodfuel originates from a legal and sustainable source can be provided through: the use of independent certification of the wood by any of the forest certification schemes that cover the sustainability requirements, together with the evidence of legality as required by the EU Timber Regulation the form of alternative/bespoke documentary evidence, including the use of the mass balance approach that provides sufficient assurance that the source of the wood is legal and sustainable Reporting against sustainability criteria Whilst CPET will provide advice on the timber standard, decisions regarding the administration of the RO and RHI schemes (including accreditation, Renewables Obligation Certificates (ROCs) issue and RHI payment, compliance with the sustainability criteria, etc) remain with Ofgem. For up to date information on the RO and RHI schemes, go to Ofgem website . The RHI Biomass Suppliers List , is a list of sustainable fuels that RHI participants can use to show they meet the criteria. You can find information from the government information centre for the use of biomass for energy in the UK. The Forestry Commission has an interactive web-based application that enables you to request the potentially available woodfuel resource in Great Britain by geographic region, type of woodfuel resource or various classes of resource. CPET has developed a guidance document for UK growers, woodland owners and managers on sustainable forest management, known as the CPET Growers Guide , on what they need to know about regarding the UK government Timber Procurement Policy; the EU Timber Regulation; and supplying woodfuel to the renewable energy and heat markets. Commitment to renewable sources The UK is legally committed to meeting 15% of the UK’s energy demand from renewable sources by 2020. Achieving this will help the UK meet its energy security and carbon reduction objectives . Under both the RHI and RO , if you are a renewable energy generator, you must demonstrate that the biomass used to generate renewable energy (including woodfuel) meets certain sustainability criteria regarding land use and greenhouse gas emissions. In the case of woodfuel the new sustainability / ‘land criteria’ specify that woodfuel must originate from legal and sustainable forest sources. Details of the RO ’s sustainable forest management criteria , for the use of feedstocks that are virgin wood or made from virgin wood were introduced in April 2014. Under the Renewable Heat Incentive, from Spring 2015, you have to ensure that your fuel meets sustainability criteria including a lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions target, and land criteria in line with those under the Renewables Obligation. RHI participants: use the Biomass Suppliers List , an online list of sustainable fuels, to comply with the criteria, or alternatively non-domestic participants will be able to self-report to Ofgem .

/government/news/fisheries-discard-ban-starts,"As of 1 January 2015 all fishermen targeting pelagic quota species must land all the fish they catch Fisheries discard ban starts  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs The latest guidance on the Pelagic landing obligation can be accessed on the Marine Management Organisation (MMO) website. Fishermen targeting pelagic quota species such as mackerel and herring will have to land all the quota fish they catch, helping bring an end to the wasteful practice of throwing fish back overboard. This obligation follows three years of hard-fought negotiations led by the UK government in Europe and is the first phase of the introduction of the wider ‘discard ban’. Previously fishermen had been required to discard some of their catch before they landed at ports, leading to up to a million tonnes being thrown back into European waters. While the practice was discouraged a ban was never formally agreed by Member States until the UK took the lead to secure significant reforms to the Common Fisheries Policy in Europe, including: A ban on discarding fish; a legally binding commitment to fishing at sustainable levels; and decentralised decision making, allowing Member States to agree the measures appropriate to their fisheries. The ban will first apply to pelagic species including blue whiting, boarfish, herring, horse mackerel, mackerel, Norway pout, sandeel and sprat. It will also include by-catch of quota species, such as cod and whiting, and any quota fish that are below the minimum landing size (MLS). Commenting on the start of the pelagic discard ban, Fisheries Minister George Eustice said: “The long fight to reform the broken Common Fisheries Policy has been won and today marks a significant milestone in our commitment to fish more sustainably by ending the shameful practice of discarding perfectly good fish. “But our work is not over. While it’s widely recognised pelagic fishing operations have relatively low discard rates we will continue to work with fishermen to help them adjust to the new reforms and make the transition as smooth as possible.” Looking ahead to the implementation of the demersal discard ban in January 2016, for fish such as cod and hake, the UK government has successfully resisted further reductions to the amount of days fishermen can spend at sea at this year’s EU Council. This will provide fishermen with the time they need to fish more selectively, help them avoid discarding and allow them to catch their full quotas. In addition we also secured a commitment from the European Commission to undertake research to improve quota flexibility, allowing fishermen to use quotas across different regions in light of the need for increased selectivity. We are also examining whether we can secure scientifically justified exemptions to allow fish to be returned to the sea where they have a high chance of survival and ‘de-minimis’ exemptions allowing a very low level of discarding where the cost of landing fish would be disproportionately expensive to fishermen. Research is also underway to identify viable uses for previously discarded fish, such as pot bait. The Marine Management Organisation’s (MMO) guidance for fishermen is available here . This outlines which fish come under the new landing obligation, what fishermen have to do with them on board, and which can be sold for human consumption. The European Commission’s guidance is available here A ban on the discarding of demersal fish (e.g. plaice, cod and hake) will be introduced between 2016 and 2019."
/guidance/environmental-claims-and-labels-guidance-for-businesses,"Information for businesses on mandatory and voluntary environmental claims and labelling schemes. Environmental claims and labels: guidance for businesses Manufacturing Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Environmental (or ‘green’) claims and labels enable businesses to highlight the environmental impact and qualities of products and services to help consumers make informed buying choices. Businesses can also enhance their reputation and demonstrate that they are acting responsibly to their consumers, business partners and regulators by providing credible information. Often these actions can steer the market towards products with a reduced environmental impact. Environmental claims and labels must be credible to consumers, clearly understood, and genuinely reflect a benefit to the environment. This guide provides links to a range of tools and resources for both mandatory and voluntary schemes to help business provide useful and accurate information, which is fair and not misleading. Green claims Defra’s green claims guidance (2011) provides advice to business for clear, accurate, relevant and substantiated environmental claims on products, services or in marketing and advertising. To complement the guidance, a summary ‘quick guide’ gives a brief overview of the essential aspects of a good environmental claim. Green claims guidance [InlineAttachment:1] Useful research that informed the guidance includes: Consumer understanding of environmental terms Assessment of green claims in marketing Assessment of green claims on products Some industry sector specific guides include: Green claims guidance in the decorative coatings sector Green claims guidance in the aerosol sector Best practice principles for environmental claims in the automotive sector (Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, Low Carbon Vehicle Partnership and ISBA) Green claims guidance for the cleaning products sector European energy label The mandatory European Energy Label requires producers of certain types of products (including refrigerators and freezers, washing machines, ovens and lamps) to show information that helps consumers compare energy efficiency between products. Guidance on the existing EU Framework Directive covering Energy Labelling and individual product measures is available. A [InlineAttachment:2] introduces requirements for advertisers. Defra is working in partnership with retailers to communicate the changes in the EU Energy Label to consumers. Communications material include a leaflet , posters, staff training material, internet banners and articles for in store and online magazines. If you wish to discuss the possibility of working in partnership with Defra please contact: efficient.products@defra.gsi.gov.uk [InlineAttachment:3] EU Ecolabel The EU Ecolabel scheme is a voluntary labelling scheme designed to help consumers identify products with the lowest environmental impact. Companies who believe that their products can meet the demanding Ecolabel standard must have this independently assessed and verified before being allowed to carry the distinctive EU Ecolabel Flower logo. Looking for the Ecolabel Flower logo makes it simple for consumers to have confidence in the reduced environmental impact of the product that they are buying. The EU Ecolabel scheme continues to grow year on year, in both the number and range of different products that it covers. Defra operates the EU Ecolabel in the UK and is keen to encourage this growth. More information on the products covered, the verification process and how to apply is available at the link below. the EU Ecolabel Scheme Food labelling There are a range of different voluntary labels related to the environmental impact of food. Labels often focus on single environmental issues like ‘organic’. But there is increasing interest in reducing the environmental impact of food across a range of environmental indicators to improve the sustainability of our food supply long term (see The Foresight project Global Food and Farming Futures report . The viability of food eco-labelling is being explored across Europe at various levels including the industry-led EU Sustainable Consumption and Production Food Round Table and through the Eu Ecolabel . Defra also has wider responsibilities on food labelling and food compositional standards where this does not relate to food safety or nutrition. False or misleading claims and labels The Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 requires all information to consumers to be fair and honest. If you believe that a claim is false or misleading, even after explanations from the retailer or manufacturer, you are entitled to take this up with the relevant enforcement body. Defra has no enforcement role in relation to misleading claims and labels, except for labelling schemes for which Defra itself is responsible, like the European Ecolabel. The bodies with a role in enforcing or regulating environmental claims, where you can go for advice or further information, are: your local authority Trading Standards Service, which enforces consumer protection legislation, can advise you on how to deal with complaints. You can contact them via the Citizens Advice consumer helpline on 03454 04 05 06 or visit their website , which provides clear, practical advice on consumer issues. In Northern Ireland enforcement responsibilities rest with the Trading Standards Service of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment. the Advertising Standards Authority , which deals with complaints about all advertisements and promotions and includes broadcast adverts, ensures standards are adhered to through the application of the advertising standards codes (CAP and BCAP codes). the Committee of Advertising Practice (CAP), which writes the non-broadcast Advertising Code, provides pre-publication advice via its CopyAdvice service . UK TV and radio adverts are pre-cleared through Clearcast and the Radio Advertising Clearance Centre . All 3 bodies will provide advice on how to get your green claims right. the National Measurement Office (NMO) in the UK is responsible for enforcement of eco-design of energy using products and European energy labels requirements. the Trading Standards Institute provides general guidance for business on how to comply with consumer protection legislation.

Common Fisheries Policy: implementation of the demersal landing obligation (discard ban) in England  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs We are seeking views on how we should implement the demersal landing obligation in England. The demersal landing obligation is a ban on the discarding of fish. This prevents fish being thrown back into the sea after being caught, except when subject to specific exemptions. Demersal fisheries are those in which fishermen primarily catch demersal species (fish which live and feed close to or on the seabed) such as cod, haddock, sole and plaice. In particular, we are seeking views on five keys areas of implementation including: phasing in of the landing obligation quota management access to exemptions catch management monitoring and enforcement The landing obligation for demersal fisheries will come into force gradually between 1 January 2016 and 1 January 2019. Implementation of the demersal landing obligation is one of several measures that will contribute towards achieving Good Environmental Status in our seas."

/government/news/free-flood-warnings-for-ee-mobile-customers,"A ground-breaking scheme to send free Environment Agency flood warnings to EE mobile phone users will be completed this week with more than 400,000 people registered around the country.  Free flood warnings for EE mobile customers  Environment Agency Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs EE customers registered in specific flood risk areas ranging from the North East to South London will receive a welcome telephone message from the Environment Agency’s Floodline Warnings Direct service between 9 and 12 November. The scheme is the first of its kind in England and follows successful roll-outs in other areas across the country in March and July this year. Following those pilots, less than 1% of people added to the service decided to opt-out. Since 2010, the Floodline Warnings Direct service has enabled the Environment Agency to automatically register and send warnings to 600,000 homes and business landline numbers, but this is the first time that flood warnings have been issued directly through a mobile phone provider. Jason Rees, EE’s Director of New Business, said: This new service clearly demonstrates the positive contribution that mobile technology makes to our everyday lives. The Floodline Warnings Direct service offers our customers a free and essential service. John Curtin, Executive Director of Flood Risk Management at the Environment Agency, said: We want to ensure that everyone has as much time as possible to prepare for flooding and by working with EE we’re now able to warn even more people about the risks. Flood warnings save lives and this ground-breaking initiative is another way to provide the public with vital time to protect their belongings and get themselves and their families out of harm’s way. Environment Minister, Rory Stewart, said: Flooding can devastate lives, homes and businesses. That’s why we are investing in flood protection at record levels, with an unprecedented six-year commitment of £2.3 billion to better protect an additional 300,000 homes by 2021. While nothing can take away the distress it can cause, it is important that everyone has access the right information, including the flood risk in their area, to give them peace of mind. This initiative from the Environment Agency is a great example of how we are making more data and technology available to help people plan and prepare for potential floods. The Environment Agency is now planning to work with other mobile providers to extend the warning service and reach more people directly. People can check their flood risk and register for free flood warnings by visiting the GOV.UK website or calling Floodline on 0345 988 1188."

/government/news/uk-government-to-host-the-25th-british-irish-council-summit-in-london,"Theresa Villiers, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, will host the 25th British-Irish Council summit in London on 27 November. UK government to host the 25th British-Irish Council summit in London  Northern Ireland Office Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Cabinet Office It is the fourth time the UK government has hosted a British-Irish Council ( BIC ) summit in London. On 10 April 1998 the UK and Irish governments signed the British-Irish Agreement following multi-party negotiations in Belfast. The British-Irish Council was established on 2 December 1999 when the British-Irish Agreement came into force. The Council includes the UK and Irish governments, the devolved administrations in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales and the Isle of Man government, government of Jersey and government of Guernsey. The British-Irish Council aims to ‘promote the harmonious and mutually beneficial development of the totality of relationships amongst the people of these islands’. It is a unique forum for members to exchange information, discuss, consult and reach agreement on issues of mutual interest. Summits take place twice each year and are a valuable forum to discuss issues including social policy, economic development and creative innovation. For example, at the most recent summit in Dublin in June 2015 , the Council considered a paper from the BIC Misuse of Substances Work Sector on the misuse of alcohol. It agreed continuing action across member administrations to protect the health and well-being of the wider public, especially children, from alcohol misuse. Find out more about the Council and previous summits. The London summit shows that the UK government sees the British-Irish Council as important in promoting positive, practical relationships across these islands. It will look at the work of the BIC Environment Work Sector and how each member administration protects our natural capital and resources including pollinators. Combining resources and knowledge across BIC member administrations will support valuable efficiency gains and avoid duplication. Each government is expected to commit to sharing technology and data exchange on natural capital. A workshop taking place in the next few months will continue this work. This agreement builds on other joint initiatives including shared Ireland-UK research vessel activity a cross-member early warning system for invasive non-native species supporting the Fishing for Litter initiative The Council will also discuss the economic situation in their respective areas. A communiqué providing an overview of the London summit will be published when it has taken place. View previous summit communiqués. Post-summit update After the summit, the British-Irish Council published a communiqué on issues that the Council discussed at the summit. Read an overview of the 27 November summit communiqué."

The funding secured by the UK government will be open for applications in England from 18 January next year, and will initially focus on supporting our commitment to fish at sustainable levels, as well as boosting the competitiveness of the fishing industry and aquaculture sector. Funding will be available to support port and harbour improvements and innovation in the processing sector which will provide huge benefits for coastal communities and businesses. Fishermen will also be supported as the discard ban takes effect with EMFF money available to part-fund the purchase or development of innovative gear for more selective fishing, or to help develop new markets for fish that were previously discarded. In addition Defra has asked Seafish to set up an industry expert panel, covering the fisheries chain in England, to advise on how EMFF funding can be used to best promote economic growth in the sector. Together this scheme is vital to help our industry adapt to the challenges of the future while supporting business. Commenting on the funding agreement, Marine and Fisheries Minister, George Eustice said: Fishermen in every part of the UK can receive support as they continue to develop their businesses and adapt to the sustainability commitments under the new Common Fisheries Policy and the phased introduction of the discard ban. These grants, combined with the flexibilities we secured will help our fishermen to adapt to the discard ban, will help us to achieve our ambitions of a profitable fishing industry by protecting our fish stocks for the long-term and safeguarding a healthy marine environment. Further information The UK strategy for the €243m European Maritime Fisheries Fund (EMFF) has now been agreed with the European Commission (EC) paving the way for the EMFF scheme to open on 18th January 2016. The European Maritime and Fisheries Fund 2014-2020 (EMFF) is designed to help fishermen across all Member States by financing projects including to support coastal communities and help them fish more sustainably. This UK scheme is administered separately in England by the Marine Management Organisation (MMO), in Scotland by Marine Scotland, in Wales by the Welsh Government and in Northern Ireland by the Department for Agriculture and Rural Development. The UK’s allocation of EMFF funding is distributed to each devolved nation based on factors including respective sizes of fleet, number of ports, sizes of industry and in light of previous historical allocations. When the scheme opens on 18th January 2016 the funding opportunities which are available will be published on the MMO website . A pelagic discard ban for mid-water species like mackerel and herring was introduced in January 2015. From 01 January 2016 fishermen targeting demersal species like haddock, sole and plaice will be subject to a discard ban. For more information see Fisheries Management: Landling Obligations ."

We fought hard to achieve the discard ban through our reforms to the Common Fisheries Policy ( CFP ) – it is one of the most important changes to fisheries management since the creation of the CFP and is crucial to making our fishing more sustainable. Together with careful quota management the discard ban will help us to achieve our shared ambitions of a profitable fishing industry by protecting our fish stocks for the future and safeguarding a healthy marine environment. The demersal ban follows the successful introduction of the pelagic landing obligation in January 2015, targeting mid-water species such as blue whiting, herring and mackerel. To support industry and help fishermen adapt, the ban will be gradually introduced in phases, and a number of flexibilities such as more freedom to bank and borrow quota and funding for new fishing gear will be available. To help fishermen adapt the government has secured: increased quotas from the European Commission – to take account of the fact that discarding should no longer be occurring. exemptions to the discard ban – based on the survivability of a species if returned to the sea once caught or the costs of handling undersized fish onshore. European Maritime and Fisheries Funding – those adapting to the discard ban will be able to part-fund the purchase or development of innovative gear for more selective fishing or to help develop new markets for fish that were previously discarded. Crucially we are delivering our manifesto commitment to support the smaller, inshore fleets and ensure sustainable stocks for the future. These vessels will receive more than 1,000 tonnes of uplift to support smaller scale fishermen as they adapt to the discard ban. The UK government fought hard to deliver a better deal for the UK fishing industry at December Council and secured significant quota increases for many species including North Sea cod and haddock, Channel plaice, Celtic Sea hake and Western Channel sole. Together with the uplift, this means positive and substantial quota increases for 2016. Further information The pelagic discard ban came into effect in January 2015. This has meant all fishermen targeting mid-water species, such as mackerel, have had to land all the fish they catch. The demersal discard ban will come into force on 1 January 2016. This has means fishermen targeting certain seabed species, such as haddock will have had to land all their catches of this species. Both the pelagic and demersal discard bans are putting an end to the million tonnes of fish that had previously been thrown back every year, dead, into European waters. The demersal landing obligation is being gradual phased in, a complete ban on the discarding of all quota species will be in place by 2019. The first 100 tonnes of any quota uplift received and 10% of any remaining uplift will be given to the inshore fleet; representing over 1,000 tonnes of uplift quota for 2016. The Marine Management Organisation ( MMO ) provides guidance for fishermen impacted by the demersal landing obligation. This outlines which fish come under the new landing obligation, what fishermen have to do with them on board, and which can be sold for human consumption. Guidance on the landing obligation can also be found on the European Commission’s website. For more information, contact Defra’s out of hours number on 0345 0518486."

/guidance/salmonella-get-your-fattening-turkeys-tested,"Find out when and how to take samples for testing, and what happens if one of your flocks tests positive. Salmonella: get your fattening turkeys tested  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs You must take samples for analysis and send them to a laboratory for testing if you keep more than 500 fattening turkeys (birds you keep to produce meat for human consumption) over a calendar year. This is part of the national control programme ( NCP ) for salmonella, which aims to control salmonella in poultry flocks across the EU. You must sample each of your flocks. A flock is a group of birds that shares the same house or range area. If you’re not sure if your birds are in one or more flocks, you can ask for advice from the Animal and Plant Health Agency ( APHA ) in England, Scotland or Wales, or the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development ( DARD ) in Northern Ireland. If you farm in England, Scotland and Wales you don’t have to sample your flocks if you are granted an exemption. You’ll get an exemption from APHA if you if you fatten 500 to 10,000 turkeys per calendar year and you only sell produce locally. ‘Selling locally’ means that you sell directly to consumers at farmers markets or to local retailers in any of the following: the county where your holding is the counties next to your holding’s county anywhere up to 30 miles from the borders of your holding’s county The rules on only selling locally are lifted in the fortnights leading up to Easter and Christmas. Get an exemption from testing You may be able to get an exemption from testing. Contact your local APHA office . They’ll tell you if you’re eligible to apply for an exemption and what you need to do. No exemption is available in Northern Ireland. When you don’t have to test a flock You don’t have to test a flock if you either: farm fewer than 500 birds only produce birds for private use (not for sale) only sell direct to consumers through farm gate sales or to local retailers that only supply consumers In England, Scotland or Wales if you farm between 500 and 10,000 turkeys and only supply locally you can apply to your local AHPA office for an annual exemption Register your flocks before you get them tested You must register each premises where you keep your flocks on one of the following: the Great Britain Poultry Register if you’re in England, Scotland or Wales the Northern Ireland Poultry Register if you farm in Northern Ireland When you must not sample Avoid taking samples during or shortly after giving your turkeys antimicrobials (antibiotics) that affect salmonella. APHA or DARD could declare your flock positive for salmonella if: inspectors see from the flock medicine book that you’ve given antibiotics the laboratory suspects that there may be disinfectant and antibiotics in your samples Contact one of the following for guidance on when to test after giving antibiotics: your vet (who will have prescribed the antibiotics) APHA if you farm in England, Scotland or Wales DARD if you farm in Northern Ireland Don’t collect samples unless you’re sure they’ll arrive at the laboratory and it can begin testing them within 96 hours (4 days) of sampling. Before you collect samples, you should check if your chosen laboratory can handle samples sent to them on a Thursday or a Friday. You’ll have to collect another set of samples if the laboratory is delayed in the post or they can’t start the tests within 96 hours. If the samples are not tested within 96 hours (4 days) you’ll have to take another set of samples. Paying for sampling equipment and tests You need to buy your own sampling equipment. Contact one of the following to find out where: your vet the government-approved laboratory you plan to send samples to your nearest APHA office in England, Scotland or Wales DARD in Northern Ireland You’ll also have to pay the laboratory charges for salmonella testing for your own samples and for routinely collected official samples. Contact DARD for details of fees in Northern Ireland. Official sampling at your premises In Northern Ireland, officials from DARD take samples. In England, Scotland and Wales, an APHA officer, an authorised vet or a SAI Global auditor (if your flock is in the Quality British Turkeys assurance scheme) take samples. They will all take samples once a year from at least one flock on 10% of all fattening holdings with capacity for 500 or more turkeys. Officials from DARD or APHA may also take samples in other situations: from all your flocks if one of them tested positive for Salmonella Enteritidis or Salmonella Typhimurium from all your flocks after one of your previous crop of flocks tested positive after a positive test for Salmonella Enteritidis or Salmonella Typhimurium at a hatchery has been traced forward to a flock on your holding from a hatchery from flocks where there’s no evidence of testing if they think a test result is inaccurate whenever APHA or DARD thinks it’s necessary When to take samples from your fattening flocks If your birds will be slaughtered at less than 101 days of age, then you must collect samples in the 3 weeks before slaughter unless they are organic turkeys. If your birds will be slaughtered at more than 100 days of age (or are younger but are organic turkeys), then you must collect samples in the 6 weeks before slaughter. You must send the result of these tests with the birds when you send them to slaughter, so allow enough time to get the results back from the laboratory when you’re planning when to collect your samples. What kinds of sample you need to provide You can provide samples from your flock in any of the following ways: 2 pairs of boot swabs one pair of boot swabs and 100g dust sample, or one hand-held dust swab one or more hand-held faecal swabs, but only if you can’t use boot swabs and you have fewer than 100 turkeys at the time of sampling How to sample your flock You’ll need to sample your flock in different ways depending on whether you’re taking a: boot swab sample dust sample faecal swab How to take a boot swab sample You should use: disposable plastic overboots 2 pairs of boot swabs - these must be absorbent enough to soak up moisture, and you can also use tubegauze ‘socks’ or premoistened commercial swabs tap water or bottled still water for moistening boot swabs - never use sparkling water or water treated on the farm with antibacterial agents or acids disposable plastic gloves sealable bags or sample pots packaging for sending your sample bags or pots to the laboratory Prepare to take samples Take samples in the existing litter - don’t put new bedding down. You should gather all the equipment you’re going to need before you go into the house, to prevent contamination before, during and after sampling. You should take special care to avoid contamination if you keep other animals (especially pigs or cattle) on your premises. To prevent disinfectant or sanitiser affecting your sample, you should: not use hand sanitiser on your plastic gloves only put on your plastic overboots after you’ve walked through disinfectant If you wear plastic overboots when you walk through disinfectant, you should put on a another pair afterwards to protect the boot swabs from the disinfectant. Sampling You should sample only the inside of the house, even if you have free-range turkeys. You should avoid sampling the areas just inside doors and pop holes, as they may have been contaminated by material from outdoors. You should take one or 2 pairs of boot swabs from each flock, depending on which combination of samples you plan to send. Moisten the boot swabs before you take samples. Pour the water inside them or shake the boot swabs in a container of water. If you’re only collecting boot swab samples, divide the house into 2 equal parts for sampling, and walk around in one pair of boot swabs in each part. If you’re using one pair of boot swabs and a hand-held dust swab, walk around the whole house in that pair of boot swabs. You should take at least 100 steps in each pair of boot swabs, making sure that you have swabbed every part of the house. Drag your feet on the floor to pick up as much material you can. If the house is divided into several pens, spend more time in the larger pens and less in the smaller pens. When you’ve finished sampling, carefully take off the boot swabs and turn them inside out so that all the faeces you’ve collected stays on them. Package them together to send to the laboratory. How to take a dust sample You should collect the plastic gloves, plastic bags and packaging that you’ll need before you go into the house. This is to prevent contamination before, during and after sampling. Put on new plastic gloves. Fully open out the hand-held dust swab. The total area of the swab must be at least 900 square centimetres (sq cm). Moisten the dust swab using tap water or bottled still water (never use sparkling water or water treated on the farm with antibacterial agents or acids). Swab at least 20 different places around the house including ledges, partitions, ventilation grills and anywhere else dust has settled. Make sure that both sides of the swab are completely covered with dust. Don’t take samples from feeding systems. Package the swab and dust into a sealable bag or pot to send to the laboratory. How to take faecal swabs You should collect the plastic gloves, plastic bags and packaging that you’ll need before you go into the house. This is to prevent contamination before, during and after sampling. Put on new plastic gloves. Fully open out the hand-held dust swab. The total area of the swab must be at least 900sq cm. Moisten the swab using tap water or bottled still water (never use sparkling water or water treated on the farm with antibacterial agents or acids) Rub the swab over several different areas where faeces has built up. You should thoroughly swab the pen area and any perches. Make sure that both sides of the swab are completely covered in faeces. Label samples On each sample submission form you must include: the date you took the sample your registration number or your County Parish Holding (CPH) number or DARD flock number the identification of the flock - house name or number and the month and year you moved the flock into that house the name and address of the flock’s holding the age of the flock the number of birds in the flock the contact details of the person sending the sample Send samples to a laboratory You should send your samples on the day you collect them. If you can’t send your samples on the day you collect them, you should refrigerate them at 2 to 8°C. You must not freeze samples. You should make sure the testing laboratory receives your samples within 48 hours of collection and that they can test them within 96 hours. If not you’ll have to take new samples. You must send your salmonella NCP samples to a UK approved laboratory. Find laboratories approved by: DARD in Northern Ireland the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs ( Defra ) in England and Wales the Scottish government Get your test results The laboratory usually sends the results to: the person who sent the sample the person the sampled flock is registered to APHA or DARD if the sample tests positive for salmonella If your samples test positive for salmonella You must declare in the Food Chain Information ( FCI ) documents accompanying the batch to slaughter: the NCP Salmonella test result, negative or positive the date the sample was taken from the flock This is a legal requirement and the birds may not be slaughtered if this information is not provided. APHA or DARD will take samples from every other flock on your holding to check for Salmonella Enteritidis and Salmonella Typhimurium if your samples test positive for salmonella. You’ll have to clean and disinfect the positive shed after you’ve sent the birds to slaughter. APHA or DARD will also return to take samples from your next crop of birds. If these tests are positive for Salmonella Enteritidis or Salmonella Typhimurium, APHA or DARD will place your holding under a movement restriction. This means that you’ll only be allowed to move certain elements, eg equipment, animals or animal products on to or off your holding with a licence from APHA or DARD . You’ll also have to clean and disinfect the restricted poultry sheds under their supervision each time you de-populate. Once you’re under movement restrictions, you can only restock your restricted sheds after tests come back negative. Speak to your vet for advice on how to control salmonella. You won’t have to pay for any samples or testing carried out by APHA or DARD because of a positive test result. Keep records Keep records for at least 2 years. APHA or DARD officials can check your records at any time, eg during a routine NCP visit or a visit after a positive test result. In Northern Ireland there may be different requirements please contact your local DARD office . Keep test records For each test you must record the: date you took the sample the flock identification, which is the flock’s house name or number, and the month and year the flock moved into the house type of sample, eg boot swab or dust sample age of the flock date you plan to have the flock slaughtered laboratory that tested the sample test result Keep movement records You need to record any movement of birds to or from your holding. For each movement record the: date of movement number of birds age of the birds house name or number, and the month and year the flock moved onto your holding address that the birds moved from (including the building name or number) address that the birds moved to (including the building name or number) Food chain information documents You must declare the flock’s most recent salmonella test result in the food chain information ( FCI ) documents that you send with the birds to slaughter if you market any meat from your birds as fresh meat. You don’t have to declare the most recent salmonella test if you heat treat all the meat from the flock before marketing it for human consumption. Declare salmonella test results You must declare all the NCP Salmonella test results, negative or positive, as well as the date the sample was taken from the flock in the Food Chain Information ( FCI ) documents accompanying the batch to slaughter. This is a legal requirement and the birds may not be slaughtered if this information is not provided. Further information Contact your nearest APHA or DARD office if you need more advice.

/guidance/timber-procurement-policy-tpp-prove-legality-and-sustainablity,"Comply with the TPP and check documentary evidence to show that timber is legal and sustainable: for government procurers and suppliers. Timber Procurement Policy (TPP): prove legality and sustainability  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs How to prove your timber comes from a legal and sustainable source Evidence of legality and sustainability can come in 2 forms: Category A Third party, independent forest certification schemes, referred to as ‘Category A’ evidence under the timber procurement policy, provide a way of defining sustainable forest management as well as verifying that a timber source meets the definition of sustainability. Government procurers and their suppliers should have documentary evidence to show the timber supplied is at a minimum from legal and sustainable sources. This evidence should include full chain of custody from the forest source(s) to the end user. Acceptable forest certification schemes provide this evidence of legal and/or sustainable timber. Suppliers and buyers must check evidence to verify its validity. !@1 Approved schemes include the 2 international certification schemes: Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) and Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC) . Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade ( FLEGT ) Voluntary Partnership Agreement ( VPA ) licensed timber is also accepted by the UK government as evidence of compliance with the TPP . Review of Category A certification schemes Forest certification schemes approved as ‘Category A evidence’ were reviewed (2014 to 2015) to ensure that they continue to provide evidence of compliance. Two schemes were put forward for the TPP Category A evidence certified scheme review: the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) and Programme for Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC) . An independent technical panel reviewed the evidence (communicating with the schemes throughout) before presenting their findings to the CPET reference board. Defra approved the results in 2015. For the schemes to meet the Category A criteria, it is mandatory to meet 100% of the legality criteria and at least 70% of the sustainability criteria. Defra announced that both schemes were 100% compliant with the Category A legality criteria and both were over 90% compliant with the sustainability criteria. To see the Category A Scheme Assessment Summary Report, click here . Both the Criteria for Evaluating Forest Certification Schemes (Cat A evidence) and the Methodology for reviews of timber certification schemes (Cat A evidence) were used to review the schemes. Category B Category B is all forms of credible evidence other than certification schemes that indicate that the forest source meets the UK government’s criteria for sustainability and legality. This type of evidence can vary greatly and is judged on a case-by-case basis. Government procurers and their suppliers: Use the Framework for evaluating category B evidence to help with the provision and assessment of Category B evidence. ‘Broken chain of custody’ is when you purchase timber and timber products from a supplier who is not directly certified but who claims their supply is. You may be able to show that it meets the requirements for legality and sustainability by following the steps outlined in the practical guides and framework document. It is important to understand that if you do have a break in the chain, and use credible Category B evidence to make the link between the certificate holder, your supplier and you, you can’t claim that certified products have been purchased. Any such claim would be a trademark infringement. Contact the relevant certification scheme for more information. Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade ( FLEGT ) Voluntary Partnership Agreement ( VPA ) licensed timber is also accepted by the UK government as evidence of compliance with the TPP . Meeting TPP requirements: guidance for woodland owners in England Timber traceable to a forest with a fully implemented forest management plan in line with the UK Forestry Standard (UKFS) requirements and guidelines meets the UK government’s Timber Procurement Policy. The Forestry Commission has guidance to woodland owners in England, and suppliers using wood from small English woodlands, to help them meet the requirements of government TPP . If your woodland is not certified through either FSC or PEFC UK (category A evidence), you may be able to demonstrate compliance with the UK Woodland Assurance Standard (UKWAS) . If a woodland is assessed by either FSC or PEFC against the UKWAS, timber can be sold as FSC and / or PEFC certified. Alternatively, you can meet the Category B evidence using the Forest source: checking category B evidence and if needed, the Forestry supply chain: check category B evidence guidance documents. International timber regulations EU Timber Regulation The EU Timber Regulation (EUTR) puts obligations on businesses who trade in timber and timber related products. The National Measurement and Regulation Office is the UK’s Competent Authority. Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade ( FLEGT ) One of the aims of the EU’s Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade ( FLEGT ) Action Plan is to reduce illegal logging. A Voluntary Partnership Agreement ( VPA ) is a legally binding trade agreement between the EU and a timber-producing country outside the EU. The purpose of a VPA is to: en­sure that timber and timber products exported to the EU come from legal sources help timber-exporting countries stop illegal logging by improving regulation and governance of the forest sector FLEGT VPA licensed timber is accepted by the UK government as evidence of compliance with the TPP . Once a VPA partner country licensing scheme has been established, licensed timber and wood-derived products arriving in the EU from that country should be accompanied by the appropriate FLEGT -licence which will be checked at import. Adequate supply chain controls need to be in place from the point of import to the point of delivery to Contracting Authorities to demonstrate that the material being delivered was FLEGT -licensed.

/guidance/bats-surveys-and-mitigation-for-development-projects,"Standing advice for local planning authorities to assess impacts of development on bats. Bats: surveys and mitigation for development projects Protected sites and species Wildlife and habitat conservation Natural England Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Survey reports and mitigation plans are required for development projects that could affect protected species, as part of getting planning permission or a mitigation licence. Surveys need to show whether protected species are present in the area or nearby, and how they use the site. Mitigation plans show how you’ll avoid, reduce or manage any negative effects to protected species. This is Natural England’s species standing advice for local planning authorities who need to assess planning applications that affect bats. This information can be used to decide what is needed for surveys and planning mitigation measures for bats. Ecologists need to decide which survey and mitigation methods are right for the project they’re working on. If this standing advice isn’t followed, they’ll have to include a statement with the planning application explaining why. Where this guide says ‘you’ it means the applicant or their ecologist. Get more detail on: bats protection and licences bat mitigation licence forms - you’ll have to follow this standing advice if you’re applying for a mitigation licence otherwise the licence may be refused construction near protected wildlife (for developers) how planning authorities can assess applications involving protected wildlife Decide if you need to survey Bats can be affected by construction work including: demolishing buildings extensions that block roof access wind turbines barn conversions removal of trees or hedgerows building or maintenance of roads Survey for bats if: records show that there are bat roosts in the development site or roosts in the area the area includes buildings or other structures that bats tend to use there are underground structures like abandoned mines, tunnels or cellars nearby there are trees with features that bats tend to use nearby distribution and historical records suggest they may be present a wind turbine of more than 250 kilowatts (kW) is proposed near to a site designated for bat populations located within an SSSI impact risk zone of a Special Area of Conservation (SAC) or site of special scientific interest (SSSI) a wind turbine of more than 250kW is proposed within 50m of features like woodland, hedgerows, rivers, lakes, caves, mines or structures that bats might use Buildings that bats use You’re more likely to find bats using a building (particularly during summer) because of certain features including that it: isn’t affected by artificial light levels is close to woodland or water was built a long time ago (particularly early 20th century or before), but bats use modern houses too has cracks or crevices has a roof warmed by the sun has an uneven roof covering with gaps (but isn’t too draughty) has entrances bats can fly into has a large roof area with clear flying spaces has large roof timbers with cracks, joints and holes has hanging tiles or wood cladding, especially on south-facing walls You’re less likely to find bats using a building (particularly during summer) if it: is in a heavily urbanised area with few green spaces or suitable habitat is an active industrial premises was built after the 1970s with few gaps is prefabricated with steel and sheet materials has a small or cluttered roof space (especially for long-eared bats) Underground sites that bats use Bats may hibernate underground in winter. You’re more likely to find bats using an underground roost if it: is close to woodland or water is large enough to have a stable temperature in winter is humid has many cracks and crevices (but this is less important for lesser and greater horseshoe bats) You’re less likely to find bats using an underground roost if it: is in a heavily urbanised area affected by artificial light is heavily disturbed, eg if people use it regularly is small and draughty has smooth surfaces (bats can’t grip on polished surfaces) Trees that bats use You’re more likely to find bats roosting in a tree if it: is in ancient woodland or parkland is large with a complex growth form has natural cavities - ash, beech and oak often have these has damage caused by rot, wind, woodpeckers or lightning, for example has loose bark You’re less likely to find bats roosting in a tree if it: is in a coniferous plantation with no mature trees that have splits, cracks or holes for bats to roost in is young and less than 20cm diameter at chest height, with a simple growth form and little damage Survey methods You can use any of the following methods to survey bats: visually inspect buildings or other structures inspect trees use bat detectors use netting and harp trapping use radio-tracking You can only use some methods at certain times of year - timings are explained in this guide. Read the bat surveys guidance by The Bat Conservation Trust. You’ll need a license for many methods if you’re surveying for bats. Visually inspect buildings or other structures You should: ask owners and neighbours if there’s a history of bats using the building inspect in the daytime using high-quality binoculars check for access points into the building inspect outside the building for bat droppings eg on the ground or stuck to walls inspect the inside of the building thoroughly - use endoscopes to inspect cavities if possible record signs of bats on a plan and compare them with a reference collection You should also: visit during summer or autumn if possible, although winter is acceptable explain in your report if it wasn’t possible to get to certain areas search roof areas for 1 to 2 hours (for a normal-sized house) search a large building for 1 day, or narrow down the search area using bat detectors Use bat detector (bat activity) surveys to confirm whether a bat roost is present if you can’t access the whole building or your building inspection shows evidence of bats. Visually inspect trees You should: inspect using high quality binoculars use endoscopes to inspect cavities if possible Bat detectors Use bat detectors if visual inspections suggest bats may be present. You should: survey over several visits at dawn or dusk, spread over several weeks between May and September only use hand-held detectors between dusk and dawn during the summer for buildings and trees, and during autumn for underground roosts survey buildings for up to 2 hours after sunset survey during the 90 minutes before sunrise and continue until 15 minutes after sunrise, after bats re-enter their roost in autumn, survey starting at sunset and continue for at least 1 1/2 hours to include the times of emerging for all bat species You can use automated detectors linked to data loggers as well as thermal and infra-red imaging. Netting and harp trapping You should: be suitably qualified to use this method only catch bats in flight as a last resort, eg if you need to identify a species Radio tracking You can use this method to find out what foraging areas bats from a particular roost use or if they have alternative roosts. You should discuss this method with Natural England before starting because it involves handling bats and you must have a licence. Survey effort needed You should assess how likely it is that concentrations of bats will be present at the site and how they’ll use it. Your survey should include checking whether bats: fly into or out of features likely to contain roosts, including swarming around underground structures like caves or mines travel through or near features likely to be used as commuting routes, eg hedgerows, tree lines or water courses are active in habitats where they’re likely to forage or feed, eg lakes and rivers The number of visits you’ll need to make will depend on the local conditions and how much risk the proposed work and the location will be for bats. The local planning authority will need to see the survey reports and mitigation plans to check they meet the standards required. You may be asked for more surveys if: habitats or other information (eg local records) show that it’s very likely that bats are present the bats’ use of the habitat varies between seasons your survey was done outside of the bats’ active season (May to September) your survey was done in unusual weather conditions like a particularly bad storm your planning or licence applications are based on poor data, unless you can show the area isn’t very important to bats You should assess how likely it is that concentrations of bats will be present at the site and how they’ll use it. Surveying buildings using bat activity surveys For this method: survey the entire building for signs like droppings visit during summer or autumn if possible - you can also look for evidence of bats in winter but you’ll need to follow this up with surveys in the active season explain in your report if it wasn’t possible to get to certain areas, and what should happen if bats are later found during development search roof areas for 1 to 2 hours (for a normal-sized house) search a large building for 1 day, or narrow down the search area using bat detectors Back up your searches with bat detector surveys or emergence counts to confirm whether a small, hard to detect roost is present, or if you can’t access the whole building. Searching caves, mines and other underground structures To survey these structures: survey for hibernating bats during January and February, depending on the weather, although extra care needs to be taken survey for swarming bats between August and October, continuing for up to 4 hours from dusk make 2 or 3 visits if you’re surveying in any month except January or February look for droppings or oil-staining around cracks and crevices check for signs of a maternity roost (where babies are born and raised until they’re independent) - if you find any, survey again in summer You can also use activity loggers. When and how to survey roosts Visual inspections can be done all year round. Bat activity surveys should be done in the bat active season, May to September. Spring (March to May) Roost type Inspect at this time Use bat detectors or emergence counts Building Yes, for historical signs and maybe bats Limited use, depending on weather Trees Yes, for historical signs and maybe bats Limited use, depending on weather Underground Yes, for historical signs Can use static detectors Bat active season (May to September) Roost type Inspect at this time Use bat detectors or emergence counts Building Yes, for signs and bats Yes Trees Yes, for signs and bats Yes Underground Yes, for signs Rarely useful Autumn (September to November) Roost type Inspect at this time Use bat detectors or emergence counts Building Yes, for signs and maybe bats Limited use, depending on weather Trees Yes, for historical signs Limited use, depending on weather Underground Yes, for signs and maybe bats Can use static detectors Winter (December to February) Roost type Inspect at this time Use bat detectors or emergence counts Building Yes, for signs and maybe hibernating bats Rarely useful Trees No, but best for signs after leaves have gone Rarely useful Underground Yes, for signs and hibernating bats Can use static detectors Influences on survey results Explain the implications if any of these factors affected your survey counts: weather an event that disturbed the bats, eg adverse weather event or extreme noise signs of bats were removed, eg if someone swept the floors to remove droppings Estimate population size class For a planning application that will need mitigation, provide an estimate of colony or population size per species of bat and include: how you’ve identified the species, including information from bat detectors counts of bats in the roost or activity, including dates the position of bats in the roost (eg clustered or dispersed) the pattern and amount of droppings, and how old they are whether you discovered food remains a map or plan of the site showing where you found bats or signs of them Assess the roost’s importance Assess the site’s importance per bat species using these factors, along with your survey data: droppings, eg significant quantities in piles in the roof void can suggest a maternity roost bat activity has been recorded there are access points in the building there are signs of cobwebs being removed by bats local records show bats could be present Give a description of any bat roosts or sites you find using these definitions: day roost - where individual bats, or small groups of males, rest or shelter in the day, but rarely on summer nights night roost - where bats rest or shelter at night, but rarely during the day feeding roost - where bats rest at night between feeding sessions, but rarely during the day hibernation roost - where bats are found during winter transitional or occasional roost - where bats gather at a temporary site before and after hibernation mating site - where males and females gather from late summer to early winter maternity roost - where babies are born and raised until they’re independent satellite roost - where breeding females roost close to the main nursery colony in the breeding season swarming site - where bats gather in large numbers from late summer to autumn Assess the impacts Provide an impact assessment showing what effect this development would have on bats if no mitigation were to take place. Include this with your planning or licence application. Consider the following potential impacts. Short-term impacts During development, bats can be disturbed by: increased human presence at the site increased noise changes to the area’s layout, temperature or humidity (these can affect commuting routes) Long-term impacts Changes to bat roosts can have long-term effects, for example: reduced roosting space or loss of roosts altogether changed entrance positions and sizes new entrances changed ventilation increased human activity external lighting near flight paths and commuting routes Wind turbines can harm bat populations when bats: fly into the turbine tower or rotor blades suffer from the changes in air pressure caused by the blades’ rotation, otherwise known as ‘barotrauma’ Scale of impacts Use the following tables to work out the scale of impacts on the bat populations per species - include this assessment with your planning application. You’ll need mitigation measures even for low impacts. Some bat species accept changes to their roosts better than others - take this into account in your planning. This is a general guide only and does not take into account species differences. Medium impacts in particular will depend on how carefully mitigation is designed and carried out and could range between high and low. Maternity roosts Impact Destruction High Fragmentation and isolation High Post-development interference High Partial destruction or modification Medium Temporary disturbance Low (if you do work out of breeding season) Major hibernation roosts Impact Destruction High Fragmentation and isolation High Post-development interference High Partial destruction or modification Medium Temporary disturbance Low (if you do work out of hibernation season) Minor hibernation roosts Impact Destruction High Fragmentation and isolation High Post-development interference Medium Partial destruction or modification Medium Modified management, eg changes to light, temperature or noise which will affect bats Medium Temporary disturbance Low (if you do work out of hibernation season) Mating roosts Impact Destruction Medium Fragmentation and isolation Medium Partial destruction or modification Medium Modified management, eg changes to light, temperature or noise which will affect bats Medium Post-development interference Low Temporary destruction followed by reinstatement Low Swarming roosts Impact Destruction High Fragmentation and isolation High Partial destruction or modification Medium Modified management, eg changes to light, temperature or noise which will affect bats Medium Post-development interference Low Temporary destruction Low Temporary destruction then reinstatement Low Night roosts, day roosts or feeding roosts Impact Destruction Medium Fragmentation and isolation Medium Partial destruction or modification Low Modified management, eg changes to light, temperature or noise which will affect bats Low Post-development interference Low Temporary destruction then reinstatement Low Temporary destruction Low Transitional roosts Impact Destruction Low Fragmentation and isolation Low Partial destruction or modification Low Post-development interference Low Temporary destruction Low Satellite roosts Impact Destruction Medium Fragmentation and isolation Medium Partial destruction or modification Medium Post-development interference Low Temporary destruction Low Species Risk to individual bats from wind turbines Risk to bat populations from wind turbines Noctule High High Leisler’s High High Nathusius’ pipistrelle High High Serotine Medium Medium Barbastelle Medium Medium Common pipistrelle Medium Low Soprano pipistrelle Medium Low Myotis species Low Low Long-eared bats Low Low Horseshoe bats Low Low Mitigation and compensation methods Address the potential impacts on bats by creating mitigation plans. Use the following approach. Aim to avoid negative effects, eg by redesigning the scheme. If this isn’t possible, use mitigation measures to reduce the impacts. Use compensation measures if there are still negative impacts for bats. Mitigation and compensation methods can include: changing the location of the work changing work methods or timing to avoid bats creating, restoring or improving roosts (and replacing any that will be damaged or removed) creating, restoring or improving habitats including foraging areas managing and maintaining habitats in the long term monitoring the roost status after the development limiting the use of wind turbines to particular times of day or year, or weather conditions (eg stopping blades in low winds) Bat boxes Don’t use bat boxes as a like-for-like replacement for existing roosts. Incorporate existing roosts into refurbished buildings For this method: make sure the roost is kept at the appropriate size and type for the species of bat put roost entrances back in their original positions Don’t use breathable roofing membranes (also called non-woven textiles) in a roof used by bats - use type 1F roofing felt with a hessian matrix instead. Create new roosts in buildings For this method: make sure the new roosts are appropriate for the species of bat, eg provide crevices for species that typically roost in them avoid trussed rafters, unless it creates a large roof void make sure the new roost will have an appropriate temperature avoid plastic roof linings (or use rough timber planks along the ridge beam) You can use large bat boxes in roofs. Roost entrances For horseshoe bats, create roost entrances they can fly through. For other species you can use smaller holes or slits for the bats to crawl through. Bat houses or barns Only use this method if it’s not possible to keep existing roosts. If you use this method: position the house as close as possible to the roost that will be lost and match it closely in size and aspect (direction it faces) position the replacement roost close to existing flight lines with the entrance close to the appropriate habitat, eg foraging and feeding habitat highlighted as important in the survey make sure the roost is designed with features appropriate to the species, including the temperature make sure the building will be safe from vandalism and bad weather make arrangements to keep the roost secure for the long term get planning permission if needed Discovering bats after development has started Stop all work that’s likely to be breaking the law if bats are found after development has started. Get expert help from a qualified and licensed ecologist. Then conduct a survey and develop mitigation plans. Management and site maintenance after development In your management plans, explain the maintenance that will be needed for any bat boxes or new roosts during the time you expect them to be used. Population monitoring Put a monitoring plan in place to assess the bat population after mitigation. Use the same counting methods you used before the development so you can compare population trends. Your monitoring methods should be in proportion to the level of risk to bats. For example, monitor the highest risk cases during high risk periods and include activity monitoring and casualty surveys where possible. Wind turbines Wind turbines can affect bats.

Structure of the agricultural industry: survey notes and guidance Farming business Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) is responsible for collecting and publishing a range of statistics about the structure of the farming industry in England and the UK. Land use and livestock data has many uses, from assisting with animal disease control processes to providing information which is used for management of the EU cereals markets. It is also used heavily by environmental policy makers who assess the impact of Common Agriculture Policy (CAP) reform on the agricultural industry and the landscape. Defra runs regular surveys of English farmers to collect the necessary information if it is not available from other sources. Administrative data, such as information from the cattle tracing system, is used instead of surveys where possible. This helps reduce the form-filling burden on farmers. June survey of agriculture and horticulture in England The June survey is a large annual survey that collects detailed information about land use, livestock numbers and the agricultural workforce in England. The survey is compulsory under the Agricultural Statistics Act 1979 and EU legislation. Similar information is collected by the appropriate authorities in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland allowing Defra to produce results for the UK. More information about how the June survey data is collected and analysed is available below. [InlineAttachment:1] Farms are classified using standard farm types (eg cereals, dairy, horticulture) so the impact of changes that might affect some types of farm more than others can be analysed. From 2010 these farm types are classified using an economic measure called standard outputs. Standard outputs measure the total value of the output of any one enterprise per head for livestock or per hectare for crops. More information on standard outputs is available below: [InlineAttachment:2] Completing the June survey of agriculture and horticulture If you are selected for the survey you will receive either an email request or a survey form in the post in late May or early June. More information about the survey is available below: [InlineAttachment:5] If you need help completing the survey our helpline is available from 9:00am to 4:30pm Monday to Friday. Please phone 01904 455284 or email surveys@defra.gsi.gov.uk . Users and uses of the June survey of agriculture and horticulture More information about who uses the information from the June survey of agriculture and horticulture and what they use it for is available below: [InlineAttachment:6] December pig survey This is a small sample survey of farms that keep pigs. It is used to estimate the size of the pig herd in England at 1 December each year. Information for cattle and sheep is taken from administrative systems and the Home Grown Cereals Authority collects information about cereals to give an overview of livestock numbers and crop areas in England at 1 December. EU farm structure survey There is an EU requirement for all member states to produce statistics about the structure of the agricultural industry every few years (eg 2010 and 2013). The main source of information is the June survey of agriculture and horticulture, but other detailed information is also required. In these years the June survey of agriculture and horticulture is extended to collect other information (eg on the workforce, farm practices or diversified activities), or additional surveys are run. Annual sheep and goat inventory There is an EU requirement to hold an annual inventory of sheep and goat keepers for livestock tracing and identification purposes. In England the inventory is held on 1 December each year. Sheep and goat keepers in England will receive either a paper form or an email request to complete their inventory in late November. The inventory can be completed online here . Since 2010 the information collected by the inventory is used to estimate the size of the English sheep flock at 1 December. More information about the use of the sheep and goat inventory for estimating sheep populations is available below: [InlineAttachment:4] Cattle populations The Cattle Tracing System (CTS), which records births, movements and deaths of cattle in Great Britain, is used to estimate the number of cattle on agricultural holdings on 1 June and 1 December each year.

This puts obligations on those who trade in timber and some timber products to help ensure that the wood has been legally sourced. Intelligence led the NMRO to assess the risk of plywood imported from China (but often originally sourced from Africa) and placed on the UK market. A risk based assessment led to 16 companies being investigated as part of this research exercise. A total of 13 products were purchased for testing against their described timber composition, of which nine did not match their declaration. Various sanctions will be applied to the companies in question, including the possibility of prosecution based on non-compliance with a notice of remedial action. The combined value of the imports of the companies in this project amounts to 10% of the plywood imported from China into the UK in the last year. Given the potential scale of non-compliance in this industry, the NMRO are likely to conduct further investigations in this product area in the future.

Family food statistics  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Family Food is an annual publication. It is the source of detailed statistical information on purchased quantities, expenditure and nutrient intakes derived from both household and eating out food and drink. Data is collected for a sample of households in the United Kingdom using self-reported diaries supported by till receipts of all purchases, including food eaten out, over a two week period. Where possible quantities are recorded in the diaries but otherwise estimated. Energy and nutrient intakes are calculated using standard nutrient composition data for each of some 500 types of food. Current estimates are based on data collected in the Family Food Module of the Living Costs and Food Survey and on adjusted data collected in the National Food Survey. Archived information Family Food was first published in 2002. Copies of the publications for 2002 to 2010 are available from the National Archive .

/government/statistics/family-food-open-data,"Initial open data release of National Food Survey data from 1974 to 2000, with supporting documentation. Family Food Open Data  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs The National Food Survey (NFS) was originally set up in 1940 to monitor the adequacy of the diet of urban working class households. It evolved into a continuous sampling enquiry into the domestic food consumption and expenditure of all private households, regardless of class. This open data release covers the years from 1974 to 2000, when the National Food Survey and Family Expenditure Surveys were merged into the Expenditure and Food Survey, and then became known as the Family Food Module of the Living Costs and Food Survey. The data that Defra is releasing now as Open Data are the only remaining data in electronic form. They were stored in Microsoft Access database format as five-year databases except for the last year, 2000. For each year there was a standard set of data tables: Diary data (the summarised records of each purchase of food for consumption in the home, taken from the National Food Survey log-books) Household data (the characteristics of the household such as location, occupation of Head of Household and Housewife (if present) etc., taken from the interviewer’s questionnaire) Mealsout data (record of all meals taken outside the home, taken from the log-books) Visitor data (record of all visitors to the home, taken from the questionnaire) Person data (record of each member of the household such as age, gender, occupation, taken from the questionnaire) Some changes have been made to make these suitable for release as Open Data. These are detailed in the document “Introduction to the National Food Survey” within the data release. In particular, the Person data has been withheld from open release for disclosure control purposes. All other data is available as separate tables in tab-separated-value text format for individual years. In addition, there are Nutrient Conversion Factor tables for each year (details in the other documentation) lookup tables to translate the short field codes in the original data tables into longer, more meaningful terms, taken from the database system. some additional tables and documentation to try to clarify meanings and changes in the usage of data fields, and some of the changes made to the data for disclosure control purposes. More details are in the “Introduction” file. Trying to find a balance between providing a rich and useful source of food purchasing data, and protecting the privacy of respondents throughout the years, has been one of the biggest challenges involved in releasing this data. We have consulted extensively with privacy experts, data protection specialists in Defra and a group of trusted external data testers in the run up to releasing this data. We have published a privacy impact assessment (see link above) which takes you through our process creating a data set which minimises privacy risks while hopefully still being useful to the public. The data is being released under the Open Government Licence v3.0 (OGL). For the avoidance of doubt, attempts to re-identify individuals from the openly licensed datasets is not an acceptable use of the data. Any instances of this brought to Defra’s attention will be directed to the Information Commissioner’s Office for investigation. Defra takes the privacy of respondents to Family Food surveys seriously. If you identify a privacy-related risk please let us know via familyfood@defra.gsi.gov.uk . Defra will remove the data from data.gov.uk and other online locations if a serious privacy breach is identified, and work to resolve it. The open data release can be found by clicking here . Another version of this data, without the disclosure control changes, is available from the United Kingdom Data Service under an End User Licence.

This is the equivalent of 10 Olympic swimming pools. Check also if you need  planning permission  or an  environmental permit . Whether you need one or both depends on the type of reservoir and its intended location. Register a reservoir You must register a reservoir with the Environment Agency if it holds or could hold 25,000 cubic metres or more of water above ground level. You don’t have to register a reservoir with a capacity of under 25,000 cubic metres of water above ground level. Whether you need to register your reservoir or not, you must follow Health and Safety Executive regulations and local council building regulations. What to register You’ll need to provide the: name of the reservoir grid reference - you can find this on the Ordnance Survey map name and address of the reservoir owners or operators date construction was completed height of dam (the level in relation to the surrounding ground levels) level of the top of the dam (the level relative to the ordnance datum) and top water level capacity of dam water surface area name and address of the panel engineers list of any certificates issued by panel engineers date when the next inspection is due You also need to state which type of reservoir you have: impounding (blocks the natural flow of a river or drainage from an area) non-impounding (filled by pumping water or by piped inflow of water) How to register To register, email reservoirs@environment-agency.gov.uk or write to: Reservoir Safety Team  Environment Agency  Manley House  Kestrel Way  Exeter  Devon  EX2 7LQ  You need to update the Environment Agency with any change to your reservoir. To access the register (for example to check your entry is correct), you’ll need to write, email or call the Environment Agency and ask for a copy of the register. When to appoint a panel engineer You must appoint a qualified civil engineer (known as a panel engineer) for any reservoir that holds or could hold 25,000 cubic metres or more of water above ground level. There are 3 types of panel engineer: construction engineer supervising engineer inspecting engineer If your reservoir is considered high risk, you’ll have to appoint a supervising engineer and an inspecting engineer. The exception to this if you plan any alterations to the reservoir - in this case, you need to appoint a construction engineer rather than a supervising engineer. If your reservoir isn’t high risk, you’ll only need to appoint a construction engineer if you plan to make any alterations to the reservoir. Construction engineer Appoint a construction engineer during the design, construction or modification of the reservoir. Supervising engineer Appoint a supervising engineer to supervise a built reservoir. The supervising engineer needs to produce a statement once a year of any observations they have made, for example of maintenance needs such as grass cutting. If your reservoir is considered high risk, you’ll need a supervising engineer appointed at all times unless the reservoir is being supervised by a construction engineer. Inspecting engineer Appoint an inspecting engineer to carry out an inspection at least once every 10 years. The inspecting engineer needs to: identify any safety measures that need to be carried out, and set a deadline certify that recommended safety measures have been carried out You must carry out any safety measures identified by your inspecting engineer within the deadline they set. How to appoint a panel engineer You can choose an engineer from either of the 2 main lists: all reservoirs panel  - supervising, inspecting, construction supervising panel - supervising only If you have a non-impounding reservoir, you can instead appoint an engineer from the non-impounding reservoirs engineer list or from the service reservoirs engineer list . Different arrangements apply in Scotland . Reservoir safety The following research about reservoir safety is on the British Dam Association’s website : Post-incident reporting system for UK dams February 2007 Engineering guide to emergency planning for UK reservoirs June 2006 Interim guide to quantitative risk assessment for UK reservoirs May 2006 Floods and reservoir safety (FEH/FSR) - revised guidance for panel engineers June 2004 Early detection of internal erosion - feasibility report November 2003 Vulnerability of UK dam embankments to increased direct rainfall on their surfaces January 2003 Climate change impacts on the safety of British reservoirs January 2002 Sedimentation in storage reservoirs February 2001 You can also get copies of reservoir research safety by emailing reservoirfm@defra.gsi.gov.uk . In February 2015, Defra announced that it has no plans to make further changes to the reservoir safety regulatory regime. The [InlineAttachment:1] explains this decision. Application process for panel engineers in England and Wales Defra appoints panel engineers under the Reservoirs Act 1975. If you want to apply or reapply to be a panel engineer in England and Wales, the application forms and guidance are available on the Institution of Civil Engineers’ ( ICE ) website . Apply in Scotland If you’re also applying to a panel in Scotland at the same time as England and Wales, you must complete an additional form . Prepare a reservoir flood plan and flood map You should produce an on-site reservoir flood plan for any type of reservoir. There’s a flood plan template you can use or you can create your own. Your plan needs to include details of how you’ll: seek to prevent the dam from failing contain and reduce the consequences of dam failure Local councils are responsible for co-ordinating off-site plans for reservoir flooding and ensuring communities are well prepared. Off-site plans set out what the emergency services will do to warn and protect people and property if a dam or reservoir were to fail. Reservoir flood maps Reservoir flood maps show the impact that an uncontrolled release of water could have if a dam or reservoir failed. You can consult the Environment Agency’s  reservoir flood map . Report an incident You may be held responsible for any damage or injury caused due to a sudden uncontrolled release of water. You must call the Environment Agency incident line if your reservoir is registered and there’s an incident that could result in damage or injury. Examples of incidents are: water going over the top of the dam (‘overtopping’) a leak slope instability cracks in the dam instrumentation readings that show abnormal movement in the dam material failure (for example landslip down an embankment of a dam) pollution If your reservoir is high risk, you should contact your supervising engineer. If that’s not possible, you should contact your inspecting engineer. Once the release of water is under control, you must give the Environment Agency a preliminary report of the incident. Your report must contain: the date and time of the incident the location of the reservoir any other facts you consider important (for example what you did, who you informed) Within one year of the incident, you must send the Environment Agency a final report using the  post-incident report form ."

/guidance/horse-passports-keep-buy-sell-move-or-treat-an-equine-animal,"Get a passport for an individual horse, pony, donkey, zebra or any other equine animal so you can keep, move, treat or trade it. Horse passports: keep, buy, sell, move or treat an equine animal  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Every horse you own must be identified through a horse passport - this applies to all equine animals, including: horses ponies donkeys zebras Any horse issued with a passport on or after 1 July 2009 must also have been implanted with a microchip. The horse passport identifies your animal through an implanted microchip and states whether it can be used for food at the end of its life. You must keep your horse passport up to date and tell your passport issuing organisation ( PIO ) of any changes. You need to provide your horse’s passport: if an enforcement officer, like a Trading Standards inspector, APHA (Animal and Plant Health Agency) inspector or police officer, asks to see it when you sell or give the animal to someone else when a vet examines or treats your animal You must keep a valid horse passport with your animal at all times. Semi-wild ponies Semi-wild ponies don’t need to be identified with a passport if they are in one of these derogation areas and aren’t under your control: Dartmoor Exmoor the New Forest Wicken Fen The derogation depends on both location and use. An animal doesn’t need a passport if it’s wild on the moor, not under your control. As soon as you saddle one or keep it on your farm (even if the farm is on a moor) it needs a passport. This applies even if your farm is in the derogation area. Get a horse passport You must get a horse passport for your horse before it reaches 12 months of age. If you don’t have a passport for horses older than this you must apply for one straight away. As part of the application process you’ll need to complete a markings diagram (also known as a silhouette diagram) - anyone can complete a markings diagram. You’ll also need to get a vet to: implant a microchip mark on the markings diagram where the microchip is confirm the horse’s silhouette, number, location, and any other details of the horse are correct in the application form Apply for a horse passport by contacting any PIO . If your horse is eligible for registration in a studbook then you can can apply for a passport from a studbook PIO such as a pedigree breed society. Contact the PIO for application and eligibility details. If your horse is eligible for registration with a studbook PIO in another EU member state then you may be able to get a passport from them instead . If you do so, you must register the passport with an appropriate UK studbook PIO within 30 days of receiving it. The PIO or breed society will tell you how to apply. You may have to wait up to 6 weeks to receive your passport. The cost varies between PIOs and fees may be higher for pedigree animals. European Union horse passports Passports issued by PIOs anywhere in the EU are valid in the UK. You must update your ownership details with a UK PIO if you buy or own a horse with an EU horse passport. You must register a horse with a passport from outside of the UK with an appropriate PIO in the UK within 30 days of importation. Find out more about importing or exporting a horse in the EU . Veterinary treatment You need a horse passport so your horse can be properly treated by a vet - your vet will need to see it before they can treat your horse. The vet needs to record medicines in the passport. If you don’t have the passport to hand then the vet will treat your horse as if it were intended for slaughter for human consumption. Not having the passport to hand restricts the sort of medicine that the animal can be given which could be more expensive. Signing out of the food chain You must make sure that you or the treating vet records any treatments that would permanently or temporarily exclude your horse from the human food chain. You or the treating vet make sure this is recorded in the relevant section of the horse’s passport. Buying and selling horses Owners must give the horse passport to the person buying the horse at the time of selling it to them. If you buy a horse you must contact the PIO within 30 days to update the ownership details. You should contact your local council’s trading standards for advice if you bought a horse and haven’t been given its passport. Riding and transporting horses If you’re transporting a horse, you must keep the horse passport with the horse at all times - this includes transporting it by trailer to competitions or for leisure riding. You must make sure the passport is immediately accessible in case emergency treatment by a vet is needed. If you’re riding a horse, you must be able to produce the horse passport without delay. Loaning a horse or keeping it at livery stables You must make sure your horse has its passport with it at all times, even if someone only looks after it temporarily. Make sure you give the passport to the person who loans or looks after your horse. If you borrow a horse you must have its passport. If you lend your horse or keep it at a livery yard where you’re not responsible for its day-to-day care, you must hand the passport over with the horse. Both the owner of the horse and, if different, the keeper who has primary responsibility for it, are breaking the law if the horse is kept without a passport. Lost passports A horse’s passport lasts the animal’s lifetime. If you lose your horse’s passport you must contact the PIO to request a duplicate passport. If you don’t know, or can’t find out, which PIO issued your horse’s original passport, you’ll need to apply to a PIO for a replacement passport. You must apply for duplicate or replacement passports from a UK PIO , and pedigree passports can be duplicated by an EU PIO if they comply with UK law. If you find your original passport after receiving a duplicate or replacement, you must send the original passport back to the PIO that issued it so it can be invalidated and destroyed. If the PIO is no longer in existence or is not a UK PIO , then send it to an appropriate UK PIO . All horses with a duplicate or replacement passport are automatically signed out of the food chain by the PIO . You’re breaking the law if you apply for a replacement or duplicate passport when the original isn’t lost. When your horse dies You must return the horse’s passport to the PIO that issued it so that it can invalidate or destroy the passport and the PIO can update its records. You must return the passport within 30 days of the horse’s death. You can ask the PIO to return your horse’s passport to you after it’s been invalidated, but the PIO doesn’t have to return it. Importing or exporting a horse from outside the EU You must contact the Animal and Plant Health Agency if you plan to import or export a horse from outside the EU . After importation is completed you must have the horse’s documents registered, upgraded or replaced by a UK PIO , or apply for a new passport within 30 days."

The Government has objectives to reduce these impacts, which includes the removal of the worst products from the market and promoting the sales of the most-efficient products. This document considers all these policies and interventions holistically as “product policies.” Defra has, on a regular basis, updated its evidence base, which covers a large number of domestic and non-domestic energy-using product groups. This document assesses the UK’s progress towards meeting its objectives to save CO2 through the implementation of effective product policy, and where future efforts should be focused. It sets out the Government’s current performance standards (also referred to as “Government Standards”) for energy-using products, projected from the present day to 2030.

Defra bites down on threats to sharks  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Sharks, skates and rays under threat of extinction should be given bespoke protection to help them recover faster, according to a new Government conservation plan launched today. The plan outlines how Defra will continue to work nationally and internationally to allow threatened stocks of sharks, skates and rays to replenish and to ensure that healthier stocks are fished sustainably. Richard Benyon, Natural Environment and Fisheries Minister, said: “The plan we have published today shows how committed we are to ensuring that fisheries for these species are managed sustainably, and to work both at home and abroad to make it happen. “The UK is leading the way internationally in trying to ensure a future for these species. We worked hard to protect vulnerable sharks, skates and rays at December’s European Fisheries Council and at the recent meeting of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna, and we will continue to push internationally for improvements wherever they’re needed.” Ali Hood, Director of Conservation for the Shark Trust, said: “The Shark Trust welcomes the Shark Conservation Plan as a major milestone in the UK’s efforts to deliver meaningful shark management and conservation. “Prompt implementation of the plan should greatly assist in delivering a sustainable future for UK sharks, however with shark populations regularly straddling the waters of multiple countries, the Trust encourages Defra to stand by its commitment to seek to influence other Member States and Regional Fisheries Management Organisations and make this plan truly effective.” The plan outlines how Defra will work to:- make all catches of sharks, skates and rays sustainable and prioritise action to protect and restore the species most at risk; improve our knowledge of shark, skate and ray fisheries through better data collection and scientific research and to use this information to improve fishery management; encourage international conservation bodies to adopt and promote effective conservation measures for sharks, skates and rays; and increase understanding, education and awareness of shark, skate and ray issues, working in partnership with the fishing industry and NGOs.

/government/news/new-plan-to-secure-future-of-fishing-communities-and-fleets,"The proposals have been developed with the aim of placing the whole English fleet onto a more sustainable footing. New plan to secure future of fishing communities and fleets  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Fishermen will have more control over how they operate and better opportunities to profit under plans to overhaul the way fishing quotas are managed in England, Fisheries Minister Richard Benyon announced today. Proposals to simplify the way quotas (the amount of fish that fishermen are entitled to catch) are managed would let the industry plan better for the future, putting more control in the hands of small-scale fishing fleets and fishing communities. Richard Benyon said: “Many fishermen are struggling to make a living, and the current system for managing quota stocks isn’t helping. It doesn’t give all English fishermen the freedom to fish for a share of the catch at the most profitable time, which is what they need.”  “We need a simple, straightforward system that gives fishermen more say, and gives the communities that have such strong links to their fishing fleets the opportunity to invest and be involved in the way their local fleet is managed. “I want to see a fishing industry that’s much more integrated, without arbitrary divisions mandated by Government. The industry needs to be freed to fish so that all fishermen, and the ports that rely on them, have the opportunity to thrive.” The proposals for community quota schemes focus on safeguarding small-scale fleets, enabling fishermen and other local businesses and organisations to work together to manage their overall quotas flexibly, along with increasing their ability to swap and purchase quotas and connect better with markets. These groups would also have a seat at the table in discussions with Government, regulators and industry. The plans also include: The allocation of more stable and predictable entitlements to fish across the whole English fleet, using Fixed Quota Allocations (FQA); safeguards to protect small-scale fishing rights and prevent concentration of rights in the large-scale fleet; and realigning fishing opportunities, moving some FQAs (including those associated with consistently unfished quota) to provide incentives for community quota schemes. The consultation also seeks initial views on the potential introduction of a rights-based management system for shellfish, beginning with brown crab and lobster. The consultation can be found at www.defra.gov.uk/consult/fisheries-1104/ . Notes Small-scale fishing fleets and communities with fishing heritage have the potential to deliver significant cultural, environmental and economic benefits, but the current arrangements make it difficult to maximise these benefits. A set of proposals for fisheries management reform in England have evolved from the Sustainable Access to Inshore Fisheries (SAIF) project, which was established to look at finding long term solutions to the difficulties facing the English under-10m fleet. The proposals have been developed in consultation with industry representatives, also drawing on the research and recommendations of the SAIF Advisory Group, with the aim of placing the whole English fleet onto a more sustainable footing."
/government/news/new-funding-for-local-flood-rescue-teams,"The money will be used to buy vital rescue equipment such as boats and emergency response training for their teams. New funding for local flood rescue teams  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs More than £820,000 has been given to 16 emergency and voluntary groups by Defra to buy rescue equipment and train them to deal with local flood emergencies. Announcing the new funding, Environment Minister Richard Benyon said: “In the event of a large-scale flood it is important that we can call upon manpower and equipment from a wide range of emergency services and voluntary groups. “Through this scheme we have already provided 35 grants to flood rescue teams to improve their flood rescue capabilities.  I am pleased that today we have been able to announce funding for a further 16 organisations to buy vital flood rescue equipment helping to improve England’s flood response.” Some of the organisations who will benefit from funding include: The Maritime Coastguard Agency, which has received £116,178 for equipment and training to set up 8 new rescue teams. The North Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service, which has received £76,861 to purchase a vehicle and training for a power boat rescue team. The South Worchester LifeSaving Club, which has received £72,000 to purchase equipment and training for a power boat rescue team. The grants are part of the £2.7 million Flood Rescue Grant Scheme to improve flood response in England and Wales. So far a total of 45 organisations have benefited from funding, including those announced today. All the equipment bought with the Defra funding will be added to the National Asset Register of flood rescue resources that emergency services across the country can call upon in the event of a major flood. Notes The grant funding announced today is the third and final set of allocations from the Flood Rescue Grant scheme. The first batch of funding was announced in November 2010, worth £919,000, and the second in March 2011, worth £816,000."

/government/news/reservoir-flood-maps-published,"Maps showing areas that could flood, in the unlikely event that a reservoir failed, now available. Reservoir flood maps published  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs To help authorities and emergency services plan for the risk of flooding in the unlikely event that a reservoir failed, maps showing areas that could flood have now been published online. Dam breach and flood modelling techniques were used to produce a national set of reservoir flood maps for England and Wales. The maps were created showing how far flood water would spread from the reservoir in a worst case scenario so that emergency services and councils have all the information they need to put plans in place to protect people. The maps are now available on the Environment Agency website. Environment Minister Richard Benyon said: “While the risk of a reservoir failure is extremely low the safety of the public must remain our top priority and where there is even a small risk we need to make sure that we are prepared. “These reservoir flood maps will help ensure that authorities and emergency services know what to do to reduce the possibility of water escaping from a reservoir and how to reduce damage and danger if a reservoir does fail.” The Welsh Minister for Environment Sustainability and Housing, Jane Davidson said: “Making the outline maps accessible on the Environment Agency’s web pages is important, not only to help raise the public’s awareness of wider flood risk information but also to spell out  what actions they should take in the unlikely event of a reservoir emergency.” This work has been carried out following recommendations from Sir Michael Pitt in his review into the flooding of 2007. Sir Michael recommended that outline reservoir flood maps should be made available to the public online in the context of wider flood risk information. The likelihood of reservoir flooding is much lower than other forms of flooding. Current reservoir regulation, which has been further enhanced by the Flood and Water Management Act, aims to make sure that all reservoirs are properly maintained and monitored in order to detect and repair any problem. Notes The maps can be viewed at www.environment-agency.gov.uk/homeandleisure/floods/124783.aspx . The maps are available through the “What’s in your back yard” facility. They will allow members of the public to view maps for large raised reservoirs in England and Wales. Defra has provided £1.25 million to enable local authorities and other organisations to prepare emergency plans including informing residents if they live in reservoir flood zones. Funding for future years has been provided for within the local government formula grant settlement. The outline reservoir flood maps do not give any information about the likelihood of reservoir failure, the depth and speed of the flood waters, or the length of time it would take for the flood waters to reach any location.  Even in a worst case scenario many areas shown as possibly being at risk of reservoir flooding would be expected to receive no more than a few centimetres of flood water. In England and Wales, the Environment Agency has a regulatory role for reservoir safety, under the Reservoirs Act 1975. It ensures that reservoirs are regularly inspected and essential safety works are carried out. The Environment Agency has the power to prosecute reservoir owners for failure to carry out essential safety works, and where emergency works are required, it has the power to carry out these works itself."
/government/news/alternative-pet-remedies-government-clampdown,"Alternative remedies which could be dangerous to pets are being targeted by the Government in a major drive to improve animal health and welfare. Alternative pet remedies: Government clampdown  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Some herbal and homeopathic products are claiming medicinal benefits without scientific proof, meaning they may not properly treat or prevent serious diseases, leaving pets at risk. The Veterinary Medicines Directorate’s (VMD) Director of Operations, John FitzGerald, said: “Some of these products are claiming to be effective and safe when no scientific evidence has been presented to us to show they are. “Animal owners have a right to know if a product does what it claims. The products claim to treat diseases which can cause serious welfare problems and in some circumstances kill animals if not properly treated. So in some cases owners are giving remedies to their pets which don’t treat the problem.” A number of unauthorised products are being targeted, including: Homeopathic ‘nosodes’ - which are derived from diseased animal tissues, in the belief they act as a vaccination to prevent infection. Animal food supplements - known as neutraceuticals, which claim to treat diseases or bring extra health benefits such as improved mental ability in pet animals. Herbal liquids, powders and pellets - sold as herbal wormers - claiming to irritate and repel parasitic worms from the guts of horses, livestock, and pets. From now on, the VMD will be contacting manufacturers to ensure that they demonstrate the products are safe and provide the benefits which they claim to.  If this is not the case the manufacturers will be required to re-brand the products to make it clear they are not medicinal. Supporting the action, British Veterinary Association President Harvey Locke said:  “As veterinary surgeons we rely on the use of safe, effective and quality medicines for the health and welfare of animals under our care - and there must always be sound scientific evidence to back up medicinal claims made by the manufacturer of any product. “Some of these unauthorised products may at the least be ineffective and at worst could cause harm because serious life-threatening diseases may go undiagnosed. We would urge animal owners always to check with their veterinary surgeon before giving any remedy or supplement to their pet.” Notes The VMD is the body responsible for the authorisation of veterinary medicinal products in the United Kingdom. The EU definition of a veterinary medicinal product is: “any substance or combination of substances presented as having properties for treating or preventing disease in animals; or any substance or combination of substances which may be used in, or administered to, animals with a view either to restoring, correcting or modifying physiological functions by exerting a pharmacological, immunological or metabolic action, or to making a medical diagnosis”. Products meeting this definition require a Marketing Authorisation before they can be sold in the UK and it is the role of the VMD to assess manufacturers’ product information for quality, safety and efficacy prior to granting a MA. Herbal medicines for humans are monitored and regulated separately, whereas herbals for animals are regulated under the same criteria as normal veterinary medicines.  The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency announced that by April 2011 all manufactured herbal medicines for humans will be required to have either a traditional herbal registration or a product licence. Anyone with concerns about the sale of unauthorised products should contact the VMD at www.vmd.gov.uk or 01932 336911."

/government/news/new-funding-for-local-flood-rescue-teams--2,"Rescue services in England and Wales are to receive funding to help equip and train local flood rescue teams. New funding for local flood rescue teams  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs The Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs (Defra) has announced a total of £2million to improve flood rescue capability. Grants totalling approximately £650,000 have been awarded from the fund today. The money will help local flood resilience teams’ efforts to raise money to buy everything from boats and flood barriers to training sessions for flood rescue volunteers. Announcing the new funding, Environment Secretary Caroline Spelman said: “We have learnt from the floods we have experienced in recent years that the emergency response is most effective when public, private and voluntary groups work well together - and we saw this week in Cornwall how important it is for these groups to have well rehearsed plans in place. “The money we’re announcing today will help local flood rescue teams - such as fire and rescue services, police and the RNLI - to buy extra equipment or training which will be used in a rescue situation when the need arises.” All the equipment bought with the new money will be added to the National Asset Register of emergency resources that others can call upon in the event of a major flood. Applications for the remaining funding can be made to Defra until 31 January 2011. The successful applicants were announced at a flood emergency response exercise at Hawley Lake in Hampshire, which involved fire and rescue crews, police, Army personnel and the Environment Agency. The event marks the launch of preparations for Exercise Watermark, a week-long national flood emergency exercise which takes place in March next year involving all Government departments. Caroline Spelman added: “Exercise Watermark stems from Sir Michael Pitt’s recommendations following the 2007 floods which caused so much devastation and heartache. The government is committed to implementing those recommendations and working with communities to minimise the risks to people’s lives and their livelihoods. “The events taking place today and next spring when we carry out more emergency drills will help us to be as prepared as we can be for the dangers caused by floods.” Applications for the remaining funding should be made to Defra by 31 January 2011. For further information on how to apply please go to archive.defra.gov.uk/environment/flooding/planning/frne.htm Notes The successful applicants for flood rescue funding are: Humberside Fire and Rescue Service (FRS) will receive £125,000 to provide four Powered Boat Teams for national use.

/government/news/love-your-electricals,"The theme was chosen following research conducted by Recycle Now, the national recycling campaign.  Love your electricals!  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Recycle Week kicks off on Monday and this year we are all encouraged to think about parting with our used electrical goods so they can find a new home; hence the theme - ‘love your electricals’.  They examined people’s relationships with the small electrical items that make up so much of our daily lives - such as mobile telephones, laptops and MP3 players. They found that many of us keep such items when we no longer have a use for them, whether they are broken or have been replaced with the latest model.   Respondents admitted keeping their unused electrical items for both sentimental and practical reasons: 40% feel too sad to part with an item they no longer use 41% hoped the item might come in handy some day, or that they might be able to pass them on to someone 23% feel that small electrical items seem too valuable just to throw away 29% hang on to them because they are not sure what to do with them Thankfully, help is now at hand to help us ‘let go’. In support of Recycle Week, The British Heart Foundation is offering to take unused or unwanted small electricals that are still in working order, and sell them on to benefit the charity (once they have been safety tested). With its network of over 90 Furniture & Electrical Stores, this should be welcome news to the 37% of us who say we would feel better if we could donate or recycle our unused small electrical goods. Mike Lucas, Director of Retail at the British Heart Foundation (BHF) says: “Recycle Week is a new and exciting partnership for the BHF raising vital funds in the fight against heart disease - the nation’s biggest killer. We’re appealing for those unwanted toasters and kettles lying around in your loft, as the sale of just one item can go towards funding vital treatment for a heart patient.  “Many people don’t know what to do with their working items once they’ve been replaced with newer versions, but by donating them in Recycle Week, they could become a life saver.” Environment Secretary, Caroline Spelman supports the scheme: “We’ve all got electrical items such as old CD players around our homes that are often not used or are replaced when the latest gadget comes along. These can be donated to charities and groups that can use them, or if broken, can be recycled so they can be made into products of the future.” So, this weekend, why not dig out your old and unused small electrical and take them to your local recycling centre.  Or, if they still work, take them to your nearest British Heart Foundation store.

/government/news/research-on-green-claims,"Defra has today published research on claims about environmental performance on products and packaging.  Research on green claims  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs The research examined the number and types of claims being made. This will be used to inform Defra’s work to update the Green Claims Code. Environment Minister Lord Henley said: “Marketing and packaging increasingly tell us about the environmental credentials of everything from washing powder to cars. “While it’s good news that manufacturers are trying to reduce the environmental impact of their products, as consumers we need to know that the claims being made are not misleading, otherwise we will stop using our purchasing power to do the right thing. “This research assesses which green claims are currently made and I am looking forward to the findings being used to help Defra to update the Green Claims Code.” This is the latest in a series of projects commissioned to contribute to the update of the green claims code.  Previous projects examined green claims in marketing and consumer understanding of green claims and specific terminology.

/government/news/defra-helps-companies-build-confidence-in-green-claims,"Defra today published new Green Claims Guidance to help companies describe the environmental credentials of their products in a way that people find easier to understand. Defra helps companies build confidence in green claims  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs The Guidance is designed to help consumers make more informed judgements about what they buy, prevent misleading claims and encourage the development of greener products. As people look to purchase more products promising less environmental impact they often have to face a confusing array of advertising labels. More products enter the market every day and they tend to bring a new crop of environmental terms along with them - while recycling is well understood newer phrases like ‘negative carbon footprint’ can seem more confusing. Research suggests that consumers find it difficult to know which products are better for the environment. At the same time, businesses faced with a crowded marketplace can find it difficult to communicate about genuine improvements they have made to their products. Environment Minister Lord Henley said: “Sales of ‘green’ goods contribute billions of pounds towards the economy while helping to reduce our impact on the environment. If people are making the effort to buy green it is only right that we try to make the process as easy as possible. Our guide will make things easier for both business and consumer - helping restore public faith in environmental advertising and acting as a resource for companies developing more sustainable products.” Corporate Sustainability Manager for Marks & Spencer, Rowland Hill said: “We welcome the new Green Claims Guidance which will help companies to market products and services that are more sustainable. It’s in everybody’s best interest that sustainable products are legitimately promoted to replace less sustainable alternatives. Marks & Spencer launched sustainability targets back in 2007 to help our customers live more sustainably and make informed choices about what they buy.” Environment Manager for The Co-operative Food, Iain Ferguson said: “We welcome Defra’s updated Guidance which is designed to make products’ environmental claims more robust for the benefit of customers while keeping abreast of a fast-developing market. We are delighted to have assisted in this review process, having applied the Guidance since it was first published in 2003.” Defra’s new updated Guidance is informed by a suite of research and recommends that companies use clear language when making environmental claims. Findings indicated that while participants were familiar with a range of different terms, some phrases like ‘energy efficient’ were better understood than others such as ‘carbon negative’. Businesses are encouraged to follow three key ‘steps’ in order to build consumer confidence in the environmental attributes of their products: Ensure the content of the claim is relevant and reflects a genuine benefit to the environment; Present the claim clearly and accurately; and Ensure the claim can be substantiated. The Guidance is designed as a proactive toolkit - using principles and practical examples to help businesses get their green claims right. Read the full Guidance or the shorter ‘quick guide’ .  Notes The Co-operative’s annual ethical consumerism report shows spending on ‘green’ products in Britain increased from £1.4bn 1999 to £7bn in 2009. The Guidance is an update to Defra’s previous Green Claims - Practical Guidance (2003) and Green Claims Code (2000) reflecting changes in the market since that time. The Guidance went through public consultation in 2010 and is widely supported by industry as important to help provide clarity in the market. The updated Guidance took into consideration the consultation responses and aimed to make the document more user-friendly with clearer examples to illustrate the principles. It also draws on wider research commissioned by Defra, including: Consumer understanding of green terms (Brook Lyndhurst and Icaro Consulting, 2011) An assessment of green claims in marketing (Brook Lyndhurst, Icaro Consulting and AAI+Friends, 2010) An assessment of green claims on products (Five Winds International, 2010) The Guidance was updated with assistance of a steering group that included the Advertising Standards Authority, Advertising Association, Department of Business Innovation and Skills, British Retail Consortium, CBI, Chartered Institute of Marketing (CIM), Chartered institute of Public Relations (CIPR), COI, Consumer Focus, DECC, Department for Transport, Forum for the Future, Institute for Practitioners in Advertising (IPA), ISBA, Office of Fair Trading, Sustainable Development Commission."

/government/news/trials-show-fishermen-can-drastically-reduce-discards,"The UK will work to secure additional quota in this year's negotiations on total allowable catches and quotas so that trials can be expanded. Trials show fishermen can drastically reduce discards  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs The dreadful waste of thousands of tonnes of dead fish being thrown back into the sea every day could be stopped if fishermen are required to count all the fish they catch as part of their quota, pioneering UK trials have shown. Published today, the report shows that fishermen taking part in the UK’s Catch Quota trials have stopped throwing away fish. Its findings add weight to the UK Government’s calls for drastic reform of Europe’s broken and wasteful Common Fisheries Policy. Fisheries Minister Richard Benyon said: “At the moment European policy allows fishermen to catch an unlimited amount of fish, provided they don’t bring more than their quota back to port. This gives them no choice but to throw thousands of tonnes of perfectly edible fish back into the sea every day. This is a disgrace, it’s no good for the future of our fish stocks and no good for fishermen trying to make a living. “The UK Government is clear that the Common Fisheries policy is broken and needs drastic reform. We came forward with a practical solution of counting what they catch not what they land, and now we’ve shown that it works. “This evidence will be invaluable as we continue to fight for radical reform of this outdated and wasteful European policy. The UK is leading the way and the rest of Europe needs to step up and follow our example.” Under current European Commission rules fishing boats are given quotas for landing different types of fish in a specific area. If they go over their allowance they can continue to fish as long as they don’t land any more of that quota fish - leading to perfectly edible fish being thrown overboard. Catch Quota trials began in the UK in 2010 and were expanded in early 2011 to include English fishermen catching West Channel sole as well as cod in the North Sea. Boats taking part have to land all of the fish of these species that they catch so they all count against their quota. Once the quota is used up they have to stop fishing completely. Onboard monitoring, including CCTV cameras, checks whether they are following the rules. Trial manager Julian Roberts, from the Marine Management Organisation who manage the trial on behalf of Defra, said: “Fishermen in the trial are demonstrating that they can avoid catching small, low value fish which might otherwise be discarded. “They tend to be more selective in choosing their fishing grounds and introducing better gear that targets only larger fish. This can only be good news for the fishing industry’s sustainable future.” The report, published today by the Marine Management Organisation, shows that fishermen involved in the trials are discarding less than one per cent of the cod and sole they catch. This is far less than the 21 per cent average across the EU for North Sea cod and the estimated nine per cent of sole discarded by all English and Welsh vessels in the Western Channel. Catches of undersized fish in the trial are also low, suggesting that boats are fishing more selectively. The UK will work to secure additional quota in this year’s negotiations on total allowable catches and quotas so that trials can be expanded to enable more vessels to participate and to test the system in other fisheries. This evidence will be used as the UK pushes to improve proposals to reform the Common Fisheries Policy put forward by the European Commission earlier this year. The UK is fighting for a more transparent and decentralised approach where fishermen themselves help solve problems such as discards, rather than one-size-fits-all regulation.

Successful trial dramatically reduces ‘discards’  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Fishermen have radically cut the amount of fish they discard following the success of the Government’s ‘Catch Quota’ trials, Fisheries Minister, Richard Benyon has announced today. Last year’s ‘Catch Quota’ trial was introduced to reduce discards of North Sea cod and for sole in the Western Channel and results show that those participating in the trail have been successful in reducing discards of both stocks to just 0.2%. In 2010, the average discard rates were 38% for North Sea cod trawlers and 28% for Western Channel sole beam trawlers. Commenting on the trials Fisheries Minister Richard Benyon said: “This is a tremendous result and I applaud the contribution which fishermen have made to this success. “I am very pleased that more fishermen have joined the 2012 catch quota scheme and I believe that we can build on the success of last year.  “Discards are a product of the broken Common Fisheries Policy and I will continue to press the EU until we eliminate this wasteful practice. “I want to continue to work with industry to develop innovative solutions, such as the Catch Quota scheme, which reduce unwanted catches and work towards the elimination of discards. In doing so I want to ensure the fishing industry remains viable and profitable.” The UK is testing Catch Quota management which counts what is caught rather than what is landed at port.  It is a key tool in reducing the wasteful practice of discards while maintaining a profitable fishing industry. The scheme is being carried out on behalf of Defra by the Marine Management Organisation (MMO). James Cross, Chief Executive of the MMO said: “I’m really proud of our work and the contribution from the fishing industry in helping to develop innovative solutions to challenges facing both fishermen and the marine environment. “The fantastic results of the trial demonstrate how beneficial it is for us to work together in looking at alternative ways of managing fisheries. “We look forward to continuing this work in 2012-13 and achieving a more sustainable future for the industry.” Discards represent a waste of natural resources and one of the Government’s priorities for reforming the broken Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) is to ensure the practice is eliminated. The UK Government hopes that a reformed CFP can bring an end to discards and believes the best way to do this is through an approach that addresses the problems which are specific to each fishery.  Discarding perfectly good fish can happen for many different reasons. For example, when fishermen have hit their quota or when they catch a fish they have no quota for. The trial has operated on a voluntary basis and fishermen who join the scheme have to account for everything they take out of the sea and land everything they catch, regardless of size, with CCTV used to check that they are sticking to the rules. Participating fishermen have also drastically reduced discards of undersized fish of all species to between 0 and 3% of their total catch indicating the effectiveness of selectivity methods being used by the participating fishermen.

/government/consultations/amendment-to-the-uk-plan-for-shipments-of-waste-to-allow-the-export-of-dredged-sediments-from-the-river-tyne-for-disposal,"Defra consulted on a proposed amendment to the UK Plan for Shipments of Waste (""the UK Plan"") to allow the export of contaminated sediments from the River Tyne for disposal. Amendment to the UK Plan for Shipments of Waste to allow the export of dredged sediments from the River Tyne for disposal  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Defra consulted on a proposed amendment to the UK Plan for Shipments of Waste (“the UK Plan”) to allow the export of contaminated sediments from the River Tyne for disposal. The UK has a policy of prohibiting, with limited exceptions, the shipment of waste to or from the UK for disposal. This policy is contained in the UK Plan. The Plan underpins the principles of self-sufficiency and proximity in waste disposal that are set out in EU waste legislation. The Plan can be viewed on the web at: www.doeni.gov.uk/niea/waste-shipments.pdf . Under the UK Plan, exceptions to the general prohibition on exports for disposal can currently be made, but in the case of non-hazardous waste, the only exception provided for is for small quantities for trial runs - to assess a new technology for example. Thus an amendment to the UK Plan would be needed to allow contaminated river sediments that are non-hazardous waste to be exported for disposal. The River Tyne Sediment Steering Group have asked Defra to expedite this request for an amendment to the UK Plan because the Group is concerned that there should be a proper contingency plan in place as soon as possible for the management of the dredgings, and to allow any dredging operations to commence as soon as possible in support of planned development of the River Tyne basin. Given that some informal consultations have already been undertaken with industry and with affected parties, comments on this proposed amendment and consequential changes to the UK Plan were requested by close on 10 February 2012."
/government/consultations/european-marine-and-fisheries-fund-emff,"This consultation sought views on proposals on the European Commission’s proposals for the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund.    The European… European Marine and Fisheries Fund (EMFF)  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs This consultation sought views on proposals on the European Commission’s proposals for the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund. The European Commission published their proposals for the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) that will replace the European Fisheries Fund (EFF) from 1 January 2014 until 31 December 2020. The EMFF is structured around four pillars: Smart, Green Fisheries; intended to help address discards, support fisheries which are less damaging to the marine environment, support innovation value added, and build resilience to external factors; Smart, Green Aquaculture; which aims to help aquaculture businesses achieve economic viability and competitiveness; Sustainable Development of Fisheries Areas; targeted at reversing the decline of many coastal and inland communities dependent on fishing; and Integrated Maritime Policy (IMP); which includes a number of cross cutting measures including maritime surveillance, data sharing, Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) and Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM). The funding under this pillar will be held by the Commission and centrally distributed. The proposals for the EMFF aim at achieving the objectives of the reformed Common Fisheries Policy and of the IMP (the major difference between the EMFF and EFF is the inclusion of the IMP). In addition to this process, we will also meet directly with groups of stakeholders to gather their views on the Commission proposals, and will continue to do this as the negotiations develop.

/government/consultations/proposed-legislative-reform-order-to-amend-the-veterinary-surgeons-act-1966,"The Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons (RCVS) governs the veterinary profession through its Council and system of committees. Proposed Legislative Reform Order to amend the Veterinary Surgeons Act 1966  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Summary The Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons (RCVS) governs the veterinary profession through its Council and system of committees. This includes the two statutory committees that deal with disciplinary proceedings - the Preliminary Investigation Committee (PIC) and Disciplinary Committee (DC). RCVS Council both sets the standards for the profession and, through these statutory committees, deals with any possible breaches of those standards, thus there is an overlap of functions. This system is now considered to be inflexible, insufficiently impartial and out of date when compared to the ‘best practice’ seen in other comparable professions. The proposed amendment to the Veterinary Surgeons Act 1966 will separate this overlap of functions thus reflecting better the role of RCVS in balancing public and professional interests. In addition, the current legislation restricts the size of the committees making it difficult for them to manage the caseload, a situation which is unsustainable for the future. It is proposed that these reforms be made by means of a Legislative Reform Order (LRO) under Sections 1 and 2 of the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006 (LRRA). The intention is to use the LRO to amend the provisions of the Veterinary Surgeons Act 1966 that determine the size and membership of PIC and DC. This consultation was conducted in accordance with the requirements of the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006 and the terms of the Government’s Code of Practice on Written Consultations. Legislative Reform Order The Legislative Reform Order (LRO) to amend the provisions of the Veterinary Surgeons Act 1966 relating to the constitution of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons (RCVS) disciplinary committees (Preliminary Investigation Committee (PIC) and Disciplinary Committee (DC)) was laid before Parliament on 5 November 2012. The Regulation will be made early 2013 and will come into force in April. The proposed amendment to the Veterinary Surgeons Act will separate the overlap of functions between those who set the standards (RCVS Council) and those who investigate (PIC) and adjudicate (DC) possible breaches of those standards - statutory committees currently constituted from Council members. The new reform will: Promote the five principles of good regulation i.e. proportionate; accountable; consistent; transparent and targeted; Comply with Human Rights Act 1998 - primarily Article 6 of Schedule 1 - right to a fair trial. Our view is that the new arrangement will further enhance the effectiveness of the disciplinary process.

/government/statistics/rural-geographies,"A guide to rural geography and defining other geographies as rural. Rural geographies  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs There are two ways of classifying areas as rural or urban. The preferred approach is to use the rural urban definition, which is applied to census geographies. Where information is not available at this level, the rural urban classification is applied to larger geographies such as councils, parliamentary constituencies and counties. There are a number of other geographies to which a rural urban classification has been applied. These broadly use the same methodology as that which underpins the local council rural urban classification, based on the proportion of people living in rural settlements and large market towns and the number of people living in urban areas. There are rural urban classifications available for Primary Care Organisations, parliamentary constituencies, NUTS3 statistical territories and a range of higher geographies including police, fire and waste authorities, counties and National Parks.

Myth bust: The Express claims that British sovereignty of the seabed is under threat  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs The Myth: The Daily Express has reported that one of the amendments being debated by the European Parliament on the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy would allow the EU to seize control of Britain’s seabed. The piece claimed that critics have said that if passed the amendment could lead to the EU claiming rights to minerals such as oil and gas. The Truth: This is not true. Even if agreed by the European Parliament, this amendment would not change the sovereignty of our sea bed or give the EU new powers. The proposed amendment would have no practical effect, nor would it have any bearing on mineral extraction. The reform of the Common Fisheries Policy is intended to stop overfishing, boost fish stocks and improve the health of our seas. The UK does not support this amendment as it will not help to tackle the fundamental failings of the Common Fisheries Policy."

The government will also continue to pay lighthouse dues for another year, saving the industry up to £140,000. This is in addition to measures already promised, such as: flexibility on quota allocations to allow fishermen to make up lost income when conditions return to normal access to a £10 million business support grant for flood-affected businesses Fisheries Minister George Eustice said: The appalling storms over the last few months have had a severe impact on fishing communities and we recognise that many fishermen have lost static gear such as lobster and crab pots.” I saw first-hand the damage to net gear during a recent visit to Newlyn. We have made this funding available to minimise the impact on their livelihoods and help them to get back on their feet as quickly as possible.” Notes: Applications for support should be made by 6 June 2014 through the Marine Management Organisation. Funding will be through the European Fisheries Fund storm damage replacement scheme. The MMO will prioritise applications from storm affected areas."

Mackerel is the UK’s most valuable fish stock and this deal will be good for mackerel stocks as well as fishermen. In addition, the EU and Norway have signed an agreement for 2014 on the North Sea fishing quotas that is a very good deal for the UK. It includes a 5% increase in quota for North Sea cod quota. Fisheries Minister George Eustice said: We have secured an important agreement between the EU, Norway and the Faroes on the long-running mackerel dispute. Mackerel is the UK’s most valuable fish stock and this deal is a significant step forward to help manage our stocks effectively. Talks have also ended successfully on the North Sea stocks, with additional fish quotas agreed for the UK fleet for North Sea cod. We also gained 2,600 tonnes of haddock and 750 tonnes of whiting as part of the negotiations which will give UK fishermen more fish to catch."

The proposals have been set out by the Fisheries Minister, George Eustice in one of three consultations on the implementation of the EU’s reformed Common Fisheries Policy. Defra has proposed how the new system of managing quota can be used to help fishermen adapt to the discards ban, and benefit from the extra catch they land. Fisheries Minister, George Eustice said; The discard ban is one of the most important changes to fisheries management in the last decade. We fought hard to put an end to the wasteful practice of throwing fish overboard. Now we must focus on implementing the discards ban in a way that will work well for English fishermen and help them to profit from the extra catch that they land.” A second consultation has been launched on the European Maritime Fisheries Fund, which is used to fund projects aimed at helping fishermen to fish more sustainably, aid adaptation to new fisheries regulations and contribute to economic growth. The third consultation will look for views on the best way to introduce mandatory labelling of fish with information about its species, origins, and the processing or handling the product has undergone from the moment it was landed to the point at which it reaches our plates. The discard ban will apply to ‘pelagic’ fish such as mackerel and herring from 2015, and be rolled out to other species in 2016. The three consultations covering the discards ban , the European Maritime Fisheries Fund and marketing standards and labelling requirements for fishery and aquaculture products All three consultations close on 12 May."

This consultation seeks views on the proposed Transfrontier Shipment of Waste (Amendment) Regulations 2013 which would amend and update the 2007 Regulations. The proposed changes will cover a number of key areas: Setting up the required legal gateway to allow Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) to disclose relevant export data to competent authorities (CAs) in the UK. This will help CAs develop better intelligence on illegal waste exports. Clarifying the role of the CAs for the transit of waste and the marine area. Currently the Secretary of State fulfils this role which was a short term measure. Allowing the Border Force (BF) to stop and detain suspect containers should the opportunity arise. Changing the fees payable for the import and export of waste into and from Northern Ireland. This will better reflect resources needed to enforce the 2013 Regulations and deliver the requirements of the WSR in Northern Ireland. Changes are also needed as a consequence of the establishment of the new Welsh CA, Natural Resources Body for Wales (NRBW). Enforcement functions for waste imported and exported into and from the UK which start or finish in Wales therefore need to be transferred to the new Welsh CA. Anyone may respond to this consultation and comment on any aspect of the proposals.

Reform of Domestic Fisheries Management Arrangements in England  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs The consultation sought views on securing a more prosperous fishing industry with sustainable fish stocks and a health marine environment in the long term, which is set out in the Defra’s Business Plan as a departmental priority. The proposals aimed to empower fishermen to take control of their businesses, plan for the future, and make best use of their fishing opportunities. The key elements of the proposals included: The ability to establish community quota models by fishermen and communities in areas that wish to safeguard a small-scale/community fleet. The allocation of clearer, more stable and predictable quota allocation across the whole English fleet, using the existing Fixed Quota Allocation mechanism. Safeguards to help retain fisheries access rights in more sustainable parts of the fleet (eg members of community quota groups) and prevent fishing rights becoming concentrated in the large scale fleet. Some re-alignment of fishing opportunities across the English fleet, including that associated with consistently un-fished allocations. The consultation was aimed at the fishing industry, coastal communities, and anyone else with an interest, including members of the public. We would like to thank all that responded to the consultation both in writing and through attending the coastal drop-in sessions held around the country. We published the Government response to the consultation on 8 November 2011, a link to which can be found below. In the Government response, we have outlined what the next steps in the process of domestic reform will be, including the establishment of a pilot group in Ramsgate to test a more regionally based management structure. Results from this pilot and through parallel work with the industry will be used to inform the final package of reform for the under-10m fleet in England.

The introduction of any such ban depends on it being agreed by EU Member States and the European Parliament. The Commission’s website explains the plans looking to impose a full ban on driftnet fishing in European waters over concerns about the threat posed to protected species. It refers to the practice as using fishing nets that can drift and operate close to or at the sea surface to target fish species that swim in the upper part of the water column. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) takes part in European level discussions on behalf of the UK and will shortly be seeking the views of industry and other stakeholders on its response to the Commission’s proposal. The MMO’s role is in enforcing EU fisheries regulations and it is providing information to Defra on this proposal, including on the use of driftnets by the UK fleet and views it has received from the fishing industry.

The response sets out that from 6 April 2014 the MMO’s ability to recover its costs from marine licence applications will be extended. The Marine Licensing (Application Fees) Regulations 2014 has been published and it extends the MMO’s powers under the Marine and Coastal Access 2009 and introduces a revised fees structure for marine licence applications. The new fees allow the MMO to recover 96% of costs and subsidise the remaining 4% to limit increases in fees for smaller projects. There is a new hourly rate of £94 for all projects, but there will be upper limits for fast tracked or routine projects. The MMO is writing to tier 3 applicants – applications for bespoke projects where the time needed to deal with applications may vary – whose cases will be ongoing on 6 April to advise them of the changes to fees. These applicants will see an increase from £80 an hour to the new £94 rate.

North Sea trials show less than 1 percent of cod discarded Regulations, monitoring and enforcement Marine Management Organisation Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs The MMO is operating the catch quota trials on behalf of Defra as part of the UK’s initiative to tackle the problem of discarding fish – where fish are thrown away at sea if they are too small or there is no quota left for a particular species. The trials encourage fishermen to fish more selectively and land all of what they catch. 12 vessels took part in the scheme in the North Sea in 2013. They were awarded additional quota for North Sea cod and had an obligation to land and count all catches of cod against quota. They were also fitted with electronic monitoring systems with CCTV to observe and record fishing activity. The report details how the practice is proving a successful, alternative method of managing fisheries. Results for the 2013 trials show an overall estimated discard rate of North Sea cod of 0.03% (496kg) from a total sampled catch of 1452 tonnes. Julian Roberts, Catch Quota Trials Manager for the MMO , said: “We’d like to thank fishermen involved in the trials. I’m pleased to report continued involvement from the fishing industry in the scheme - participant levels have increased from 11 to 14 vessels since the start of 2014.” The trials are providing the MMO with a better understanding of how a ban on discarding fish may work in practice is.

The works are scheduled for completion in December 2015 and will improve the flood protection to more than 1,300 homes and 100 businesses by increasing the standard of protection to the area from 1 in 20 years to 1 in 200 years. The scheme will also protect vital infrastructure in the area including the main coastal road and sewage treatment works. The scheme is supported using public funding by the National Lottery through Arts Council England and the Environment Agency has used this funding to employ an artist, Will Nash, to design and produce some sculptures which will be worked into the final scheme. The sculptures are to be formed out of the remnant timber groynes and will be installed in the area. In order to construct the scheme safely, sections of beach will need to be closed periodically throughout the project. As much of the beach will be made available to the public as possible, with a minimum of 200metres always open. Ian Nunn, Environment Agency Operations Manager, said: I am delighted that work is able to start on this important new scheme, an essential project which I know is important for the people of Camber and Lydd Ranges.

Catch Quota Trial Final Report 2013 - western haddock Regulations, monitoring and enforcement Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Marine Management Organisation A trial has been carried out on a trawler fishing under a discard ban for Area VIIb-k haddock, which is caught amongst a diverse range of over 20 species in the south west mixed fishery. On-shore observers estimated that less than 0.01% incidental discards and less than 1% of the haddock catch was below the minimum landing size or damaged. The fishery in the area is fished by over 130 UK vessels, which discard about 62% of haddock because of quota restrictions. The results of the trial show the potential effect of a haddock as a choke species – a low quota species that, when the quota is gone, would lead vessels to stop fishing even if they still had quota for other species. The data suggests that the south west trawl fleet faces challenges in avoiding haddock catches, which could result in an early closure to this fishery when the quota is exhausted. This report follows an interim document published in June 2014 which stated haddock catches would continue to be documented until the end of the scheme. The final report includes this data. It is also connected to a report about trials carried out by fishermen of different trawl designs which have dramatically reduced overall haddock catches across all size ranges. These trials were carried out following participation in the catch quota trial scheme."

/guidance/dangers-to-marine-species-and-measures-to-protect-them,"Find out the measures the UK and EC are taking to reduce fishing industry threats to marine life, such as overfishing, finning, and bycatch Dangers to marine species and measures to protect them  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Introduction Some of the activities pursued by the commercial fishing industry put many marine species at risk. Sharks, for example, are affected by over-fishing and practices such as ‘finning’ - the removal of their fins before disposing the carcass at sea. Sharks, along with other marine species such as seabirds and dolphins, can also get caught accidentally in fishing gear and drown (known as by-catch). The threat to marine life caused by fishing has become an important issue which the government has tried to prevent by introducing several pieces of legislation. European Commission ( EC ) regulations provide Europe-wide protection to a number of species, and the UK has worked to ensure that such measures are strong, comprehensive and effective. This guide highlights the dangers marine species face and outlines the measures taken to reduce those threats. Sharks, skates and rays Sharks, skates and rays - cartilaginous fish known as elasmobranchs - are caught in commercial fisheries in European and UK waters. Many species are over-fished and their numbers have fallen to dangerously low levels. Although some species are no longer fished commercially, often because they have a Total Allowable Catch of zero under the Common Fisheries Policy, species such as angel shark and white skate must be returned to the water if caught unintentionally. Elasmobranchs are particularly at risk of over-fishing because: their migratory nature regularly leads them across international boundaries, making them difficult to manage they mature slowly and take a long time to reach breeding age they have relatively few young Read our shark, skate and ray conservation plan and the 2013 review of progress . Protective measures The UK government is committed to making sure that all fisheries on elasmobranch species are sustainable, and that endangered species have adequate protection. It has done, and will continue to do so by: implementing our shark, skate and ray conservation plan introducing appropriate, scientifically-based conservation and fishery management measures within the EU and internationally improving controls on the catches of sharks wherever they are caught regulating the trade of shark products banning wasteful ‘finning’ wherever it takes place The Wildlife and Countryside Act The Wildlife and Countryside Act ( WCA ) affords protection to rare species of animals and plants, such as the angel shark and white skate, with both species now being listed in the revised Schedule 5. This means that you will be committing an offence if you intentionally or recklessly kill, injure, take, possess, transport or trade in either species up to 12 nautical miles off the English and Welsh coast. You can read questions and answers about the Shark Action Plan on the Europa website. Shark finning The demand for shark fin soup in some parts of the world has led to an increase in the practice of ‘shark finning’. This involves removing and retaining the fins from a shark on board a fishing vessel and disposing of the carcass at sea. The UK does not support the practice of removing shark fins before landing and does not permit landings of sharks with their fins removed. Recently it has successfully called for mandatory ‘fin on’ landings to be introduced and properly enforced across the EU fleet through a change to European Council Regulation 1185/2003. This means all EU vessels wherever they fish must now follow the same practices as UK registered which are required to land sharks with their “Fins Naturally Attached”, wherever they fish. This is by far the simplest and most reliable way to ensure an end to shark finning, and is practiced by many other countries around the world. The UK produces reports under Regulation 1185/2003. See the 2011 report [InlineAttachment:1] Tope Tope belong to the shark family and are found in European continental-shelf and coastal waters. Their numbers are at risk from fishing pressure because they: take around 12 years to reach maturity and start breeding produce relatively low numbers of young (known as pups) are an inevitable by-catch in commercial fisheries for other species Tope is a relatively low-value species commercially, although it is traditionally eaten in certain countries. In the UK, tope is a highly-prized sport fish. Protective measures The UK introduced the Tope (Prohibition of Fishing) Order 2008 to protect the species by limiting by-catch and preventing the development of commercial tope-fishing operations. The legislation applies within English and Welsh fishery limits and is designed to protect tope numbers by: banning all fishing for tope except by rod and line setting a 45 kilogram per day by-catch limit for tope in commercial fisheries for other species requiring any tope landed by commercial fishing vessels to have their head and fins still attached preventing recreational anglers from landing any tope - whether dead or alive - caught from a boat The legislation is designed to make recreational anglers and the commercial fishing community jointly responsible for tope conservation. Dolphins, porpoises and whales Dolphins, porpoises and whales belong to a group of marine mammals known as cetaceans. The UK Government has long worked to protect and conserve cetaceans both around the UK and internationally. There are 28 species of cetacean that have been recorded in UK waters, of which 11 appear regularly. All cetaceans are legally protected throughout Europe under the Habitats Directive, and specifically in the UK under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. Under UK law it is illegal to: kill or injure a cetacean intentionally ‘recklessly disturb’ a cetacean - for example to cause it distress by chasing it in a boat The UK has signed up to the Agreement on the Conservation of Small Cetaceans of the Baltic, North East Atlantic, Irish and North Seas ( ASCOBANS ). This agreement aims to restore and maintain populations of small cetaceans through the co-ordination and implementation of conservation measures. You can find out about small cetacean conservation on the ASCOBANS website. Fisheries impact on cetacean by-catch Although cetaceans have legal protection throughout Europe, they are sometimes caught and injured or killed accidentally during commercial fishing activities. When caught in fishing nets cetaceans, like dolphins and porpoises, are unable to surface to breathe, so often suffocate - this is known as ‘incidental by-catch’. Council Regulation ( EC ) No. 812/2004 governs the by-catch of cetaceans. Work undertaken to meet our obligations under this regulation is focused on: monitoring cetacean by-catch the development of mitigation measures Monitoring The UK has a detailed and thorough cetacean monitoring programme to ascertain the extent of the by-catch problem. While any by-catch is undesirable, recent population estimates suggest that porpoise and dolphin populations are not currently under threat. Certain UK fisheries, such as static gillnets in the south west of England and the North Sea, are thought to have higher-than-normal by-catch rates. The monitoring programme focuses on these fisheries and areas to improve understanding and reduce by-catch levels. Mitigation measures The UK seeks to reduce the number of cetaceans that become accidentally caught (bycaught) in fishing gear. We have collaborated with the fishing industry on this issue. European legislation requires fishing vessels over a certain size to have acoustic deterrent devices - often referred to as a ‘pingers’ fitted - to deter cetaceans from approaching fishing gear and so reducing by-catch levels. The UK government carried out detailed research to identify an effective pinger that is safe for fishermen to use. There are a number of authorised/compliant pingers available. For more information, please see: www.marinemanagement.org.uk . The UK submits an annual report to the European Commission on the steps taken to reduce cetacean bycatch, as required under European Council Regulation EC 812/2004 . Pair trawling for bass Pair trawling for bass off the south-west coast of England has been shown to have a high level of cetacean by-catch compared to other fisheries. Because of this, pelagic pair trawling for bass by UK vessels is banned within 12 miles of the south-west coast of England (International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) area VIIe). Other bass fisheries, such as gillnetting and handlining, and pair trawl fisheries targeting other species, are not affected by the ban. Statutory Instrument banning pair trawling Amendment to Statutory Instrument banning pair trawling The UK requested that the ban on pelagic pair trawling for bass be extended to vessels from other EU member states, but this request was turned down by the EC . These vessels are currently permitted to fish between six and 12 miles off the coast of south-west England. Seabirds Research suggests that a large number of seabirds are killed each year by getting caught in commercial fishing gear and becoming part of the by-catch. The seabirds most at risk from fishing activities include: shearwaters petrels fulmars gannets gulls sea dusks divers auks and grebes The Balearic shearwater is a critically endangered species that is particularly threatened by fishing activity in the Mediterranean. EU Seabird Action Plan The European Commission published its Seabird Bycatch Plan of Action in November 2012. Its main objective is: to minimise and, where possible, eliminate the incidental catches of seabirds, with priority action focussing on individuals belonging to at least 49 threatened seabird populations by EU vessels operating in EU and non- EU waters, as well as by non- EU vessels operating in EU waters. For other seabirds where populations are stable but bycatch are at levels that are cause for concern, bycatch should be reduced as a first step towards bycatch elemination. You can read the Plan of Action and Summary News Release Seabird by-catch in international waters The UK works with other countries and organisations to reduce seabird by-catch in international waters. It was involved with the development of the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels ( ACAP ) in the Southern Oceans , and it continues to work with the EC to encourage regional fisheries management organisations to act on reducing seabird by-catch on the high seas.

The high temperature, high pressure well will be used to safely block and permanently seal the Elgin G4 well, the source of the current leak, should a dynamic kill operation also being planned prove unsuccessful. The Health and Safety Executive has confirmed it has no objections to this intended activity. The relief well will be drilled from the SEDCO714 drilling rig which will be located approximately 1.2km East of the Elgin G4 well in water around 90m deep. The anticipated vertical depth of the completed well is approximately 4,400m and will take around 180 days of drilling to complete. TOTAL is also continuing to work with Government on their preferred option of a dynamic kill, that will use heavy mud to block the well. A DECC spokesman said: “We are happy with the progress TOTAL is making to resolve this incident as quickly as possible.

A dynamic kill operation has successfully used heavy mud to stem the flow of gas from the G4 well. This is the first stage in the process to permanently seal the well. Monitoring will now take place over the next few days to assess the complete success of the operation. After that, work can begin to permanently plug and abandon the well. Energy Minister Charles Hendry said: “The fact TOTAL has managed to stop gas leaking from the Elgin platform is clearly excellent news. We will continue to monitor the success of the operation closely to ensure that the well can now be safely and permanently secured. “The Government has been working closely with TOTAL throughout this incident to resolve it as quickly and safely as possible with minimum impact on the environment.” The Secretary of State for Scotland, Michael Moore added: “This is welcome news from the Elgin platform and good progress.

Energy Minister Charles Hendry said: “TOTAL confirmed to me this morning that the flare on the Elgin platform has naturally extinguished itself. “This comes as very welcome news and a considerable relief. Although the platform was designed to use the prevailing wind to keep the flare from the escaping gas, the fact the flare is out removes a major risk from the equation. “The task now is very clear - every effort must be made to locate and stop the gas leak. Following my visit to TOTAL’s emergency control room yesterday, I know they have some of the best expertise in the world on hand to consider their options. “The Government continues to monitor the situation very closely to ensure this incident can be resolved as quickly and with as little risk to human life and the environment as possible.” Notes for Editors TOTAL is considering two options to tackle the gas release: Drilling a relief well - TOTAL are mobilising two drill rigs to drill a well to intersect the main well and then shut off the flow of gas.

/government/news/elgin-platform-incident,"29 March 2012  This is an update statement on the Elgin field gas leak in the North Sea from the Department of Energy and Climate Change.  Following… Elgin platform incident  Closed organisation: Department of Energy & Climate Change 29 March 2012 This is an update statement on the Elgin field gas leak in the North Sea from the Department of Energy and Climate Change. Following the safe evacuation of all crew from the Elgin platform on Sunday 25 March work continues by TOTAL, the operator of the field, to assess the options available to deal with the continuing gas release. The situation remains stable. LOCATION OF LEAK Using the best data currently available, TOTAL believes the gas is being released from the well system to the environment at the platform deck level, and therefore above water. TOTAL is working on the belief that a failure of the well system has caused gas to enter another part of the well not normally designed to handle gas. The point of entry has been estimated at a point 4,000m below the seabed and this is allowing gas to travel contained within the well system to the platform. There is no evidence that gas is being released below sea level. ACTION TO TACKLE THE LEAK TOTAL is considering two options to tackle the gas release: a Drilling a relief well - TOTAL are mobilising two drill rigs to drill a well to intersect the main well and then shut off the flow of gas. a Blocking the well with “heavy mud” - using a mixture containing mineral compounds to be pumped into the well to suppress the flow of gas. GOVERNMENT RESPONSE DECC and HSE inspectors are fully updated and briefed in person at daily meetings with TOTAL at TOTAL’s emergency response unit in Aberdeen. The Department of Energy and Climate Change convened a Government Regulators’ Group yesterday with Government bodies and departments including experts from DECC, the Health and Safety Executive, Maritime and Coastguard Agency, Marine Scotland and Marine Lab to ensure the UK Government ‘s response, advised by the Scottish Government’s agency Marine Scotland, is coherent and joined up during this incident. That group will now meet on a regular basis to consider TOTAL’s actions and the Government’s response to the incident. Clearly this is a very concerning incident but we should recognise that so far the response from TOTAL and Government agencies has been very effective. Everyone has been evacuated from the platform safely and TOTAL are looking at options to stop the release of gas as quickly as possible. LIT FLARE TOTAL has confirmed in their latest update to the Government’s inspectors today that the flare remains lit but observations from the latest aerial surveillance suggest that the flame appears to be reducing in size. There have been reports, following an interview with Good Morning Scotland on Monday, that Energy Minister Charles Hendry said it was possible to remotely switch off the flare. This was a faithful statement of the information as he was briefed but it has become apparent that this information was misinterpreted. The Minister would like to make clear the flare cannot actually be switched off remotely. TOTAL has assured the Government the platform is designed so the flare is located in a position where the prevailing wind blows the gas release away from it. Weather conditions remain favourable for the foreseeable future. While alight, the flare remains a risk and TOTAL is considering options for extinguishing it directly if it does not go out itself. Three possibilities have been proposed - using a helicopter to drop water or other material to extinguish the flame or using fire fighting vessels, if their fire monitors are capable of reaching the height of the flare. A third option is to extinguish the flare by purging with nitrogen depending on safe access to the platform. AMOUNT OF GAS CONDENSATE AT SEA Aerial surveillance is being conducted three times a day. The latest observations found that that the sheen has spread to an area of 22km x 4.5km and the maximum volume of gas condensate in the water is 3.8 tonnes. DECC’s view is that there remains no substantial risk to the environment.

TOTAL has made available on their website the summaries of the aircraft surveillance flights that have been carried out since the beginning of the Elgin gas leak incident and the analysis of seawater samples collected from the sea surface near the installation in areas affected by the release. The aerial surveillance flights indicate that the sheen is dispersing naturally, and the analyses confirm that the sheen consists of a lightly weathered condensate that is expected to have a minimal environmental impact as it will evaporate and be dispersed in the water column within a fairly short period of time. A DECC spokesman said: “As with any incident, it is vital that this incident is dealt with in an open and transparent way and the Government welcomes TOTAL’s decision to make this environmental information available on their website.” Environment group established The Government Interest Group has set up an Environment Group to review and share information between government and industry environmental advisors, to supplement the good flow of information that has been provided by TOTAL since the beginning of the incident. The intention is to ensure that environmental issues and monitoring continues to be an integral part of this operation. Following the group’s first meeting yesterday to consider the latest information, it was concluded that the risk to the marine environment remains minimal. The Environment Group brings together representatives from the Department of Energy Climate Change (DECC), the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), Marine Scotland (MS), the Joint Nature Conservancy Committee (JNCC), Health Protection Scotland (HPS), Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH), Food Standards Agency Scotland (FSAS), Maritime Coastguard Agency (MCA), SEPA and in this case the relevant operator TOTAL. Notes for editors The environmental data released by TOTAL can be found on the company’s website. The Government has appointed The Secretary of State’s representative (SoSRep) to provide overall direction for salvage, intervention and the prevention of marine pollution incidents involving ships or offshore installations. More information can be found on the DfT website. The Government Interest Group (GIG) has been established to allow an interchange of information and informed decision making between all relevant parties.

All personnel are reported safe with no injuries. The incident occurred during work to plug and abandon the well, which was no longer producing gas. Total has now shut in all wells but remote monitoring has revealed that gas continues to be released. In addition a sheen was observed on the sea surface in the vicinity of the installations. The sheen is believed to be gas condensate, a petrol like substance that typically disperses naturally to the atmosphere within hours of release. Because of the nature of gas condensate there is no indication of a risk of significant pollution to the environment. Aerial surveillance, mobilised by Total and conducted at 08.45hrs today found a light sheen with a dimension of 6 x 0.75 nautical miles. The estimated quantity of hydrocarbon associated with the sheen is between two and 23.5 tonnes. Another aerial surveillance flight departed at 1500hrs today as part of the ongoing monitoring operation of the area. The priority now is to plan an appropriate response to contain the leak and minimise the impact to the environment. Total have established their Emergency Response Centre (ERC) and have activated their Oil Pollution Emergency Plan. A DECC Offshore Environmental Inspector has been present in the ERC and DECC continues to monitoring the ongoing response. The Secretary of State’s Representative for Maritime Salvage and Intervention (SOSREP) is aware of the incident and is closely monitoring Total’s response.

Exercise Sula was held in Scotland in May to test the UK’s response to an uncontrolled release of hydrocarbons into the sea from a deep water well. This was the first time an exercise had been held using a deep water scenario. It was also the first major, national exercise to incorporate all aspects of the national contingency plan (NCP) and the full establishment of various response cells. The work of each cell was monitored by a group of industry and environmental experts. Their findings are that overall, the exercise showed the UK could deal with an incident of this type. In the foreword of the report, Philip Naylor, Director of Maritime Services at the MCA, and Wendy Kennedy, Head of Offshore Environment and Decommissioning Unit at the Department of Energy & Climate Change, said: “The exercise demonstrated that the UK has highly professional and dedicated personnel who can respond effectively. As could be expected with any well-planned and tested scenario, the exercise highlighted some areas for improvement and identified a number of learning points which can be directly applied in future.” Notes to editors Read the Sula report on the MCA website This exercise was led by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) and Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC). Also participating in the exercise: Chevron Upstream Europe, Oil Spill Response, Stena Offshore, Briggs Environmental, Braemar Howells, BP (Sullom Voe terminal), Shetland Islands Council, Marine Scotland, Hess, Joint Nature Conservation Committee, Northern Constabulary, Scottish Natural Heritage, Foods Standards Agency, Scottish Fisheries Association, Oil & Gas UK and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency. Exercise Sula tested the participants response to an unfolding scenario, involving the uncontrolled release of hydrocarbons into the sea from a deep water well operated by Chevron Upstream Europe at the Cambo Well Site, 86 miles west of Shetland. This exercise gave the UK an opportunity to assess its response capability to a release from a wellhead 1,000 metres below the surface. Because the exercise scenario involved the weather and tides forcing the oil to land onshore, there was also the opportunity to test a shoreline response in Shetland. For further details contact the Maritime and Coastguard Agency Press Office on (023) 8032 9401 or pager 07699729089, or visit the MCA website for more information about the agency."

/government/news/government-to-start-quicker-publication-of-oil-spill-data,"30 March 2012  Energy Minister Charles Hendry has announced that oil spill data will be made public by the Government more quickly after stressing… Government to start quicker publication of oil spill data  Closed organisation: Department of Energy & Climate Change 30 March 2012 Energy Minister Charles Hendry has announced that oil spill data will be made public by the Government more quickly after stressing the importance of dealing with the Elgin gas leak in an open and transparent way. Speaking at a joint press conference held today in Aberdeen with Philippe Guys Managing Director, Total E&P UK of TOTAL, Charles Hendry praised the oil firm for their swift and well executed emergency response that meant all 238 crew could be evacuated safely from the Elgin platform in just three and a half hours. He added the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) was responding to the need for transparency by regularly publishing all spill data received by DECC in the Petroleum Operations Notice 1(PON1) from operators. Currently PON1 data is published annually in the Advisory Committee on Protection of the Sea’s report. From Monday, that information will be published monthly on the DECC website. Historical data from the start of this year will also be added. Charles Hendry said: “In my discussions this morning with Philippe Guys at TOTAL we focused on the progress that has been made tackling the Elgin gas leak and the need for a very clear strategy moving forward - so that there’s a great deal of transparency about how this process will work and what is expected at each stage of that process. “It’s important that this incident is dealt with in an open and transparent way. From the Government’s perspective the Elgin field’s oil pollution emergency plan has been put on the DECC website to give people the opportunity to analyse that information in detail. “From Monday my department will be making all oil spill data available more quickly on the DECC website. Information on spills which have been reported to DECC going back to the beginning of this year will be put on there as well. “We have also established a Government regulator’s group to allow a full interchange of information and to inform decisions between all the relevant parties. The Health and Safety Executive is an integral part of that process together with the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, Marine Scotland and, of course, DECC itself.” Notes for Editors From Monday 2 April PON1 data will be made available on the DECC website. Petroleum Operations Notice 1 (PON1) is the notification used by operators and permit holders to notify DECC of all oil and chemical releases to sea - no matter how small. At present, PON1 spill data from offshore installations is published annually in the Advisory Committee on Protection of the Sea (ACOPS) survey . The publication of PON1 data will be on a monthly basis and will supplement the annual statistics currently available on our website : View the Elgin Field Oil Pollution Emergency Plan (OPEP) More on Elgin Elgin gas released stopped (16 May 2012) Work to stem Elgin gas release begins (15 May 2012) Operation to stop gas release from Elgin well given environmental go-ahead (3 May 2012) Statement: Elgin relief well given go-ahead (18 April 2012) Government Interest Group (11 April 2012) Update (5 April 2012) Elgin platform flare is out (31 March 2012) Update (29 March 2012) Update (26 March 2012) Oil Pollution Emergency Plan for the Elgin gas field published by DECC (23 January 2012)"

The two vessels are operated by Teekay Petrojarl on behalf of the licence holder CNR International. All 67 persons on board the two vessels have been accounted for and are safe. The Apollo Spirit, which is storing 96,300 tonnes of oil, has lost tension in one of its eight anchors but remains securely in position. The Banff, which has 4,400 tonnes of crude oil on board, had lost tension in five of its ten anchors. At the height of the storm the vessel moved up to 250 metres from its operational position. The vessel is now stable approximately 70 metres from its original position. The subsea isolation valves have been closed and secured, the maximum volume of the pipelines from the vessel to the isolation valves is approximately 120 tonnes, this includes the export line between the vessels. There has been no report of pollution and the risk of any spillage at this time is very low. However we are closely monitoring the situation. An anchor handling vessel is on site and lending support to both vessels. CNR International has mobilised four additional anchor handling tugs to provide further assistance. DECC has initiated its incident response procedures and is working with all relevant agencies.”"

The two vessels are operated by Teekay Petrojarl on behalf of the licence holder CNR International. Although adverse weather has had an impact on the response, the Apollo Spirit has now been secured on all eight of its anchors and the vessel is now stable. I can confirm it was storing 79,900 tonnes of crude oil, which has all been transferred to the tanker Nancy Knutsen and is being shipped to port. The Petrojarl Banff, which contains a confirmed 3,616 tonnes of crude oil, is also now stable with the use of its five operational anchors and three thrusters, with an additional line attached to the anchor handling tug, the Skandi Saigon. The subsea isolation valves were closed at the time of the incident and are secure. An approved operation is ongoing to conduct a controlled flush of the risers and remove the estimated 12 tonnes of oil they contain back to the Petrojarl Banff. Upon completion of the riser flushing, operations will commence to disconnect the Petrojarl Banff from the risers. In the worst case scenario, it is possible that up to 1.8 tonnes of crude oil could be released to sea during this disconnection process. If this occurs, the oil will cause minimal environmental impact and be dispersed naturally at sea. All persons on the vessels are safe and there were no other reports of oil release during the operation. I will continue to approve and monitor the ongoing plans of CNR International and Teekay Petrojarl to disconnect the two vessels from the subsea infrastructure and relocate both to a place of refuge. No further statements to this are expected to be issued.”"

The operation will use heavy drilling mud pumped into the G4 well from the wellhead to stop the gas release. DECC has carried out full environmental assessment of the operation and the Health and Safety Executive has confirmed it has no objections to this intended activity. The well intervention operation will use the West Phoenix drilling rig as the pumping vessel, which will be located alongside the Elgin complex. A DECC spokesman said: “The Government and TOTAL have been working hard to ensure the Elgin gas release is dealt with as quickly and as safely as possible with minimal impact on the environment. “The dynamic kill operation is a major step for TOTAL and offers the quickest way to stop the release from the well. In parallel, work is underway to drill a relief well as an alternative solution.

The publications cover new data for the fourth quarter of 2011 and thus provisional annual data for 2011. This press release focuses on the 2011 annual data. Energy Trends covers statistics on energy production and consumption, in total and by fuel, and provides an analysis of the year on year changes, and now includes a section on renewables. Quarterly Energy Prices covers prices to domestic and industrial consumers, prices of oil products and comparisons of international fuel prices. The main points for 2011 are: Total energy production was a record 13½ per cent lower than in 2010. This decline in output was due to the falls in oil and gas production as a result of maintenance activities and slowdowns, which resulted in a net import dependency of 36½ per cent, the highest level since 1976. Oil production was 17½ per cent lower than in 2010, the lowest level of production since the 1970’s and continues the downward trend seen since 2000. Natural gas production was 21 per cent lower than in 2010. In 2011 gross imports of natural gas were greater than gross production for the first time since 1967, with Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) accounting for 47 per cent of gas imports. Gas exports were at record levels in 2011, up by 4 per cent. Production though continued to exceed net imports. Total primary energy consumption for energy uses fell by 7½ per cent from 2010. When adjusted to take account of weather differences between 2010 and 2011, primary consumption fell by 2 per cent. Low carbon electricity’s share of generation increased from 23 per cent in 2010 to 28½ per cent in 2011, due to higher renewables and nuclear generation. Of electricity generated in 2011, gas accounted for 40 per cent (a fall of 6 percentage points on 2010) and coal 30 per cent. Nuclear’s share increased by 3 percentage points on 2010, to 19 per cent of the total. Renewables’ share of generation increased by 2½ percentage points on 2010 to a record 9½ per cent. Hydro generation increased by 58 per cent on 2010 as a result of higher rainfall, whilst wind rose by 54½ per cent, of which offshore wind rose by 68 per cent, due to higher wind speeds and increased capacity. Overall hydro and wind generation was 55½ per cent higher than in 2010. Coal production was ½ per cent lower than in 2010. Coal imports were 23 per cent higher. Generators’ demand for coal was higher by ½ per cent. Coal stocks were 4½ per cent lower. Final energy consumption was 8 per cent lower than in 2010, with falls recorded in all sectors. Domestic consumption fell by 18½ per cent due to the milder weather in 2011, with temperatures being 1.8 degrees warmer than 2010. Gas demand was 17 per cent lower than in 2010 and was at its lowest level since 1995, whilst electricity consumption was 3½ per cent lower in 2011 than in 2010. Average annual household standard electricity bills (fixed consumption of 3,300 kWh per annum) across all payment types in 2011 are £36 higher than in 2010 (up 8.5 per cent to £453), and average gas bills (fixed consumption of 18,000 kWh per annum) across all payment types are £61 higher (up 9.3 per cent to £719). UK domestic gas and electricity prices are the lowest and fourth lowest in the EU respectively. Unleaded petrol and diesel prices in March 2012 have reached new record highs.

/government/news/uk-pledges-support-for-chernobyl-safety,"The United Kingdom today joined international partners in contributing to a fund to ensure the permanent safety of the site of the 1986 Chernobyl… UK pledges support for Chernobyl safety  Closed organisation: Department of Energy & Climate Change The United Kingdom today joined international partners in contributing to a fund to ensure the permanent safety of the site of the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster. This came as delegations from around the world gathered in Kiev to mark the 25th anniversary of the world’s most severe nuclear disaster. As part of the G8’s commitment to the safety and stabilisation of the Chernobyl site, the UK has made contributions totalling £28.5m in this donor pledging round to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD)-managed international funds. This contribution, which is in addition to UK contributions in previous pledging rounds of over €81M, will go towards the construction of a 257 metre-wide and 105 metre-high steel arch over the damaged Reactor 4 and a facility to safely and securely store the spent nuclear fuel from Reactors 1-3. The funds will help convert the site of the 1986 accident and the increasingly unstable sarcophagus over the damaged Reactor 4 at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant into a safe and secure condition, preventing the further release of radioactive material into the environment. Representing the UK, Energy Minister Charles Hendry said: “The disaster at Chernobyl had a profound effect on the Ukrainian people, their neighbours and their environment, and on the world. “Many countries, including the UK, were affected by the radioactive material from the Chernobyl disaster. As a result governments across the world continue to work vigorously to ensure the utmost standards of safety. “The funding we are pledging today will go some way to international efforts to ensure the permanent safety and stability of the Chernobyl site, to prevent it from posing any further hazard to health and the environment.” Notes for editors More detail on pledges to the Chernobyl Shelter Fund The £28.5m in this donor pledging round includes £9.5m in 2008 from the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI)-managed Global Threat Reduction Programme to the EBRD-managed Chernobyl Shelter Fund (CSF) and Nuclear Safety Account, plus a contribution in March 2011 of £19m from Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) funds. The G7/8 has led on contributions to Chernobyl since the 1997 G7 Denver Summit, and has made commitments to the remediation of Chernobyl in most summit declarations since then. The 2010 Muskoka G8 Declaration stated: “As we approach the 25th anniversary of the Chernobyl accident in 2011, we will take the necessary steps to complete the final stages of the Chernobyl safety and stabilization projects”.

This is to ensure that there is a mechanism for budgetary control in place until we are able to introduce a flexible degression-based system, which would be able to respond to deployment and gradually lower tariffs as the scheme grows. The consultation sought views on whether a notice period of up to one month should be given prior to a suspension, as there is a trade-off between the amount of notice and the extent to which the trigger would need to be set conservatively. Current application levels are low relative to the available budget and if these levels continue the proposed interim cost control measure is unlikely to be needed.

It builds on earlier work and draws in additional data sources to provide an enhanced understanding of the end use components that make up peak electricity demand. To capture the impact of change over the course of a year, the model considers the daily demand profile for the day in which peak demand occurred (in 2006), in each quarter. This showed that lighting, catering, consumer electronics and, in the summer quarters cooling, are the building end uses where there is likely to be the most potential for demand reduction."

/government/case-studies/global-threat-reduction-programme-support-for-international-remediation-work-at-chernobyl,"The UK's contribution to international remediation efforts at Chernobyl. Global Threat Reduction Programme: Support for international remediation work at Chernobyl  Closed organisation: Department of Energy & Climate Change The UK has contributed to international remediation efforts at Chernobyl since the early 1990s, when the G7 group of leading nations committed to support countries in Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union in making safety improvements to their Nuclear Power Plants. This was expanded in 1995 to provide specific assistance to Ukraine for the closure of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, and in 1997 to include a commitment to transform the existing shelter – built as a temporary measure over the destroyed reactor Unit 4 following the accident in 1986 - to a stable and environmentally safe state. International remediation efforts at Chernobyl are managed by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and funded through two accounts: the Chernobyl Shelter Fund (CSF) and the Nuclear Safety Account (NSA). To date the UK has contributed over €115 million to these funds, including a contribution of £28.5 million announced at the Pledging Conference in Kyiv on 19 April 2011, and in recent years has led efforts to encourage further donations from other countries – including hosting a pledging conference in 2005 which raised $200 million. There are two main strands of remediation activity at Chernobyl: the provision of treatment facilities for radioactive waste and interim storage for spent nuclear fuel, to support safe decommissioning of reactor Units 1-3 the Shelter Implementation Plan ( SIP ), designed to transform the existing arrangements at the destroyed reactor Unit 4 to a stable and environmentally safe state Decommissioning: treatment and storage facilities Achievements to date include construction of a storage facility for short-lived radioactive waste and a treatment centre for solid radioactive waste. In addition, a contract has been let for construction of low- and intermediate-level liquid radioactive waste. An interim spent fuel storage facility is scheduled for completion in 2014/15, with the delivery of casks for the spent fuel storage continuing for two to three years after, since they are not all required at the same time. SIP The SIP was developed by international and Ukrainian experts in 1997 and agreed between the G7, EU and Ukraine as a step-by-step solution to the situation at Chernobyl. The Plan’s aim is to stabilise and replace the existing shelter surrounding the destroyed Unit 4 reactor at Chernobyl and to deal with outstanding radioactive waste problems at the site, in order to prevent any further serious release of radioactive material to the environment. Major emergency work on the existing shelter was carried out in 1998-99, and a programme of stabilisation measures was completed in late 2006. The largest SIP project is the design and construction of the “New Safe Confinement”, a150-metre long, 18,000-tonne metal arch, over the existing shelter, that will confine radioactive material and provide protection from rainwater and snow over a minimum lifespan of a hundred years. To limit workers’ exposure to radiation, the arch will be assembled away from the existing shelter and then rolled into place on rails. A series of projects has now been completed to: provide infrastructure facilities for the construction site, including refurbished utility provision, new road and rail connections and a large changing facility with medical and radiation screening provision introduce a number of programmes to ensure adequate worker safety and protection, notably systematic medical care and screening programmes and a training programme to help develop a new safety culture install a new nuclear, radiation and seismic Integrated Monitoring System and improve site access control and physical protection systems The Novarka Consortium has been contracted to build the New Safe Confinement. By April 2011, piling activities and foundations for the erection cranes in arch assembly area were well under way in preparation for construction of the arch. The current assessment is that the arch will be slid into position in Summer 2015, and commissioned in late 2015."

Global Threat Reduction Programme: Atomflot spent nuclear fuel interim storage facility and site security upgrades  Closed organisation: Department of Energy & Climate Change Global Partnership priority has been to make safe and secure the significant quantities of Soviet spent nuclear fuel ( SNF ) and radioactive waste stored in dangerous and inadequate conditions in North West Russia. In 2008 the UK completed a £24.4 million programme of work to build a SNF interim storage facility at the Atomflot site near Murmansk, supply fifty SNF storage casks and improve the site’s physical protection system. This facility is providing safe long-term storage for 3,500 spent fuel rods that cannot be reprocessed at the present time. The SNF has been in inadequate and dangerous floating storage on the nuclear submarine support vessel ‘Lotta’, which supports nuclear submarine decommissioning by carrying SNF from shipyards to Atomflot for dispatch to the Russian reprocessing plant at Mayak in the Urals. Russia began to repackage and transfer the SNF from the ‘Lotta’ in 2008 and expects to complete this process in 2012. By the end of 2010, 26 casks had been filled and placed in the store. The UK is now contributing to a modest three-year programme to support Atomflot in assuming full responsibility for the ongoing maintenance and upkeep of UK-funded security improvements."

Since the gas condensate release was stopped in May, periodic circulation of oil based drilling mud has been used to control the well. This has resulted in a number of mud discharges over the course of the operations, which have been observed to sink with no visible impact outside the immediate vicinity of the Elgin complex. TOTAL have now fitted a specially designed system and transferred a supply of storage tanks to the installation to capture the oil based mud and minimise the potential for further discharges. An estimate of the quantity of hydrocarbons released during the G4 release has been reported by TOTAL to the HSE. Estimated quantities released to the atmosphere: Gas - 3096 tonnes Condensate - 3076 tonnes An estimated 407 tonnes of the gas condensate was reported to DECC as settling on sea and forming a surface sheen. This was observed to evaporate and disperse completely within days of the settlement. Overall DECC considers the environmental impact of the incident to be localised and minimal. TOTAL are now executing their plan to put cement plugs in place and totally secure the well, currently scheduled for completion by mid-September, before finally plugging and abandoning the well. HSE, DECC, MCA, Marine Scotland and the Elgin Government Interest and Environment Groups continue to closely monitor and assess the situation."

It was first observed at 13.50 on Tuesday 28 August and size of the sheen was estimated to be between 32 tonnes and 132 tonnes of oil. Aerial observations today (29 August) at 14.35 hours estimated between 5 tonnes and 34 tonnes of oil. On 24 August Talisman reported a minor leak from the Galley subsea field to Tartan Alpha Installation pipeline. This is a 26 km pipeline in a water depth of 147metres which transports produced fluids from the Galley field for processing on the Tartan Alpha installation. Talisman has stated that the hydrocarbon content of the fluid isolated in the pipeline was approximately 14-15%. At the time the leak was identified the pipeline was depressurised and isolated. DECC were notified of this release and Talisman monitored the leak point using a remotely operated vehicle. The leak rate of emulsified fluid containing oil, gas and water was estimated at 4 kilograms per hour. The total fluid released from the Galley pipeline has been reported to DECC as approximately 14 tonnes of which 2 tonnes is oil. On 28 August Talisman were preparing to commence flushing of the Galley subsea pipeline to the Tartan Alpha platform, when the oil sheen was spotted by a surveillance aircraft. The source of the sheen has not been identified and samples of the oil have been taken for analysis. At this time there is no evidence to indicate an ongoing release of oil. Nearby installations contacted by DECC confirmed that no potential sources of the sheen (topside or subsea) had been identified. Talisman are reporting that the source of the oil is not related to the Galley subsea pipeline. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency and Marine Scotland have both been notified and DECC will continue to monitor and investigate the situation. The incident will be subject to a full investigation by DECC.  "

The summary note presents headline findings from the first wave of the survey. The survey will run four times a year, with questions on issues where we think attitudes might shift quickly or be affected by seasonal changes repeated quarterly, and others asked annually. The first wave of data was collected between 21st and 25th March 2012 using face-to-face in-home interviews with a representative sample of 2,121 households in the UK. The value of a tracking survey is in looking at how the attitudes change over time so the full value of the findings will only be apparent when we have a number of waves of data.

Energy Trends covers statistics on energy production and consumption, in total and by fuel, and provides an analysis of the year on year changes, and now includes a section on renewables. Quarterly Energy Prices covers prices to domestic and industrial consumers, prices of oil products and comparisons of international fuel prices. The main points for the first quarter of 2012 are: Indigenous production of fuels in the UK fell by 11.6 per cent in the first quarter of 2012 compared with a year earlier. Production of oil fell by 13.0 per cent whilst gas fell by 14.1 per cent as a result of maintenance work and slowdowns on a number of fields. Total primary energy consumption for energy uses fell by 2.3 per cent. However, when adjusted to take account of weather differences between 2011 and 2012, primary energy consumption fell by 1.1 per cent. Of electricity generated in the first quarter of 2012, gas accounted for 27 per cent (its lowest share in the last fourteen years) due to high gas prices, whilst coal accounted for 42 per cent. Nuclear generation accounted for 17 per cent of total electricity generated in the first quarter of 2012, a decrease from the 19 per cent share in the first quarter of 2011. Onshore wind showed the highest absolute increase in generation in the first quarter of 2012, increasing by 51 per cent, from 2.4 TWh in the first quarter of 2011 to 3.6 TWh, as a result of much increased capacity. Large increases in generation were also seen in hydro (up 43 per cent - due to high winter rainfall), offshore wind (up 50 per cent) and bioenergy (up 21 per cent due in part to the conversion of Tilbury B to dedicated biomass). In addition, an article on renewables in 2011 (page 49 of Energy Trends) shows that renewable energy accounted for 3.8 per cent of energy consumption compared to 3.2 per cent in 2010, as measured against the 2009 EU Renewable Energy Directive.

/government/news/decc-hq-slashes-energy-use,"The Department of Energy and Climate Change has been awarded a new, improved Display Energy Certificate (DEC) rating of ‘C’ for its headquarters… DECC HQ slashes energy use  Closed organisation: Department of Energy & Climate Change The Department of Energy and Climate Change has been awarded a new, improved Display Energy Certificate (DEC) rating of ‘C’ for its headquarters building. A DEC is measure of the energy efficiency of a building, which is rated on a scale of A to G, with A being the most efficient and G being the least. On moving into 3 Whitehall Place in Autumn 2008, it had a ‘G’ rating.  Since then DECC has made improving its energy efficiency and carbon emissions a priority, including the publication of its first ever Carbon Management Plan in July 2011. Greg Barker, Minister of State for Climate Change said: “The new higher DEC rating of “C” represents a great achievement for the Department over the last four years. Only 23% of commercial buildings are rated C or above.” “Since 2008, the Department has cut its HQ building’s energy consumption by 60% and slashed carbon emissions by half. This is even more impressive when you consider that staff numbers in the building have risen since DECC took it on.” “With the right commitment, large organisations can make a big difference to their overheads and to their environmental impact, and DECC’s achievement is proof of that.” Based on current energy prices, we estimate to have saved around £156,000 in 2011/12 on energy bills as a result of the savings achieved, and expect to see even higher savings in 2012/13. The Department has mainly achieved its new and improved rating through various building management projects, including: the introduction of more occupancy controls on lighting in the building: the installation of intelligent boiler load optimisation control units to two gas-fired boilers and; the installation of variable speed drives to supply fans.  The new DEC rating runs out in July 2013.  In order to maintain this rating, there are a number of energy saving projects planned for the coming year that are estimated to shave a further 4% of the footprint of 3 Whitehall Place. To find out more about our carbon saving projects planned until March 2015, please refer to DECC’s revised Carbon Management Plan, published today .

This document summarises DECC’s performance against the GGC targets for the 2011/12 financial year. Notes for editors A DEC is a mandatory requirement for all public buildings over 1,000 m² and must be displayed in a prominent place.   The DEC rating of 3 Whitehall Place has steadily improved with a G rating in 2008, an F rating in 2009, E rating in 2010, D rating in 2011 and a C rating in 2012. DECC achieved a B rating for its other main building, 55 Whitehall, in January 2012. The building had a D rating when DECC took it over in April 2011.

Energy Trends covers statistics on energy production and consumption, in total and by fuel, and provides an analysis of the year on year changes, and now includes a section on renewables. Quarterly Energy Prices covers prices to domestic and industrial consumers, prices of oil products and comparisons of international fuel prices. The main points for the second quarter of 2012 are: Indigenous production of fuels in the UK fell by 10.1 per cent in the second quarter of 2012 compared with a year earlier. Oil production fell by 12.2 per cent and natural gas production fell by 13.9; these falls were due to maintenance activity and slowdowns on a number of fields. Total primary energy consumption for energy uses rose by 6.3 per cent. However, when adjusted to take account of weather differences between the second quarter of 2011 and the second quarter of 2012, primary energy consumption rose by 0.8 per cent. Final energy consumption rose by 5.1 per cent, with domestic consumption up 32.8 per cent; domestic consumption in the second quarter of 2011 was particularly low due to warmer weather last year. Total deliveries of the key transport fuels were down 6.3 per cent when compared to the same period last year. Motor spirit deliveries fell by 10.6 per cent, with deliveries in April 2012 particularly low following a substantial increase in March 2012 in anticipation of a potential tanker drivers’ strike. Of electricity generated in the second quarter of 2012, gas accounted for 29.8 per cent (its lowest second quarter share in the last fourteen years) due to high gas prices, whilst coal accounted for 36.1 per cent (its highest second quarter share in the last fourteen years). Renewables’ share of electricity generation increased to 9.6 per cent from the 9.0 per cent share in the second quarter of 2011. Hydro generation decreased by 31.3 per cent on the second quarter of 2011 as a result of low rainfall. Over the same period, offshore wind generation increased by 46.7 per cent, whilst onshore wind generation fell by 11.4 per cent. Overall renewable generation was up 6.5 per cent compared to the same quarter in 2011. Domestic electricity prices, including VAT, were 5.5 per cent higher in real terms than in the same period last year, whilst domestic gas prices were 13.0 per cent higher. For the period July to December 2011, prices for industrial electricity consumers, including taxes, were above the EU15 median for medium, large and extra-large consumers, but below the median for small consumers. Prices for industrial gas consumers were the lowest in the EU15 for all consumers. Due to a delay in publication of the data by Eurostat, we do not have international comparisons for first 6 months of 2012.

/government/news/statement-on-osprey-field,"Fairfield Energy Limited has advised DECC that whilst conducting ROV operations at the Osprey subsea manifold, another ongoing small leak has… Statement on Osprey Field  Closed organisation: Department of Energy & Climate Change Fairfield Energy Limited has advised DECC that whilst conducting ROV operations at the Osprey subsea manifold, another ongoing small leak has been discovered at one of the 8” oil flowlines downstream of the production manifold. Although the line is depressurised a small amount of oil bubbles are continuing to float to the sea surface. Fairfield therefore intend to flush the 8” test and production lines with seawater back to the Dunlin installation on Friday 27 July 2012. This is in order to remove all the oil from the pipelines which should stop the oil bubbles floating to the surface. For clarification, Fairfield has to date notified DECC of oil releases from three locations; the P3 well head which is now isolated, the manifold which is now releasing very small amounts of gas and from one of the 8” flowlines. The maximum volume of oil released to sea is to date 13.8 tonnes. DECC continues to monitor the incident and is in daily contact with Fairfield Energy Limited.   Update: 25 July 2012 Fairfield Energy Limited have advised DECC that they undertook subsea operations on Friday 20 July to isolate the P3 well from the Osprey system and the oil leak identified as coming from the subsea infrastructure in the vicinity of the P3 was stopped. During the isolation operations a secondary small oil leak from the vicinity of the Osprey production manifold was observed. In the period from Friday 20 July to Tuesday 24 July Fairfield have notified DECC that an additional 0.19 tonnes of oil has been released to sea with a small visible surface sheen. This oil sheen has been observed to be dispersing naturally. Production from the Osprey and Merlin fields has been shut down and the system depressurised.  Fairfield have advised DECC that ROV inspections will commence on Wednesday 25 July in an attempt to ascertain the exact location of the small ongoing  oil leak to facilitate the necessary repairs. The total maximum volume of oil released to sea during this incident has been reported to DECC as 11.25 tonnes. This incident presents no risk to personnel. Fairfield have provided DECC with an Environmental Impact Assessment which confirms the oil released to sea will have minimal environmental impact. DECC continues to monitor this incident.  Update: 16 July 2012 Fairfield Energy Limited has advised DECC that an ROV inspection took place over the weekend and the source of the leak on the Osprey subsea structure has been found. Fairfield are currently sourcing a Diving Support Vessel (DSV) to attend the location so that work can commence to implement the necessary repairs to isolate the subsea structure. The Osprey field is still shut down and depressurised. DECC continues to monitor the situation and can confirm that very small quantities of oil are being released from the subsea manifold to the sea surface, but that this is dispersing quite quickly. Update: 14 July 2012 DECC can confirm that a hydrocarbon spill was reported in the vicinity of the Osprey subsea manifold that feeds back to the Dunlin Alpha installation at approximately 8.30pm on Tuesday 10 July. The Dunlin Alpha installation, which is located in the North Sea 195km north-east of Shetland, is operated by Fairfield Energy Limited. The initial report from the operator was that up to 8.7 tonnes of oil had been released to sea and production from the Osprey field was shut down and depressurised. The installation standby vessel remains in the vicinity and aerial surveillance is being routinely undertaken. Visual observations report that there continues to be a very small ongoing release of oil coming to the sea surface but that this dispersing rapidly. Fairfield are mobilising a vessel with ROV capability to undertake a visual inspection of the manifold and other subsea infrastructure which is expected in the field this weekend. The spill presents no risk to personnel and will have no impact on the environment. All relevant authorities and the SOSREP have been notified and DECC continues to monitor this incident.  "

I published a formal consultation setting out our ambitious simplification package for the CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme. Since then we have engaged extensively with stakeholders on our proposals and received over 250 responses to our consultation. The majority of responses agreed with our proposals for simplifying the scheme and welcomed the package of simplification proposals. The Department will now publish a formal Government response to our consultation. Our simplification package for CRC will radically reduce the administrative costs to participants by over half (55%), which will deliver around £272m savings for CRC participants up to 2030. The package will reduce both the complexity of the scheme and its overlap with other climate legislation, without undermining its energy efficiency objectives. We have also gone further in a number of our simplifications. We have reduced the number of fuels that participants need to report to two, to reflect the fact that electricity and gas make up the vast majority of the CRC’s emissions coverage. We are also introducing an assumption that all gas used is for heating purposes and a 2% de minimis threshold on gas (for heating), reducing the reporting burden for organisations with very low gas consumption. I understand participants’ concerns around the Performance League Table and have decided to abolish it. Participants’ aggregated energy use and emissions data will continue to be made public annually in line with the Government’s transparency agenda, which will ensure that CRC participants’ energy efficiency behaviour remains visible. We are also bringing in a number of simplifications in advance of the beginning of Phase Two of the CRC, which will both help to reduce the administrative burden and allow participants to feel the benefits of simplification earlier. The key proposals which will be bought in for the last two years of Phase One (2012-13 and 2013-14) are the reduction in fuels reported and the de minimis on gas, both of which will reduce the complexity of the scheme immediately. Our simplification package optimises the projected energy and carbon savings delivered by the CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme while reducing its complexity and administrative cost. I will lay the necessary Statutory Instrument to implement the simplification package for the CRC Scheme before the House shortly."

North Sea oil sheen reported  Closed organisation: Department of Energy & Climate Change North Sea sheen update 30 August 2012 Oil samples taken from a sheen observed in the North Sea 160km North East of St. Fergus and analysed by Talisman have found that it does not come from the nearby Galley field operated by the company. Aerial surveillance this afternoon estimates the maximum amount of oil in the sheen at four tonnes, indicating that it is rapidly dispersing naturally. The source of the sheen remains unknown with installations in the area reporting that operations remain normal. DECC is continuing to investigate and monitor the situation in cooperation with the Maritime and Coastguard Agency and Marine Scotland.   Statement by DECC 29 August 2012 An oil sheen has been reported in the North Sea 160km North East of St Fergus approximately 3.7 km from the pipeline connecting the Galley subsea field to the Tartan Alpha Installation, which are both operated by Talisman Energy (UK) Limited. It was first observed at 13.50 on Tuesday 28 August and size of the sheen was estimated to be between 32 tonnes and 132 tonnes of oil. Aerial observations today (29 August) at 14.35 hours estimated between 5 tonnes and 34 tonnes of oil. On 24 August Talisman reported a minor leak from the Galley subsea field to Tartan Alpha Installation pipeline. This is a 26 km pipeline in a water depth of 147metres which transports produced fluids from the Galley field for processing on the Tartan Alpha installation. Talisman has stated that the hydrocarbon content of the fluid isolated in the pipeline was approximately 14-15%. At the time the leak was identified the pipeline was depressurised and isolated. DECC were notified of this release and Talisman monitored the leak point using a remotely operated vehicle. The leak rate of emulsified fluid containing oil, gas and water was estimated at 4 kilograms per hour. The total fluid released from the Galley pipeline has been reported to DECC as approximately 14 tonnes of which 2 tonnes is oil. On 28 August Talisman were preparing to commence flushing of the Galley subsea pipeline to the Tartan Alpha platform, when the oil sheen was spotted by a surveillance aircraft. The source of the sheen has not been identified and samples of the oil have been taken for analysis. At this time there is no evidence to indicate an ongoing release of oil. Nearby installations contacted by DECC confirmed that no potential sources of the sheen (topside or subsea) had been identified. Talisman are reporting that the source of the oil is not related to the Galley subsea pipeline. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency and Marine Scotland have both been notified and DECC will continue to monitor and investigate the situation. The incident will be subject to a full investigation by DECC.  "

Hard to fill cavity walls in British homes: study (1st report)  Closed organisation: Department of Energy & Climate Change This report is an update on an earlier report by Inbuilt and Davis Langdon published on our web site at the end of 2010 which gave an estimate for the first time of the number of hard to fill cavity walls in Great Britain. The updated report has revised the original estimated range of hard to fill cavity walls in the 2010 report (3.9 to 5.8 million) to a range of 2.5 to 3.6 million. The update is based on an improved methodology, including using the 2008 English Housing Survey instead of 2007. The estimate has come down in part due to dialogue with industry stakeholders concerning the number of narrow cavity walls. The update also breaks down the hard to fill group into several smaller categories with an estimated range given for each. These changes have been reflected in the Green Deal and Energy Company Obligation impact assessments and should be useful in continuing to design effective policies to improve insulation in the housing stock of Great Britain.

The Energy Act 2008 gave the Secretary of State powers to amend existing, or create new, licence conditions and industry codes for the purposes of delivering the Smart Meter Implementation Programme . In April 2012, the Government explained that it was minded to place a specific obligation on suppliers in relation to the security of their end-to-end smart metering systems, through a new licence condition. The intention is that this obligation would cover the period until the Data and Communications Company (DCC) starts to provide services, when there will need to be different arrangements in place. This condition will require suppliers to be responsible for the end-to-end security of their smart metering systems. In fulfilling this obligation, the Government stated that suppliers might also be required to conduct a risk assessment of their end-to-end systems and to have an annual security risk audit conducted by suitably qualified, independent, external specialists. This document presents and considers the specific licence obligations for these existing Government proposals for this early period.

/government/news/industry-agree-stretching-energy-efficiency-targets-with-government,"The new CCA scheme has started, providing an extension to the Climate Change Levy rebate for energy intensive industries until 2023  Industry agree stretching energy efficiency targets with government  Environment Agency Closed organisation: Department of Energy & Climate Change Press Notice 2013/034 UK Energy Intensive Industries have agreed to commit to stretching energy efficiency improvement targets to 2020 as part of the voluntary Climate Change Agreements (CCA) scheme. This will deliver an overall 11.0% energy efficiency improvement across all industry sectors by 2020 against agreed baselines. The new Climate Change Agreements scheme started yesterday, and shall provide an extension to the Climate Change Levy rebate for energy intensive industries until 2023 in return for meeting energy efficiency improvement targets. The Environment Agency shall administer the new scheme, providing a simplified and streamlined approach to administration for both Government and Industry. A total of 51 industrial sectors including steel, aerospace and farming have signed up across 9,000 sites. Gregory Barker, Minister for Climate Change, said: “I am really impressed by the commitment shown by the UK Energy Intensive Industry to improving their competitiveness and energy efficiency. This partnership with Government demonstrates our commitment to growth” These savings will be delivered through the implementation of cost-effective measures such as high efficiency motors, variable speed drivers, energy efficient boilers, improved energy management systems and process optimisation. If all the sectors meet their targets from 2013 to 2020 against agreed baselines, this would: Reduce emissions of carbon dioxide by 19 million tonnes; Reduce primary energy consumption by approximately 100TWh; Deliver an estimated saving to participants on the Climate Change Levy of £300 million each year. Ray Gluckman, chair of the CCA Working Group of the UK Emissions Trading Group (ETG) said: “The ETG appreciates the extensive consultation undertaken by DECC on this important element of climate change and energy efficiency policy. This has enabled industry to work with Government and the EA to help streamline and improve the operation of CCAs. The targets are challenging but provide industry with some degree of certainty over the goals to be achieved over the next 8 years.” Notes for Editors All the sector targets that have been agreed are listed below. The estimates above are indicative as they assume that productivity levels and fuel mixes will remain the same as in 2008. The estimated Climate Change Levy discount is not an official forecast. Estimated saving to participants on the Climate Change Levy of £300 million each year does not take into account the Mineralogical and Metallurgical industries’ exemption from the Climate Change Levy announced in the Budget on 20th March 2013. The Government will look very closely at the impact the proposed metallurgical and mineralogical process exemptions will have on the CCAs scheme and carefully consider retaining a link with CCA energy efficiency targets, as some in industry have suggested. Participation in Climate Change Agreements is voluntary and is open to the most energy intensive industries. Eligible sectors can receive up to 90% reduction in the Climate Change Levy if they sign up to stretching energy efficiency targets agreed with Government. The Government announced in Budget 2011 that a simpler Climate Change Agreement scheme would run from April 2013 to 2023 providing certainty for industry and encouraging long-term investment in energy-saving strategies which are good for growth and UK competitiveness. Sector targets are set at percentage values energy efficiency improvement. They will be reviewed in 2016, with a view to assessing the progress made by each sector. The target setting process used evidence templates completed by industry, setting out technological potential and what was cost effective to establish challenging energy efficiency targets for sectors which were realistic to deliver by 2020. CCL discount for electricity under the CCA scheme will increase from 65% to 90% from 1 April 2013.

The Energy Act 2011 included provisions for a special administration regime for energy supply companies, similar to that already in place for electricity and gas transmission and network distribution companies. Special administration regimes are an alternative to general insolvency law and procedures. They are generally designed to ensure uninterrupted and safe operation of essential services in the event of a company becoming insolvent. The provisions in the Energy Act set out the broad legal framework for energy supply company administration. The draft rules set out in detail how energy supply company administration will operate in practice and are similar to those already in place for ordinary administration. The draft Rules apply only to companies which the courts in England and Wales have jurisdiction to wind up. Separate rules are being prepared for companies which the courts in Scotland have jurisdiction to wind up. These will be published for consultation on our website later in the summer.

/government/news/new-biomass-sustainability-criteria-to-provide-certainty-for-investors-to-2027,"From April 2015 biomass industry must show fuel is sustainable or lose financial support New biomass sustainability criteria to provide certainty for investors to 2027  Closed organisation: Department of Energy & Climate Change Biomass electricity will produce over 70% greenhouse gas savings compared to fossil fuel alternatives, under changes made by the government to ensure the sustainability of wood-fuel used to create energy. From April 2015, the biomass industry – which is worth over £1bn in new investment and supports over 3,000 jobs – will be required to demonstrate their fuel is sustainable or lose financial support. Greg Barker, Minister of State for Energy and Climate Change, said: “The Coalition is committed to delivering clean, affordable and secure energy for consumers. “This includes an important role for biomass power as part of the UK’s energy mix. “The new criteria will provide the necessary investor certainty and, crucially, ensure that the biomass is delivered in a transparent and sustainable way.” The tough new criteria for sustainable forest management are based on a range of issues such as: sustainable harvesting rates, biodiversity protection and land use rights for indigenous populations. Organisations who do not comply with the new requirements could see financial support withheld. All generators of 1 Megawatt (MW) capacity or more using solid biomass or biogas feedstock will be required to demonstrate that they are meeting the criteria in order to claim support under the Renewables Obligation. This would cover around 98% of all biomass power generation in the UK. We are also today introducing a new requirement for generators of 1MW capacity and above to provide an independent sustainability audit with their annual sustainability report. Today’s announcement will help bring forward transitional biomass technologies such as coal to biomass conversions which are one of the quickest and most cost effective ways to help decarbonise the UK’s electricity supply. To provide the certainty that investors and developers need there will be no further unilateral changes to the sustainability criteria before April 2027. Notes for Editors: By 2020 biomass generators of 1MW and above will have to meet a 200 kg CO2eq per MWh annual target (72% saving compared to the EU fossil fuel electricity average). This reduces further to a 180 kg CO2eq per MWh from 2025 (75% saving compared to the EU fossil fuel electricity average). A threshold of 1MW and above covers around 98% of biomass power generation. The other 2% (those with a capacity between 50kW and 1MW) will be required to report against the criteria, but not to comply with it. Microgeneration (under 50kW) are not included in the scope. Biomass is expected to make a significant contribution to delivering the UK’s 2020 renewable energy target. Around 38% of our renewable electricity comes from bioenergy. Sustainable forest management criteria will be based on the Government’s UK Timber Procurement Policy Principles Mandatory sustainability criteria have already been introduced to the RO for bioliquids as required by the EU Renewable Energy Directive (RED). We have introduced a cap of 400MW on the total new-build dedicated biomass capacity (excludes biomass with CHP and coal to biomass conversions) that can expect grandfathered support under the RO. We are using a notification process to allocate places within the cap. This is now open for applications for priority projects (that reached financial close by 20 August). Other projects will be able to apply from 11 September onwards."

/government/publications/how-trends-in-appliances-affect-domestic-co2-emissions-a-review-of-home-and-garden-appliances,"Research carried out for DECC by Loughborough University and Nottingham University Business School. How trends in appliances affect domestic CO2 emissions: a review of home and garden appliances  Closed organisation: Department of Energy & Climate Change This review, commissioned by DECC in 2009, set out to review and collate data to provide an evidence base to domestic appliance usage, and to look for evidence of trends affecting future consumption in the home. A household perspective was taken, rather than considering the energy use of individual appliances used in DEFRA’s Market Transformation Programme models. The study aimed to draw together information about the energy demands of current domestic appliance use at a household level, and explore trends in future use, in order to predict future demands. This information could then be used to inform future household models that include an element of appliance modelling, building on existing knowledge, and so issues relating to household appliance modelling were also considered to ensure any data were reviewed in context. This review covered all domestic appliances within the home that could easily be removed (i.e. with a plug), although in some cases it was not easy to isolate only these appliances from data sources. All items that use energy within the garden were also included in the review (e.g. garden power tools, pond filters, security and decorative lighting) to gain a better understanding of this aspect of home energy use. Additional information in areas of user behaviour and the whole-house perspective was also sought, including data from a concurrent research study led by Loughborough University (4M) which provided data on household appliance ownership and usage. The report highlighted that significant studies of appliance ownership, usage and measured power consumption did not exist, although pockets of data were available, some very specific to a small survey or appliance sub-group; others studies were more general market research data focused on sales. Since the study was completed, additional data to fill these gaps has been provided by the Household Electricity Survey: A study of domestic electrical product usage published in 2012."

/government/news/uk-energy-statistics-statistical-press-release,"Energy trends and Quarterly energy prices published. UK energy statistics: statistical press release - March 2013  Closed organisation: Department of Energy & Climate Change Press Release 2013/030 Energy Trends and Quarterly Energy Prices publications are published today 28 March 2013 by the Department of Energy and Climate Change. The publications cover new data for the fourth quarter of 2012 and thus provisional annual data for 2012. This press release focuses on the 2012 annual data. Energy Trends covers statistics on energy production and consumption, in total and by fuel, and provides an analysis of the year on year changes. Quarterly Energy Prices covers prices to domestic and industrial consumers, prices of oil products and comparisons of international fuel prices. The key points from 2012 are: Total energy production was 10½ per cent lower than in 2011, due to the significant falls in oil and gas production as a result of maintenance activity, as well as longer-term decline on the UK Continental Shelf. Imports in 2012 were at a record high, with exports at their lowest level since 1989. Net import dependency rose to 43 per cent, the highest level since 1976. Total primary energy consumption for energy uses rose by 2½ per cent from 2011. When adjusted to take account of weather differences between 2011 and 2012, primary consumption fell by under ½ per cent. Final energy consumption was 2 per cent higher than in 2011. Of electricity generated in 2012, coal accounted for 39½ per cent (an increase of 9 percentage points on 2011) and gas 27½ per cent (a decrease of 13 percentage points on 2011), mainly due to high gas prices. Renewables’ share of generation increased by 2 percentage points on 2011 to a record 11½ per cent. Average annual household standard electricity bills (fixed consumption of 3,300 kWh per annum) across all payment types in 2012 are £26 higher than in 2011 (up 5.7 per cent to £479), and average gas bills (fixed consumption of 18,000 kWh per annum) across all payment types are £81 higher (up 11.3 per cent to £800). Other highlights from 2012 include: Oil production was 14½ per cent lower than in 2011, the lowest annual production volume since our current reporting system began. Production of petroleum products was down 8½ per cent, with the closure of Coryton in July 2012 a key factor. Natural gas production was 14 per cent lower than in 2011, and at its lowest level since 1985. Gas exports and imports were, respectively, 21½ per cent and 6½ per cent lower than in 2011. Coal production was 10 per cent lower than in 2011. Coal imports were 37½ per cent higher. Generators’ demand for coal was higher by 31 per cent. Coal stocks were 18 per cent lower, and at a record low for the year end. Within final energy consumption there were rises in all sectors except transport. Domestic consumption rose by 10 per cent due to the cooler weather in 2012, with temperatures in 2012 being 1.0 degrees cooler than 2011. On a seasonally and temperature adjusted basis final energy consumption was broadly unchanged. Gas demand was 5½ per cent lower than in 2011, largely driven by the fall in gas demand for electricity generation. Electricity consumption was under ½ per cent lower than in 2011 and at its lowest level since 1998. Electricity generated in 2012 fell by 1 per cent, from 367.8 TWh a year earlier to 363.2 TWh. Low carbon electricity’s share of generation increased from 28 per cent in 2011 to 30½ per cent in 2012, due to higher renewables and nuclear generation. Nuclear’s share of generation increased by 1 percentage point on 2011, to 19½ per cent of the total. Hydro generation decreased by 8 per cent on 2011 as a result of lower rainfall in the main hydro areas, whilst wind rose by 31½ per cent, of which offshore wind rose by 45½ per cent, due to increased capacity. Overall hydro and wind generation was 21 per cent higher than in 2011. UK domestic gas and electricity prices are the lowest and fifth lowest in the EU15 respectively. The price for coal paid by generators fell by 17 per cent, whilst the price for gas rose by 11½ per cent in 2012 compared to 2011. The March 2013 edition of Energy Trends also includes articles on: Coal in 2012 Domestic energy bills in 2012: The impact of variable consumption Petrol and diesel prices Long-term mean temperatures 1981-2010 DECC and the new Government website UKCS capital expenditure survey 2012 The full statistical release is available. !@1"

/government/news/improving-non-domestic-rhi-have-your-say,"LinkedIn discussion on ways to improve the non-domestic RHI scheme ahead of a review next year Improving non-domestic RHI: Have your say  Closed organisation: Department of Energy & Climate Change We have started a LinkedIn discussion on ways to improve the non-domestic RHI scheme ahead of a review next year. Since it was launched in November 2011 the non-domestic RHI has driven the uptake of 0.5 TWH of renewable heat and given out £21.8m in incentive payments. To date our focus for the RHI has been on maximising the cost effective deployment of renewable heat (within budget), addressing key issues and extending the scheme to other renewable heat technologies. But we feel we can do more to improve the quality and value for money the scheme offers, as well as increase the quantity of heat deployed. To help us achieve that we want your views. Tell us what works, what doesn’t and share your ideas for improvements or quick-wins. As a starter for ten we’re thinking of framing the review around three themes: Improving performance and efficiency : How to measure and evaluate the performance of non-domestic installations to make them more energy efficient over time? Developing the market : What other technologies should be included in the scheme? Simplifying the administrative burden : Can we streamline application, accreditation and reporting processes and requirements to reduce costs to industry and Government? These are just suggestions. If you have other ideas for key themes please let us know. To avoid creating uncertainty in the market there are some things we don’t plan to consider as part of the review. These include: changes to new tariffs questions about the tariff setting methodology The review will also have to align with other government plans and activities in this area. But aside from those we’re looking for good ideas to help improve all aspects of non-domestic RHI. So please take part, share your views and help us make non-domestic RHI work better for everyone. Please comment by Friday 20 December"
/government/publications/analysis-of-customer-data-from-phase-one-of-the-renewable-heat-premium-payments-rhpp-scheme,"An evaluative report of the Renewable Heat Premium Payments (RHPP) 1 scheme.  Analysis of customer data from phase one of the renewable heat premium payments (RHPP) scheme  Closed organisation: Department of Energy & Climate Change The RHPP1 scheme ran from 1st August 2011 to 31st March 2012. It was set up to support the industry and also to gather evidence for future policy development. Research was commissioned to ensure that we captured the learning in a robust and useful way. Two pieces of research were commissioned, one by DECC, and the other by the Energy Saving Trust (EST) who administered the scheme. Together they form the evaluation of the RHPP1 scheme. The report published here is an analysis, undertaken by AECOM, of two questionnaires answered by over 3,500 households who claimed an RHPP1 household voucher. The first questionnaire was answered after the installation and asks households about their motivations for installing a renewable heating technology and claiming RHPP as well as their experience of the scheme. The second questionnaire was completed after the householder had experienced at least a winter using the renewable heating technology and asked about their experiences and satisfaction of heating their home with this new technology. The questionnaires were designed by DECC and sent to householders by EST. The analysis was carried out by AECOM. The EST report is a small scale piece of qualitative research with householders and installers involved in the RHPP1 scheme. It consisted of some in-depth interviews to complement and deepen our understanding of issues around the application and installation process, and the use of technology. It was carried out by EST who commissioned the research from CAG consultants. Neither of the studies covers social landlords, community groups or tenants who have all been included in the comprehensive research now underway looking at the RHPP2 scheme. The RHPP2 research will report next year."

The Energy Act 2008 gave the Secretary of State powers to amend existing, or create new, licence conditions and industry codes for the purposes of delivering the Smart Meter Implementation Programme . In April 2012, the Government explained that it was minded to place a specific obligation on suppliers in relation to the security of their end-to-end smart metering systems, through a new licence condition. The intention is that this obligation would cover the period until the Data and Communications Company (DCC) starts to provide services, when there will need to be different arrangements in place. This condition will require suppliers to be responsible for the end-to-end security of their smart metering systems. In fulfilling this obligation, the Government stated that suppliers might also be required to conduct a risk assessment of their end-to-end systems and to have an annual security risk audit conducted by suitably qualified, independent, external specialists. This document presents and considers the specific licence obligations for these existing Government proposals for this early period.

/government/news/rhi-biomethane-injection-tariff-to-be-reviewed,"Review of Renewable Heat Incentive biomethane injection tariff to address risk of large biomethane to grid plants being overcompensated    RHI biomethane injection tariff to be reviewed  Closed organisation: Department of Energy & Climate Change The biomethane injection tariff is to be reviewed following representations from industry that there is a risk of overcompensation for large biomethane to grid plants under the current Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) biomethane injection tariff. Larger plants benefit from economies of scale which can make them efficient generators of renewable energy, but their costs may not justify support at current levels. DECC has undertaken initial analysis of the evidence underpinning the tariff and has concluded that there may be a risk of overcompensation for large plants or sites with existing assets. This represents a value for money risk for the taxpayer. It is vital that we get the level of support right so that the market can invest with confidence, RHI support is spent efficiently and the market can grow sustainably. DECC has therefore confirmed that it has initiated a review of the biomethane injection tariff. As part of the review, DECC will be updating the cost and performance data underpinning the tariff to determine whether any changes are required. If it is concluded that changes are needed, DECC plans to consult on these in the summer. Further information Renewable Heat Incentive (policy) RHI guide for businesses"

/government/news/register-your-biomass-fuel-as-sustainable,"From today, woodfuel suppliers will be able to register their fuels as sustainable by applying to the Biomass Suppliers List (BSL). Register your biomass fuel as sustainable  Closed organisation: Department of Energy & Climate Change From today, woodfuel suppliers will be able to register their fuels as sustainable by applying to the Biomass Suppliers List (BSL). This is a first for the UK biomass sector and a major milestone in ensuring biomass supported under the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) is sustainable. The BSL will help develop the growing market for renewable heat providing opportunities throughout the supply chain. Producers and traders of woodfuel who wish to access the growing RHI market can apply for free to the BSL (1). Small and micro enterprises will be able to use a new simple carbon calculator developed to make the process as easy as possible for small businesses. Larger enterprises will be able to use the UK Solid and Gaseous Biomass and Biogas Carbon Calculator to calculate the GHG emissions associated with their fuel. Individuals and businesses that self-supply their own fuel are also encouraged to register as ‘self-supplier’ (2) as soon as possible. From Autumn 2014 all biomass fuel used by households, businesses and other organisations claiming the RHI must meet a lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions target of 60 per cent and GHG savings against the EU fossil fuel average (3). The BSL was developed and will be run by Gemserv, partnering with Woodsure, HETAS and Borough IT. Notes Producers and producer-traders should apply as early as possible. Traders may wish to encourage their producers to apply to the list before making their own applications, as this is likely to make it easier for traders to apply. RHI participants will be able to register on the Biomass Suppliers List (BSL) as a ‘self-supplier’ if their installation is less than 1MWth capacity, and if they source fuel from the same estate as the boiler. Self-suppliers will also be able to source waste woodfuel from outside their estate for use in their installation. For the purposes of self-supply in the BSL, an estate comprises the buildings and supporting land and woods that is owned by, or has the legal rights to source from, one person, a family, an organisation, a single farm business or a commercial business. The land and buildings may or may not be contiguous but should be within reasonable distance of the boiler. A reasonable distance is defined as follows: the biomass source must be within 50 miles of the boiler. The public facing list of authorised fuels will be made available to consumers once a sufficient proportion of traders have registered their fuels and their applications have been processed. We expect this to be later this Spring, although it will depend on the rate and distribution of applications, and will ensure the public facing list is made available sufficiently ahead of the regulations coming into force."

UK summary of analysis on 2030 GHG targets  Closed organisation: Department of Energy & Climate Change DECC has published a policy summary on UK analysis on EU 2030 targets, which is also accompanied by a one page set of high level findings on 2030 Analysis. The Enerdata Report on Costs and Benefits to EU Member States of 2030 Climate and Energy Targets has underpinned these two publications. The European Commission’s White Paper on a 2030 framework for climate and energy policies was published on 22 January 2014 alongside their Impact Assessment of costs and benefits . The UK’s response to the Commission’s prior Green Paper consultation on the 2030 framework is available. DECC commissioned Enerdata to model the impacts of a range of 2030 targets which cover the EU’s climate and energy framework. The results provide an EU-wide and Member State level assessment of the costs and some benefits of different target options. The analysis was developed using POLES – a long-term, energy-economy model jointly developed by Enerdata, the University of Grenoble, and the EC-JRC IPTS (with key economic assumptions based on credible publicly available EU wide sources). Enerdata’s report is intended to provide a contribution to the policy debate on the EU 2030 framework for climate and energy policies and does not necessarily represent the UK’s or EU’s views or preferred approach. This report and the supporting documents sit alongside previously published UK analysis on 2°C consistent EU targets and the ‘Going for Green Growth’ pamphlet which sets out why the EU needs to take ambitious and immediate low carbon action. At March European Council, EU Leaders invited the Commission and Member States to rapidly develop a number of elements to support a final agreement on the EU 2030 framework as soon as possible and by no later than October 2014. The elements included analysis of the implications for individual MS of the Commission’s proposals and elaboration of mechanisms for overall fair effort sharing. To support this process and related discussions between MS, the UK circulated a non-paper ahead of July Informal Environment Council that provided analysis of the implications for MS of illustrative scenarios for effort sharing in the non-traded sector up to 2030. The paper includes cost-benefit analysis commissioned by DECC from consultants Enerdata. We believe this will support a positive and transparent discussion on the most appropriate approach and principles for effort sharing, and help MS to more fully understand the national implications. The paper does not set out the UK’s preferred approach."

/government/consultations/biomass-sustainability,"This consultation seeks views on proposed technical adjustments to sustainability provisions for solid and gaseous biomass under the Renewables Obligation (RO) and Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI). Biomass sustainability  Closed organisation: Department of Energy & Climate Change This consultation proposes minor technical adjustments to five specific aspects of the existing or planned reporting requirements and sustainability criteria for biomass, which were previously announced in August 2013 in the Government response to the consultation on proposals to enhance sustainability criteria for the use of biomass feedstocks under the Renewables Obligation (RO) . The proposals are: Proposal 1: to revise the Saw Logs definition in the Renewables Obligation (RO) Proposal 2: to reconsider the reporting requirements for tree species in the RO Proposal 3: to provide exemptions from the Timber Standard for certain categories of wood for the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) and RO Proposal 4: to add ‘highly biodiverse grasslands’ to the list of protected land types for the RHI and RO Proposal 5: averaging of Greenhouse Gas Emissions across the year in the RO All of the proposals would apply to the RO in England & Wales. Only proposals 3 and 4 would apply to the RHI in England, Scotland and Wales. It is our intention that the forthcoming FIDeR contracts and generic Contracts for Difference (CfD) awarded under the Electricity Market Reform will follow the same approach as the sustainability criteria set under the RO. We have also published a copy of the ‘Forestry Commission field book 9: classification and presentation of soft saw logs’ which is relevant to proposal 1 - to revise the definition of saw logs in the RO (see paragraphs 3.4 to 3.8 of the consultation document)."

/government/news/response-to-sunday-telegraph-coverage-of-constraint-payments-report,"Response to Sunday Telegraph coverage of Renewable Energy Foundation report on constraint payments. Response to Sunday Telegraph coverage of constraint payments report  Closed organisation: Department of Energy & Climate Change Constraint payments are nothing new. National Grid has been paying coal and gas generators - and others - to change their planned output well before wind farms joined the mix. These payments are made when power cannot be transmitted to where it is needed, usually due to congestion at a certain point on the network. When this happens, National Grid needs to take action to ‘balance’ energy supply and demand, and ensure the lights stay on. The payments are made on a competitive bid basis to ensure that these costs are as low as possible. But when constraint costs would be higher than the cost of building new network capacity, those network reinforcements are being made instead. We tightened the rules in 2012 so generators cannot profit unfairly during constraint periods. Since then, prices paid to generators to curtail wind have more than halved."

Woodfuel guidance for providing bespoke evidence  Closed organisation: Department of Energy & Climate Change Heat and electricity generators under the RO, RHI and CfD schemes are required to meet the land and sustainable forest management criteria for wood, as set out in the Timber Standard for Heat and Electricity. The requirement for evidence can be met either through the use of wood that is suitably certified (known as ‘Category A’ evidence) or through the use of bespoke evidence (known as ‘Category B’ evidence). We have prepared three guidance documents to advise how these sustainability requirements can be met: The Woodfuel Advice Note provides an overview of the Timber Standard and where to find further information. The Mass Balance document sets out how suppliers may operate a mass balance system which complies with the sustainability requirements. The Checklist for Regional Supply Base Evaluation suggests the kinds of bespoke evidence that would be acceptable in meeting sustainability requirements. We would be pleased if stakeholders would feedback constructive technical comments and recommendations on these documents to cpet@efeca.com . In particular we are keen to understand if these case studies helpfully reflect your experiences of the supply chain. We will be receiving feedback on these guidance documents for a three week period, 9 September 2014 to 26 September 2014. We anticipate publishing final guidance in October.

Life cycle impacts of biomass electricity in 2020  Closed organisation: Department of Energy & Climate Change Bioenergy is expected to contribute significantly to the UK’s renewable energy and carbon targets in the future. However, bioenergy is a complex scientific topic and there remains uncertainty associated with the actual carbon impacts of different biomass feedstocks. The UK government is therefore committed to continually updating our evidence base to stay on top of the science. One area that has been identified as requiring further work is the impact of bioenergy on forest carbon stocks. The Biomass Emissions and Counterfactual (BEAC) model and report have therefore been developed to address the need for further analysis associated with bioenergy greenhouse gas intensities. The work assesses the potential availability of different North American biomass feedstocks in 2020, along with their greenhouse gas intensities and energy input requirements when used for electricity generation in the UK."

Woodfuel Guidance  Closed organisation: Department of Energy & Climate Change Those using biomass to produce heat or electricity will have to comply with mandatory sustainability critera to receive incentives, once the 2015 amended renewable obligation and renewable heat incentive orders come into force (and from April under the CFD). These criteria include a greenhouse gas and a land criteria. This guidance sets out the land criteria for those producing heat and electricity from woodfuel. For woodfuel, the land criteria is as set out in the timber standard for heat and electricity. This requires woodfuel users to put in place sustainable forest management practices, and to provide evidence that wood can be traced from a sustainable source. The guidance is split into three documents. The woodfuel advice note is the main document, with other useful detail provided in the other documents: The woodfuel advice note provides a helpful summary of all the requirements for complying with the timber standard, what other requirements to be aware of, and where to find further information (including CPET, BSL, Ofgem). The consignments and mass balance approach document sets out how suppliers should operate a ‘mass balance’ system and how sustainability data reported to Ofgem should be disaggregated into ‘consignments’. The risk based regional assessment: a checklist approach document describes how to use a checklist approach to operate a risk based regional assessment, and the kinds of bespoke evidence that would be acceptable in meeting sustainability requirements. Further sources of information: Woodfuel guidance for providing bespoke evidence . Ofgem can help answer enquiries regarding the RO scheme and RHI (domestic and non-domestic) application and reporting processes. Ofgem also provides advice on enquiries regarding fuel classification. The biomass suppliers list (BSL) offer advice and support for those wishing to supply to RHI participants. The central point of expertise on timber (CPET) offer a helpline service providing information and guidance to suppliers and generators of woodfuel on how they can comply with the woodfuel land criteria as set out in the timber standard. The forestry commission provides information on management plans, felling licences and sustainable forest management practices. The UK forestry standard (UKFS) is the reference standard for sustainable forest management in the UK. The UKFS, supported by its series of guidelines, outlines the context for forestry in the UK, sets out the approach of the UK governments to sustainable forest management, defines standards and requirements, and provides a basis for regulation and monitoring.

/government/news/new-world-refrigerator-ecodesign-investigation,"Conclusion to the NMRO investigation of energy labelling on refrigerators reveals abuses of tolerances. New world refrigerator ecodesign investigation  Closed organisation: National Measurement and Regulation Office Closed organisation: National Measurement Office Closed organisation: Department of Energy & Climate Change Closed organisation: Department for Business, Innovation & Skills The National Measurement and Regulation Office ( NMRO ) has completed an investigation in which domestic appliance manufacturer, Glen Dimplex Home Appliances, was found to be supplying an incorrect energy label on one of their models of refrigerator. An investigation undertaken by the NMRO established that the New World refrigerator (model number ILA800) was found to use an average of 14.5% more energy than declared on the label. The product was also declared to have an energy rating of ‘A+’, but could only perform to ‘A’. The company was let down by its Middle East supplier who changed the design of a refrigerator without considering the impact on the amount of energy used. Prior to NMROs intervention 1,347 units of the model had been sold; remaining stocks were quarantined during the investigation. During this time Glen Dimplex took immediate positive action, which included stopping further imports from the supplier, returning remaining stocks to the factory, testing individual models to ensure they were capable of reaching the A+ minimum efficiency requirement and implementing new processes to ensure future compliance. These actions were formalised through an enforcement undertaking; a voluntary agreement outlining specific actions to make amends for non-compliance and its effects within a specified timeframe. In recognition of the environmental impact of the additional energy usage throughout the life of the products, the company has also made a donation to the National Wildflower Centre (local to the business) as part of the enforcement undertaking to offset that impact. Glen Dimplex now has in place processes designed to ensure the ongoing accuracy of the information that they supply to consumers and that the refrigerators they supply meet and exceed the minimum requirements. Paul Argent, Supplier Quality Controller for Glen Dimplex commented: “Our experience with the officials of the National Measurement Office has been professional, courteous and informative. A good working relationship was built up during the investigation and an emphasis on fairness and co-operation made all communication easy.”"
/government/news/nmo-investigation-into-special-purpose-lamps,"Investigation into the availability, labelling, and prevalence of 'special purpose lamps' in reference to ecodesign legislation. NMRO investigation into special purpose lamps  Closed organisation: National Measurement and Regulation Office Closed organisation: National Measurement Office Closed organisation: Department of Energy & Climate Change Closed organisation: Department for Business, Innovation & Skills Ecodesign legislation is in place to promote the development of more efficient electrical products. Regulation EC No 244/2009 focuses on such requirements for non directional household lamps. The National Measurement and Regulation Office ( NMRO ) assessed the compliance of special purpose lamps and their requirements with regard to the above legislation through a market surveillance project. Lamps, marketed as special purpose do not have to comply with any ecodesign efficiency requirements. The legislation requires special purpose lamps to be suitably packaged and labelled. In order to discover if the lamps were compliant the NMRO used a combination of market research and test purchases from a variety of sources. The lamps and packaging were subsequently assessed by NMRO officers. In total 44 lamps were purchased. Analysis of these lamps and the accompanying packaging showed that manufacturers were meeting their legal obligations. The NMRO also contacted 29 businesses supplying special purpose lamps, asking them to complete an optional questionnaire. The survey was designed to help understand the industry and show likely future trends in the market. A total of 18 completed questionnaires were received. Based upon the responses it was concluded that industry felt the special purpose lamp market is diminishing due to: improved consumer trust in LED technology reducing cost of LEDs However, several businesses commented that there is no reasonable LED alternative to the 100 Watt incandescent (traditional) lamp. This research found special purpose lamps are widespread in a variety of design forms and wattages that are easily obtainable from the high street and online. The results of the market research showed that some online distributors could be adding to the misconception that special purpose lamps are suitable for household illumination due to descriptions used on their websites. The European Commission is currently in the process of evaluating lighting legislation with regard to special purpose lamps. This review is to consider the definition of special purpose lamps."

Fuel poverty, England 2013: statistical release  Closed organisation: Department of Energy & Climate Change Fuel poverty in England is measured using the Low Income High Costs (LIHC) indicator that was recommended by Professor Hills in his independent review of fuel poverty, and adopted by government in 2013. Headline statistics In 2013: The number of households in fuel poverty in England was estimated at around 2.35 million, representing approximately 10.4 per cent of all English households. This remains broadly the same as 2012, where the number of fuel poor households was 2.36 million (10.8 per cent of all English households). The aggregate fuel poverty gap reduced by around four per cent in real terms, from £909 million in 2012 to £877 million in 2013. The average fuel poverty gap over this period also decreased from £385 to £374. In 2014 a target was set to ensure that as many fuel poor homes as is reasonably practicable achieve a minimum energy efficiency rating of Band C by 2030. In 2013 five per cent of fuel poor households are living in a property with an energy efficiency rating of band C or above, which is an improvement from two per cent in 2010. !@1"
/government/news/fuel-poverty-report-shows-improvement,"The 2013 annual fuel poverty report for England was released today.  Fuel poverty report shows improvement  Closed organisation: Department of Energy & Climate Change The report analyses data from English Housing Survey to measure the impact of fuel poverty in England. A combination of rising incomes and energy efficiency improvements in low income households has seen a decrease in the fuel poverty gap from £909 million in 2012 to £877 million in 2012, with an overall reduction of £32 million. There has also been an improvement in fuel poverty levels in England from 2.36 million in 2012 to 2.35 million in 2013. These improvements are encouraging because they show that we are moving in the right direction and that by helping low income households improve their energy efficiency we can make a real difference in helping to keep their bills down.

Ferrybridge multifuel 2 power station  Closed organisation: Department of Energy & Climate Change Multifuel Energy Limited has today been given consent to construct the Ferrybridge Multifuel 2 Power Station at Knottingley, West Yorkshire. Energy Minister Lord Bourne approved the development, which during construction will bring around 500 jobs to the area, with around 35 permanent positions once operational. The power station will be capable of producing up to 90MWe of electricity, by burning fuel derived from refuse and industrial and commercial waste, such as wood, which would have originally ended up in landfill. Energy Minister Lord Bourne said: “This exciting project that will turn waste into energy is a great example of how innovation can help to power our homes and add to our energy mix “This project will offer secure energy to Britain’s hardworking families and businesses, creating jobs and financial security for working people and boosting the Northern Powerhouse”. Further information Construction of the development is likely to take approximately 3 years. Decision documentation"

The first wave of data was collected between 21 and 25 March 2012 using face-to-face in-home interviews with a representative sample of 2,121 households in the UK. The value of a tracking survey is in looking at how the attitudes change over time so the full value of the findings will only be apparent when we have a number of waves of data. Here you will find headline findings from the first wave of the survey, along with the questionnaire and a breakdown of the findings.

Energy Trends and Prices statistical release: 26 May 2016  Closed organisation: Department of Energy & Climate Change Energy production and consumption statistics are provided in total and by fuel, and provide an analysis of the latest 3 months data compared to the same period a year earlier. Energy price statistics cover domestic price indices, prices of road fuels and petroleum products and comparisons of international road fuel prices. Energy production and consumption Highlights for the 3 month period January to March 2016, compared to the same period a year earlier include: Primary energy consumption in the UK on a fuel input basis fell by 4.6%, on a temperature adjusted basis consumption fell by 2.9% continuing the downward trend. ( table ET 1.2 ) Indigenous energy production rose by 3.9%, boosted by increased UK Continental Shelf production. ( table ET 1.1 ) Electricity generation by Major Power Producers down 4.0%, with coal down 50% but offset by increase in gas up 54%.* ( table ET 5.4 ) Gas provided 40.4% of electricity generation by Major Power Producers, with renewables at 21.0%, nuclear at 20.5% and coal at a record low of 18.0%.* ( table ET 5.4 ) In March 2016 coal imports were at a record low level, despite production also being at record low levels, reflecting reduced demand from electricity generators. ( table ET 2.5 ) Wind generation by Major Power Producers down 3.8%, with offshore up 10.0% due to increased capacity, but onshore down 16.4% due to lower average wind speeds.* ( table ET 5.4 ) Low carbon share of electricity generation by Major Power Producers up 1.7 percentage points to 41.5%, due to rises in renewables, particularly bioenergy, generation.* ( table ET 5.4 ) *Major Power Producers (MPPs) data published monthly, all generating companies data published quarterly. Energy prices Highlights for May 2016 compared to April 2016: Petrol prices up 2.1 pence per litre on month whilst diesel prices up 2.4 pence per litre, these rises reflect the increase in the price of crude oil.

Finalising CRC simplification: treatment of renewable energy & the metallurgical and mineralogical sectors  Closed organisation: Department of Energy & Climate Change Our proposal is to deliver the commitment given in the Government Response on simplifying the CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme in December 2012 to consider how the CRC can incentivise the uptake of onsite renewable self-supplied electricity. In addition, to introduce an exemption to energy supplied to metallurgical and mineralogical processes, which arise from changes to the Climate Change Levy, announced by the Chancellor in the 2013 Budget. The consultation document also draws attention to a further two issues where we believe the current wording of the ‘CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme Order 2013’ is not quite right in delivering our policy intent. We are therefore proposing to amend the 2013 Order to avoid the double counting of third party energy supplies under the CRC, Climate Change Agreements and EU Emissions Trading Schemes, and allowing more flexible and greater organisational disaggregation by CRC participants. As part of our scoping work for delivering these changes, we undertook a review of the CRC Order which led to this consultation."

Cation exchange capacity (CEC) and partition coefficient (Kd) determination in landfill performance evaluation: a review of methodologies  Environment Agency LandSim is a probabilistic quantitative risk assessment model issued by the Environment Agency for use by regulatory staff in landfill performance evaluation. LandSim takes into account factors such as liner and leachate-removal system and design, and the geological and hydrogeological regimes beneath and around the site in question. Among the input values required for the model is the cation exchange capacity (CEC) of geological materials around the landfill and the partition coefficient (Kd) of key solutes in leachates. CEC can be defined as the sum of exchangeable cations that a mineral, rock or soil can adsorb at a specific pH. Kd represents overall sorption of a particular species in leachate, irrespective of process. Both CEC and Kd are critical parameters in modelling the ability over time of the geosphere to retard the migration from landfill sites of leachates in groundwater."

Forestry operations: a review of best practice guidance for the protection of the freshwater environment  Environment Agency The Environment Agency is increasingly being consulted about the adequacy of forest management practices for protecting the freshwater environment. This has led to a recognition that the Agency’s environment protection staff often lack a basic knowledge of forest operations and are unaware of the range of options and possible ameliorative measures that are available. They have also been hindered by the plethora of documentation on the subject. The objective of this project was to critically review the existing documentation on the subject of best forestry management practices for the protection of the freshwater environment and from this review to produce a practical guidance document.

/government/publications/identification-of-flood-indicators,"An alternative indicator based on hydrological and particularly extreme event data is considered more appropriate to analyse patterns of flood behaviour over time. Identification of flood indicators  Environment Agency The Environment Agency has a set of about 70 environmental indicators, which help to show how the Environment Agency is contributing to its objective of sustainable development. It is recognised that some of the indicators are not ideal and a programme of work has been started to extend improve the quality of these indicators. As part of this programme the Environment Agency needs to replace the indicator for major flooding incidents because there is no clear definition of what is a major flooding incident and it is difficult to update. An alternative indicator based on hydrological and particularly extreme event data is considered more appropriate to analyse patterns of flood behaviour over time. The aim of this project was to develop this flood indicator."
/government/publications/investigation-of-litter-problems-in-the-severn-estuarybristol-channel-area,"The report describes the primary sources of litter found on Bristol Channel beaches, tests and refines monitoring protocol and aesthetic quality assessments and evaluates public attitudes to beach quality Investigation of litter problems in the Severn Estuary/Bristol Channel area  Environment Agency Litter on Bristol Channel beaches is a very visible and aesthetically intrusive type of pollution. Litter is present, in some form, on all UK beaches, and this is certainly the case within the Bristol Channel. Beaches vary in their intensity of litter coverage from large litter sinks, such as Merthyr Mawr in south east Wales, to beaches that experience very little litter pollution, e.g. Putsborough in Devon. The Bristol Channel is a dynamic estuarine/marine environment with an extremely large tidal range (16.4m at Avonmouth), containing many beach types. Thirty-three beaches were investigated, and ‘added value’ was given to the study by an investigation of litter at 12 beaches along the mid and north Wales’ coastline, making a total of 45 beaches."
/government/publications/crude-oil-derived-petroleum-products-in-the-aquatic-environment-priorities-for-control,"The available data on the environmental fate, behaviour and toxicity of 5 groups of petroleum products is reviewed Crude oil derived petroleum products in the aquatic environment: priorities for control  Environment Agency Petroleum products are derived from crude oil and are very complex mixtures of organic chemicals which vary widely in molecular weight, physico-chemical properties, environmental fate, behaviour and toxicity. On the basis of annual production/consumption figures the most important products to man are (in this order); automotive gasoline (“petrol”), automotive diesel fuel, residual fuel oils (Nos 4, 5 and 6) and jet fuel (kerosine). Despite much lower production volumes, lubricating oils (particularly engine oils) are also very important. Of lower importance are fuel oils for domestic heating purposes (i.e. Nos 1 and 2). The increasing production volumes are broadly reflected in an increased risk of entry to aquatic ecosystems as indicated by use, storage and transport patterns."

/government/statistics/chesham-vale-buckinghamshire-groundwater-situation,"The latest update on monitored groundwater levels and whether there are any groundwater alerts or warnings in force. Chesham Vale, Buckinghamshire: groundwater situation  Environment Agency This document provides information on the groundwater situation for Chesham Vale, Buckinghamshire. Flooding from groundwater can happen when the level of water within the rock or soil that makes up the land surface (known as the water table) rises. The level of the water table changes with the seasons due to variations in long term rainfall and water abstraction. When the water table rises and reaches ground level, water starts to emerge on the surface and flooding can happen. Lead local flood authorities (the unitary or County Council) are responsible for managing the risk of flooding from groundwater. They set out how they plan to do this in their local flood risk management strategies. The Environment Agency has a strategic overview for all sources of flooding including groundwater. This means they will provide support to other risk management authorities. They supply information in the form of monitored groundwater levels. In some areas that have historically experienced groundwater flooding, the Environment Agency provide a groundwater alert or warning service."
/government/news/severn-trent-water-fined-over-pollution-of-pudding-brook,"Today, Severn Trent Water Limited pleaded guilty at Telford Magistrates’ Court to polluting the Pudding Brook in Cleobury Mortimer, Shropshire with untreated sewage.  Severn Trent Water fined over pollution of Pudding Brook  Environment Agency The company was fined £7,500 and ordered to pay £2,232.60 in costs, along with a £15 victim surcharge. The charges were brought by the Environment Agency under Regulation 38(1)(a) and Regulation 12(1)(b) of the Environmental Permitting Regulations 2010. On 29 September 2012 the Environment Agency received a report from a local resident that sewage was discharging from a manhole at Cleobury Mortimer and was consequently entering the Pudding Brook. An Environment Agency officer spoke to Severn Trent Water’s Customer Operations Centre who confirmed that another incident had been reported the previous day but they had no further details. During this telephone call the officer asked for a Severn Trent Water crew to attend the site of the pollution to investigate the claims. On arrival a camera survey by Severn Trent Water found that an electric cable had been installed incorrectly through the sewer pipe and was trapping rags and other debris leading to a blockage of the sewerage system. As a result sewage was flowing from a manhole into a drain and consequently into an adjacent stream. Downstream of the discharge the brook was cloudy in appearance and smelled of sewage and detergent whilst upstream the river was running clear. Severn Trent Water’s contractors brought in a tanker and cleared the blockage and it was agreed with onsite Environment Agency Officers that further tankering would continue so that no further discharges would occur. However, a second tanker did not arrive. On the following day it was reported to us again that sewage was still entering the stream and a further tanker was sent to site where it remained until the source of the blockage was removed and the sewer repaired. A representative for Severn Trent Water attended interview under caution and apologised for the sewage discharges and said that the decision not to obtain a further tanker was made by Severn Trent Water which in hindsight was a decision it regretted. Given that the Environment Agency was not present at the onset of the pollution it was difficult to accurately assess any impact caused. There were at least five separate sewage discharges over the three day period with potentially adverse effects causing harm to aquatic life. Had the Environment Agency been advised earlier the impact of the pollution could have been assessed and remedial action taken. In addition, had Severn Trent Water Limited followed the advice of its contractor on agreement with the Environment Agency officer and ordered a further tanker the pollution would not have continued for a further day. Speaking after the case, Adam Shipp, an Environment Agency Officer, said: This incident illustrates the importance of notifying us of an incident at the earliest opportunity. Even though on the first day of the incident Severn Trent Water had received four separate calls from members of the public telling them that sewage was entering the watercourse they failed to report anything to the Environment Agency and their contractors failed to inspect the nearby watercourse. Furthermore, a second tanker that was promised, to ensure that no further blockages occurred, was not sent to site leading to a further discharge of sewage. On a positive note, and as a result of this incident, Severn Trent Water have re-trained their staff and contractors and have ensured that all their crews now carry maps of the sewer system.”"

Flooding from groundwater can happen when the level of water within the rock or soil that makes up the land surface (known as the water table) rises. The level of the water table changes with the seasons due to variations in long term rainfall and water abstraction. When the water table rises and reaches ground level, water starts to emerge on the surface and flooding can happen. Lead local flood authorities (the unitary or County Council) are responsible for managing the risk of flooding from groundwater. They set out how they plan to do this in their local flood risk management strategies. The Environment Agency has a strategic overview for all sources of flooding including groundwater. This means they will provide support to other risk management authorities. They supply information in the form of monitored groundwater levels. In some areas that have historically experienced groundwater flooding, the Environment Agency provide a groundwater alert or warning service."
/government/news/first-enforcement-undertaking-accepted-from-water-company,"The Environment Agency has accepted an Enforcement Undertaking  from Wessex Water, in the first case where a civil sanction has been used against a water company.     First Enforcement Undertaking accepted from water company  Environment Agency The offer includes actions for Wessex Water to improve its operations and infrastructure, as well as financial contributions totalling £25,500 to environmental organisations and those affected by the offending. It follows a major pollution incident in Bristol on 11 July 2013, when a blockage in a main sewer resulted in raw sewage being discharged into the River Trym. The volume of sewage which entered the river had a large impact, with 112 eels, 200 sticklebacks, 1000 bullheads all found dead as a result of the pollution and an estimated 90% of river invertebrates also killed. The incident was reported to the Environment Agency by concerned members of the public who had seen dead and struggling fish floating on the surface of the water. Officers from the local Environment Management team responded quickly to the incident by attending site and informing Wessex Water, who took steps to stop the polluting discharge and prevent further loss of aquatic life. In the following few days, the Agency and Wessex Water continued to monitor the river, sample the water, and survey the river to fully assess the impact the pollution incident had on invertebrates and fish life. A CCTV survey of the sewer carried out by Wessex Water found that the cause of the blockage was a build-up of fat and grease, which had found its way into the system. Businesses who commit an offence under the Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries Act 1975 (SAFFA) by discharging polluting matter into a water course and kill or threaten fish and other aquatic life are able to offer an Enforcement Undertaking (EU) as an alternative to prosecution or other sanction. In any EU, the offender must offer to restore/remediate the harm caused by the offence, or where that is not possible, make a financial contribution to a recognised environmental charity or project to achieve equivalent environmental benefit. The offender must also demonstrate it will change its behaviour and ensure compliance with environmental legislation. This was accepted from Wessex Water because it was felt a more proportionate response, that would benefit the environment. Nick Hayden for the Environment Agency said: We did initially consider prosecution due to the serious environmental harm it had caused. However, the company then submitted an Enforcement Undertaking (EU), which we subsequently accepted, as we considered it was a more proportionate response and that it would achieve more for the environment than if the company had been convicted and fined. The actions offered in the accepted EU, require Wessex Water to: make improvements to its sewers in the area by installing and improving telemetry pay £15,000 to the Sustainable Eels Group, to put eels back into the affected River Trym and Bristol rivers pay £10,000 to the Bristol Avon Rivers Trust (BART) for work in the catchment pay £500 compensation to Henbury Golf Club for the impact to its business and payment of our costs. Failure to comply with an EU may result in the offender being prosecuted for the original offence. Details of Enforcement Undertakings accepted by the Environment Agency between February and May 2014 can be found on GOV.UK. Ends"

/government/news/severn-trent-water-given-10000-fine-for-pollution-in-nottinghamshire,"On Tuesday 24 June 2014, Severn Trent Water pleaded guilty at Nottingham Magistrates’ Court to one charge of pollution in Nottinghamshire. Severn Trent Water given £10,000 fine for pollution in Nottinghamshire  Environment Agency They were fined £10,000, ordered to pay £2,659.63 in costs, along with a £15 victim surcharge. The charge was brought by the Environment Agency contrary to Regulation 38(2) and 12(b) of the Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulation 2010. On 12 March 2012, Environment Agency officers attended an incident on the Potwell Dyke watercourse in Southwell, Nottinghamshire. The incident was reported by Severn Trent Water who said that water pollution had discharged into the watercourse from their combined sewer outfall. Under the terms of their environmental permit consent, Severn Trent Water were permitted to discharge into the Potwell Dyke but only during storm conditions, when flows in the overflow exceed 15 litres per second. This is to protect the downstream properties from the risk of flooding during a storm. At the time of the pollution report weather conditions were dry. On attendance officers went to the footpath just off Halloughton Road, where it was possible to see the outfall to the Potwell Dyke from Severn Trent Water’s combined sewer overflow. There was no flow from the outfall at that time, but officers observed debris around the outfall and solids on the bed of the watercourse. The water flowing down the Potwell Dyke from upstream of the outfall showed no visible signs of pollution. When officers looked at Potwell Dyke from the footbridge, downstream of Halloughton Road, the water appeared cloudy. The officers also saw dead fish in the watercourse immediately around the bridge. Both officers continued further downstream to establish how much of the watercourse had been impacted by the pollution. Tests carried out showed that ammonia levels were elevated in places as far as 2km downstream. On 15 March, Environment Agency officers returned to Southwell and met a representative from Severn Trent Water where they had contractors on site working to remediate the pollution and remove debris from the watercourse. The Potwell Dyke was grey/brown and still appeared cloudy at the sewer outfall. In places a pale scum was visible on the surface of the water. The following day an officer returned to the Potwell Dyke. Severn Trent Water’s contractors were still on site and had placed sandbags in the watercourse to prevent excess solids being carried downstream during the clean up from the culvert. The watercourse appeared much clearer downstream of the sandbags than upstream. Speaking after the case, an Environment Agency officer in charge of the investigation said: ”Although Severn Trent Water reported the discharge to us immediately, it was too late to prevent the pollution of the Potwell Dyke. We do everything we can to protect the environment, local rivers and watercourses. This case sends out a clear message that we will not hesitate to prosecute as necessary when environmental damage is caused.” In mitigation, the court took in to account Severn Trent Water’s early guilty plea and said that culpability was low because of their inspection regime and no previous incidents at this location. Severn Trent Water’s response to the incident was adequate; there was remedial action taken and a minimal impact on the ecosystem."

/government/news/reducing-flood-risk-in-girton,"Work is starting on Monday 15 September 2014 to reduce the flood risk in Girton, Cambridgeshire. Reducing flood risk in Girton  Environment Agency During heavy rainfall the service pipes which span the Oakington Road Bridge prevent the increased volume of water from flowing downstream and away from the village, raising the water levels in the Beck Brook and on occasion causing flooding from the brook. Georgina Nichols, Flood Risk Advisor at the Environment Agency said: The service pipes which carry everything from electricity and gas to cable TV and foul water will be relocated beneath the Beck Brook. We’ve worked closely with Cambridgeshire County Council throughout the process and have successfully negotiated the relocation of the pipes with each of the identified owners - without their full cooperation this project would not be possible. The Environment Agency has appointed contractor J N Bentley Ltd to carry out the preliminary works and the removal of the redundant pipes, once the services have been relocated beneath the brook. The work is expected to take approximately 6 weeks and will mean intermittent traffic restrictions. The brook will be temporarily dammed and water will be pumped over the works so that trenches, for the new pipes, can be dug in the dry. The trenches will then be back filled, the temporary dam will be removed and the owners of the service pipes will then be asked to reroute their services to the new pipes. The old service pipes will be taken down. The Environment Agency is responsible for managing the risk of flooding from main rivers, reservoirs, estuaries and the sea. Every £1 invested on protecting communities saves £8 in damage repair. The Environment Agency works in partnership with councils, businesses, communities and others to reduce the risk of flooding and create a better place for people and wildlife."

/government/news/northamptons-flood-warning-sirens-put-to-the-test,"A vital part of Northampton’s flood warning system will be tested this week.   Northampton’s flood warning sirens put to the test  Environment Agency The Environment Agency will be sounding its 5 flood sirens between 10am and 12pm on Thursday (13 Nov). Sirens, located in St James and Far Cotton, will be sounded separately and intermittently to make sure they will work properly during river flooding. Claire Rose, Flood Resilience Team Leader, said: “The sirens are used to warn people in Northampton about flooding from the River Nene. We test them every year to make sure they are working effectively. We apologise for any disturbance but hope people understand that we need to be sure the sirens will work in a flooding emergency. Anyone who hears the sirens between 10am and 12pm on the day of the test need not be alarmed or take action. If the sirens are heard at any other time, people should ring Floodline on 0345 988 1188 or 0845 988 1188 for the latest situation and tune into local radio. Environment Agency staff will be at the Asda supermarket in Far Cotton between 10am and 3pm on the day of the test to answer questions about the sirens and flooding in general. Information will be available on how to prepare for and respond to a flood and how to sign-up to the free flood warning service. An Environment Agency incident response vehicle will also be present. Claire said: We would encourage everyone living in Northampton to check whether they live somewhere that is at risk of flooding. If they do, they can register for our Floodline Warnings Direct service to receive free flood warnings that can be sent directly to them by phone, mobile, email or text. These messages will tell people what is happening, give them advice about what to do and keep them right up to date with the latest situation. Northampton residents can check the flood risk where they live by logging onto https://www.gov.uk/floodsdestroy or by calling the 24-hour Floodline Warnings Direct service on 0345 988 1188 or 0845 988 1188.

/government/news/bedfordshire-recycling-company-to-pay-23000-for-dirty-waste,"Sending waste abroad illegally landed a recycling company in court yesterday (Mon).   Bedfordshire recycling company to pay £23,000 for dirty waste  Environment Agency Monoworld Ltd admitted sending mixed waste to Germany and China without the prior written notification and consent of the authorities. Northampton magistrates fined the Sharnbrook, Bedfordshire company £10,000 and ordered it to pay full Environment Agency costs of £13,745. Headed for China and Germany The court heard that Monoworld Ltd arranged shipment of waste from its sister company’s site Monoworld Recycling at Rushden in Northamptonshire and in 2013 illegally tried to ship to the two countries. The Germany consignment was stopped by Dutch authorities and the China consignment was detected by Environment Agency officers in a routine inspection at the Port of Felixstowe. Directors of both companies are the same and the company was convicted in 2004 for 10 similar offences under earlier transfrontier shipment regulations and for keeping waste without a waste management licence. And in 2012 the company was issued a formal warning for a similar breach of the regulations when two containers of waste electrical and electronic equipment were destined for Hong Kong. Mrs Miriam Tordoff told magistrates that the ‘recycled’ plastic waste returned by Holland was contaminated with metal cans, food trays, aerosol cans and wood amongst other items and it smelt. There were also flies and some of the waste was a year old. Rodent droppings Agency investigators found there was no proper contract or financial guarantee between Monoworld Ltd and the German company where the waste was headed. Monoworld declined an interview with the Agency. The shipment bound for China was also found to contain plastics contaminated with decomposing plant leaves, latex gloves, wood, cans and cable as well as pockets of polluting brown liquid. Rodent droppings and mould could also be detected. In one container there were crushed wheelie bins that had not even been cleaned out, Mrs Tordoff told the court. She said waste should be baled separately for export. The company declined an interview with the Agency. Mrs Tordoff said: All the waste was dirty and odorous and contained non-plastic wastes which could easily have been sorted and cleaned before shipment. The court heard that enforcement notices under the TFS Regulations were served on both Monoworld Ltd and Monoworld Recycling in December 2013 and reissued in March 2014 after the offences came to light. They required the companies to introduce written management systems for the export of waste. Mrs Tordoff said they had since been complied with. Proceedures not followed Mrs Tordoff said: The procedures the company had in place before the offences did not specifically comply with TFS regulations but in any event were not followed. It was only in response to an enforcement notice served by the Environment Agency that an adequate management system was put in place. Mitigating for the company Ms Georgie Messent said Monoworld Ltd accepted there had been serious procedural failings but that the company had taken steps to address that with a £9.8 million investment in new sorting lines and a new recycling facility at the Rushden site. Sentencing the company, the Chair of the Magistrates said the offences were at best negligent and at worst deliberate. Considering all the facts the company’s actions were reckless. After the hearing Environment Agency officer Liz Williams said: We carry out inspections at ports to ensure waste rules are being followed and the law is clear there are rules to follow when exporting waste for recycling. Waste needs to be described accurately at all stages of the process so that everyone knows what they are dealing with. She said the export of waste without the proper authorization and controls undermined legitimate business. Charges Monoworld Ltd pleaded guilty to: 1) On or about 1 July 2013, and by virtue of Article 3(1)(b) of the European Waste Shipment Regulation EC 1013/2006, you transported mixed waste from Monoworld Recycling Facility, Saunders Lodge Industrial Estate, Rushden, Northamptonshire to Tönsmeier factory, Veolia Umweltservice West GbmH, Rottst. 12, 44653 Herne, Germany without the competent authority of dispatch having been notified in accordance with Article 4 of the said European Regulation.

/government/news/wokingham-shipping-company-and-director-fined-and-sentenced-for-illegal-export-of-waste,"A Wokingham shipping company has been fined and its director handed a prison sentence for attempting to illegally ship WEEE (Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment) to West Africa.   Wokingham shipping company and director fined and sentenced for illegal export of waste  Environment Agency Bakour Limited and company director, Adam Bakour, based at Rushton Farm, Warren House Road in Wokingham, pleaded guilty to offences relating to the attempted shipment of 6 containers filled with WEEE to various West African countries. On 23 March 2015, Reading Crown Court ordered Bakour Limited to pay a fine of £7,950. Adam Bakour, the sole company director, was sentenced to 18 months’ imprisonment, suspended for 2 years. Mr Bakour was also ordered to pay a contribution of £5,000 to the costs of the Environment Agency investigation and prosecution. Circumstances of the case The court heard that Bakour Ltd offers a professional shipping service for used electrical goods. The company obtained the items for shipment mainly from recycling centres, civic amenity sites and Sunday markets. The items included CRT (cathode ray tube) televisions and fridge freezers, which contain hazardous components. Hazardous WEEE should not be sent to countries which lack the capacity and infrastructure to ensure that the items are treated without risk to human health or the environment. Six shipping containers loaded with WEEE, some of which was hazardous, were stopped by the Environment Agency prior to export to various West African countries between October 2011 and August 2013. In each instance, the containers were filled with items from and loaded at Bakour Ltd’s premises at Rushton Farm in Wokingham. Each container was unloaded and examined at the Environment Agency’s dedicated inspection yard. The contents were examined for compliance with the Revised Correspondents’ Guidelines No1 on Shipments of Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment - the agreed European standard used by regulators and provided to industry to determine whether a shipment of electrical and electronic equipment is to be regarded as waste or not. Heather White, Environment Agency Officer said: Criminals may see illegal waste exports as an easy route to make money, but today’s verdict shows that waste crime doesn’t pay. Sending Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment with hazardous components to less economically developed countries is not only unlawful but immoral. It’s a crime that shows a blatant disregard for the safety and welfare of overseas communities and the environment. The court also heard that on 2 occasions Mr Bakour was interviewed under caution about the containers. The defendant stated that his company only exports working electrical goods and does not deliberately ship any waste items. As far as the stopped containers were concerned, Mr Bakour stated that his employees had not been carrying out their jobs properly. After the interview, an Enforcement Notice was served on Bakour Ltd, requiring certain steps to be taken to ensure compliance with legal guidelines. Heather White visited Bakour Ltd on 10 September 2013 and saw that procedures had improved. A further visit on 27 September 2013 demonstrated that the entire Notice had been complied with. Offences: Transporting waste specified in Article 36(1)(d) of European Regulation 1013/2006 on Shipments of Waste, namely a mixture of hazardous waste with non-hazardous waste, that was destined for recovery in a country to which the OECD decision does not apply – contrary to Regulation 23 of the Transfrontier Shipment of Waste Regulations 2007. Attempting to export items containing dicholorodiflouromethane (also known as R12 gas) which is prohibited from export out of the European Community by Article 17(1) of European Regulation 1005/2009 on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer – contrary to Regulation 4(1), Schedule 2 and Regulation 6 of the Environmental Protection (Control on Ozone-Depleting Substances) Regulations 2011."

/government/news/flood-siren-testing-planned-in-grimsby-and-cleethorpes,"The Environment Agency will carry out annual testing of its flood sirens in Grimsby and Cleethorpes next week.  Flood siren testing planned in Grimsby and Cleethorpes  Environment Agency The 18 sirens, installed in 2007, help warn more than 25,000 households and local businesses of imminent tidal flooding from the Humber. The siren on the Willows Estate, Grimsby, is used to warn residents about flooding from the River Freshney. The sirens are secondary to the Environment Agency’s Floodline Warnings Direct Service, which provides targeted flooding alerts via phone call or text to mobile or landlines, or through email. Testing of the sirens will take place on Friday, 28 August between 10am and 12pm. The test message will last around 2 minutes and will consist of a siren sound followed by a voice recording saying “Testing, testing. This is a test of the Grimsby and Cleethorpes Flood Warning System. No action required. No action required.” There will then be another short siren sound followed by a voice message saying “End of test. End of test. Thank you for your co-operation.” If you hear the sirens during this time, you do not need to take any action. If flooding was expected on the day, the Agency would reschedule the test for another occasion and issue warnings to those in the affected areas through the Floodline Warnings Direct system. If a severe flood warning is issued, the sirens would also be sounded. Claire Rose, Flood Resilience Team Leader with the Environment Agency, said: “The Floodline Warnings Direct service gives people as much notice as possible of potential flooding. Our flood sirens are another method of warning when flooding is imminent, so it’s important that we test them to make sure they will work during an emergency. “However, the best way to reduce your own risk is to sign up for our free, targeted flood alerts by calling 0345 988 1188.” Environment Agency staff will be in the Freshney Place shopping centre on Friday, 28 August from 9am to 5pm to answer questions about the sirens and flood risk, including what steps people can take to prepare for an emergency. Claire continued: “Our flood defences reduce the risk of flooding to thousands of homes and businesses in Grimsby and Cleethorpes, but no defence can ever completely remove all flood risk, so it’s important for people to know what to do before, during and after a flood to protect themselves and their property. “Anyone is very welcome to come and see us at Freshney Place to learn more about flood risk and how they can be prepared.” Steven Coe, Lead Flood Risk Management Officer at North East Lincolnshire Council (the lead local flood authority) said: “During the flood siren testing due to take place, North East Lincolnshire Council staff and its partner Cofely will be joining the Environment Agency in Freshney Place Shopping Centre between 9am and 5pm. We will be available to answer any questions on flood risk and how you can prepare.” There are more than 28,000 registrations with Floodline Warnings Direct in the Grimsby and Cleethorpes area, with about 4,100 properties fully registered. Warnings issued through Floodline are more targeted and specific, condaining advice on what actions to take and how to get more information.

/guidance/crc-energy-efficiency-scheme-allowances,"How to order, surrender and trade allowances. CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme: allowances Energy efficiency Environment Agency Ordering allowances For each compliance year, you need to order, pay for, and surrender allowances to cover your annual Carbon Reduction Commitment ( CRC ) CO 2 emissions. You can order allowances from government sales or buy from the open market using the CRC Registry . Each year there will be 2, fixed price government sales of allowances: a forecast sale at the beginning of the compliance year in April a buy to comply sale during the reporting period in June and July The price of allowances at the forecast sale will be lower to encourage you to forecast your emissions early and buy allowances in advance. During a government sale of allowances, you can submit as many orders as you like but only while the sale window is open. You can buy allowances on the open market at any time if a trader or other participant is offering them for sale. You use the CRC Registry to order allowances from a government sale or to identify allowances being traded on the open market. The CRC Registry guide ‘How to order allowances’ provides further help. Who orders To order allowances, you need to have a senior officer who exercises management control, plus at least 2 more people authorised to access your compliance account – known as ‘authorised contacts’. These can be your primary contact, secondary contact or nominated agent or account representative, if you have appointed one. Payment When you order government allowances, your authorised contacts and senior officer receive a confirmation email. Attached to this email will be a memorandum of account with payment details. You must pay the Department of Energy and Climate Change ( DECC ) using the bank account details provided in the memorandum of account. DECC need to receive your cleared funds before the deadline specified. Allowances won’t be allocated to your registry account until your payment has cleared. If you miss the payment deadline, you won’t receive your allowances before the deadline and you could risk a financial penalty. Your authorised contacts and senior officer receive a confirmation email once your allowances have been allocated to your compliance account. If you have underpaid or overpaid, the Environment Agency CRC team will contact you. For under payments, you can either: pay the outstanding balance before the end of the payment deadline, or revise your order in the registry For overpayments: you will only be allocated the number of allowances you have ordered DECC will refund your overpayment as soon as is possible but may deduct their bank charges You need to notify the CRC helpdesk - CRCHelp@environment-agency.gov.uk - immediately if you receive more allowances than you have paid for. If you have bought or sold allowances through a trade rather than a government sale, you arrange payment directly with the organisation you have bought from or sold to. Validity of allowances Forecast sale allowances are sold in April each year. They are valid for the compliance year in which they are sold and for future compliance years until the end of the CRC phase. You can’t surrender forecast allowances to cover CO 2 emissions from previous compliance years. Buy to comply allowances can be surrendered for the previous compliance year’s emissions and are also valid through to the end of the CRC phase. If you buy too many allowances in one year, you can keep these in your CRC compliance account and use them in future compliance years during the same CRC phase. Allowances are not transferrable from one phase of CRC to another. Trading allowances Trading allowances means buying from or selling to another account holder in the CRC Registry. The registry has a notice board facility that matches buyers and sellers. Your authorised contacts need a one time pass code ( OTP ) to transfer allowances to another participant as part of a trade. This is an additional security measure to check the identity of the person making the trade and prevent fraud. To be able to receive an OTP an authorised contact must first: undergo an ID check register their mobile phone number You request an ID check and register your mobile phone number via the CRC Registry . Each time an authorised contact is ready to transfer allowances they request an OTP through the CRC Registry. The OTP will be sent to their mobile phone. When they enter the OTP into the appropriate field in the registry the transfer is confirmed. All of your authorised contacts can order and surrender allowances, but only 3 authorised contacts at any one time can be approved for an OTP . The guide ‘How to trade allowances’ provides more help. Surrendering allowances Each compliance year you must surrender allowances equal to the quantity of CRC emissions calculated from your annual report. The deadline for surrendering allowances is the last working day in October. If you don’t surrender the correct number of allowances by the deadline, you may face financial penalties. If you didn’t buy enough allowances to cover your emissions, you should surrender as many allowances as you have by the deadline. This will help minimise your liability to penalties. You can request a special allocation of allowances if the Environment Agency has sent you an enforcement notice or civil penalty asking you to surrender allowances. The CRC helpdesk - CRCHelp@environment-agency.gov.uk - can help you arrange this. If you surrender too many allowances the surplus will count towards your surrender obligation for the next compliance year. Or, in some circumstances, you can request a refund from DECC . Your should use the DECC ‘ CRC repayment request form’ to request a refund. The DECC ‘Guidance on the CRC repayment mechanism for surplus allowances’ provides more information about refunds. Help and guidance Allowance prices for each compliance year are set by government. They’re published on the CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme page . Requirements for those registered in CRC Phase 2 are available in ‘ CRC : guidance for participants in Phase 2’ . The CRC Registry guide ‘How to surrender allowances’ provides information to help you surrender allowances.

/government/news/repeated-raw-sewage-leaks-lead-to-one-of-the-largest-water-company-fines,"On 23 September, Severn Trent Water appeared at Sheffield Crown Court for charges relating to a number of pollution incidents. Repeated raw sewage leaks, lead to one of the largest water company fines  Environment Agency Severn Trent Water Limited was fined £480,000, ordered to pay Environment Agency Costs of £13,675.38 as well as a victim surcharge of £120. Proceedings were brought by the Environment Agency following repeated pollution incidents where raw sewage leaked into a farmer’s field and a pond in a private fishery. That pond leads into the Kingsforth Brook at Bramley near Rotherham, which in turn leads downstream to the Maltby Dyke. The incidents occurred on 25 February 2014 and 26 March 2014. The company had been warned on 2 previous occasions for similar incidents at the same location. The Severn Trent pipeline that transported raw sewage to a treatment plant ruptured at the same point, which led to 4 pollution incidents within a year. The pollution directly contributed to fish deaths and samples taken by the Environment Agency suggested that it had also affected the local invertebrate community including freshwater shrimps. In passing sentence, the Judge stated that both offences were committed negligently and that the harm to the environment was localised, and therefore minor, albeit significant to those affected by the incident. The offences were aggravated by the fact that there had been previous warnings issued for 2 earlier incidents. Speaking after the case, an Environment Agency officer involved with the investigation said: “We were particularly concerned that, after 2 formal warnings from the Environment Agency about sewage leaking into fields and watercourses the third rupture was undetected by Severn Trent Water Ltd and there was then yet another incident in the same location.” “This is one of the largest fines ever to be imposed on a water company, and I hope it sends a strong message that it is far more cost effective to avoid these incidents, as we will continue to take companies and individuals to task where they ignore their responsibilities.” The FTSE 100 water and sewerage services company saw a 3.2pc rise in profits before exceptional items to £540.3m in its full-year financial results, published earlier this year."
/guidance/water-management-managing-your-water-abstraction-or-impoundment-licence,"Maintain, monitor and review your abstraction or impoundment licence.  Water management: managing your water abstraction or impoundment licence Water Environment Agency Abstraction charges The Environment Agency charges abstraction licence holders to fund the costs they incur in ensuring water resources are managed effectively while protecting the environment. This includes ensuring the rights of existing licence holders to abstract water are protected when granting new or varied licences. An annual subsistence charge, which comprises the Standard Unit Charge (SUC) and the Environmental Improvement Unit Charge (EIUC), is usually payable by everyone who holds a full licence to abstract water. Annual subsistence charges are not payable for temporary licences, transfer licences or for licences to impound water. Other limited exceptions to the annual subsistence charge can be found in the abstraction charges scheme April 2015 to March 2016 . To estimate your annual bill, use our abstraction charge calculator . Measuring and recording your abstraction Most licences require you to accurately measure and report the quantity of water you abstract. Metering requirements will form part of your discussions with the Environment Agency during the determination of your application. Measuring and recording the amount of water you abstract will allow you to take action to keep within the limits allowed in your licence. If you think you need to abstract more than your maximum quantity, you must contact the Environment Agency early. There is no guarantee that the Environment Agency will be able to increase the maximum quantity your licence allows you to abstract. Most abstractors must provide the Environment Agency with accurate records of how much water is taken in order to enable them to: ensure society’s need for water is balanced with that needed to maintain a healthy aquatic environment allocate spare resources to other abstractors charge some abstractors based on how much water they take check compliance with licence conditions provide information on water usage Reporting how much water you’ve abstracted Your abstraction licence will tell you how often you need to record the amount of water you abstract. Most licences will also ask you to submit a record of your actual abstraction (known as ‘returns’) to the Environment Agency. Even if you haven’t taken any water, you must submit a ‘nil’ return if your licence states that you must report your water use. If you do not submit your record of actual abstraction when required to do so, the Environment Agency may take enforcement action. If you spray irrigate and hold a two part tariff billing agreement your charges are partially calculated on the amount of water abstracted. To gain the full financial benefits of this agreement it is important that you submit your return, even if you haven’t abstracted any water. Submitting water abstraction returns You can submit your water abstraction returns using forms supplied by the Environment Agency or use their online reporting system called Generic Operator Returns (GOR). Submit water abstraction returns If you need to change your licence If your circumstances or need for water changes, you can apply to vary or revoke your abstraction or impoundment licence. To vary your abstraction or impoundment licence read the application guidance and complete both forms: application for a full or transfer licence – applicant details application for a full or transfer licence – technical details There is no charge to: make a minor change, such as updating your name and address – use application to make minor changes to a water abstraction licence reduce the quantity of water you abstract – use application to reduce a licensed water abstraction quantity revoke your abstraction licence – use application to revoke a water abstraction licence (ensure you provide the correct licence number when applying for a revocation) transfer the whole of an abstraction or impoundment licence from one person to another, read guidance and use – notice to transfer water abstraction or impoundment licence split (apportion) an existing licence between two or more persons, read guidance and use – application and agreement to share a water abstraction licence revoke your impoundment licence – complete and return the water abstraction or impoundment preliminary enquiry form (ensure you provide the correct licence number when applying for a revocation) Death/bankruptcy If the licence holder dies or is an individual who is declared bankrupt, the licence can become the responsibility of (can be ‘vested’ in) their trustee. The trustee must notify the Environment Agency within 15 months that they are responsible for the licence. If they do not notify the Environment Agency the licence will cease to have effect after 15 months. There is no guarantee a new licence could be issued, and if it could, it may be more restrictive. Enforced changes to your licence If your licensed abstraction is causing or could cause damage to the environment, the Environment Agency may make a proposal to change or revoke your licence. This will include adding a time limit to the licence if it does not already have one, unless you propose to make the licence change voluntarily. The licence holder may be entitled to compensation. However, if your licence needs to be changed or revoked because it is causing or could cause serious damage to the environment, you will not be entitled to compensation. To help you understand whether you are eligible for compensation, read the leaflet Restoring sustainable abstraction: compensation , or email the Environment Agency Restoring Sustainable Abstraction team: Email: rsa@environment-agency.gov.uk Checking compliance The Environment Agency carries out on-site inspections to check compliance with licence conditions, as well as checking abstraction returns. The main reason for inspections is to check compliance with the conditions in the abstraction or impoundment licence, but they are an opportunity to give advice and guidance on complying with a licence. They take a risk-based approach to inspections based on the sensitivity of a water source and the potential for damage. In particular, they visit where there is a high potential for damage to the environment or where there is a poor compliance history. Typically, reasons for inspecting include: where hands off flow condition limits or section 57 irrigation bans have been imposed – their drought plans contain more information about how they will step-up their compliance checks during a drought in response to incidents, such as reports of low flows if returns suggest over-abstraction or other non-compliance Enforcement Enforcement options include criminal sanctions (warnings, formal cautions and prosecution, with fines up to £20,000) and can also include civil sanctions. The options available for a specific offence are set out in our offence response options . If you are found to have breached your licence conditions or have committed an offence, the Environment Agency may take enforcement action. Actions will range from giving corrective advice and guidance to prosecution in the most serious cases. Helping you to comply with your licence is the priority. For example, if you get close to your annual authorised volume, they will discuss how you can adjust your usage to save water or apply to increase your licence quantities. Enforcement options can be used to achieve environmental outcomes, to stop offending, to correct damage, or bring abstraction under regulatory control. Any response is specific to the individual circumstances of each case and is based on the public interest factors set out in our enforcement and sanctions guidance . Where it is necessary to take enforcement action, this will usually be against the licence holder, so you must monitor the activity of anyone you allow to use an abstraction in your name."

/government/news/essar-fined-497284-for-environmental-offences-in-cheshire,"ESSAR Oil (UK) Limited, who operate Stanlow Oil Refinery in Ellesmere Port, pleaded guilty to 3 breaches of their environmental permit. ESSAR fined £497,284 for environmental offences in Cheshire  Environment Agency The company was sentenced on Tuesday 27 October 2015 at Chester Crown Court following a prosecution brought by the Environment Agency. They were fined £497,284 and ordered to pay costs of £40,000 in relation to 2 separate incidents which occurred in 2012. On 31 July 2012 the roof of an oil storage tank failed under pressure at Stanlow Oil Refinery. This caused a plume of steam and oil to be released into the atmosphere and fine droplets of oil were reported over an area approximately 5.3 kilomentre in length and 0.8 kilometre in width. At its furthest point, gravestones were affected at Overpool Cemetery, together with local businesses and vehicles which required cleaning. The incident resulted in a large number of complaints and the company incurred significant clean-up costs. In a separate incident on 19 August 2012 approximately 5 tonnes of oil entered the Manchester Ship Canal following failures in the operation of ESSAR’s effluent management system. As a result of the incident, the Manchester Ship Canal was closed for 2 days to all shipping traffic whilst an extensive clean-up operation was carried out. HHJ Shetty, the sentencing Judge, concluded that: “In my judgement this fine will achieve the statutory purpose. The penalty is not only proportionate and just, but will bring home to the management and shareholders the need to protect the environment.” Nigel Glasgow for the Environment Agency said: “These pollution incidents were significant events resulting in large numbers of complaints and clean up costs for ESSAR. Permit breaches of this nature are taken seriously by regulators and the courts. Since these incidents the Environment Agency has worked closely with ESSAR who have improved their environmental performance and we look forward to their continued co-operation. “The public can report environmental incidents to the Environment Agency on 0800 80 70 60.”"

/government/news/low-sign-up-to-flood-warnings-in-staffordshire,"The Environment Agency is urging residents at risk of flooding from the River Trent, River Tame, River Anker and the Smestow Brook in Staffordshire to sign up for free flood warnings. Low sign up to flood warnings in Staffordshire  Environment Agency Over 15,000 properties are at risk of being flooded but only about 7% of residents have signed up to receive the warnings. Some of these properties have a level of protection from flood defences, and others may not flood apart from in more extreme weather, but it costs nothing to sign up to receive flood warnings to be prepared. There are simple things people can do to better protect those close to them, their home and their business from flooding. Signing up to receive a warning could give people valuable time to move their family and pets to safety, as well as moving their possessions out of the way of flood water. Rob Lunt, Flood Resilience Adviser from the Environment Agency, said: It’s vital that residents are prepared for the next time a flood occurs and we urge everyone at risk of flooding to make sure they sign up to receive the warnings. Receiving alerts about when water levels are increasing can give people time to prepare and think about measures to put in place. You can check if you are at risk of flooding online or call Floodline on 0845 988 1188 to register to receive flood warnings. Contact Media enquiries: 0800 917 9267. Note to editors An automated flood warning gauge records the water level every 15 minutes.

/government/news/free-flood-warnings-for-ee-mobile-customers--2,"New project gets vital flood warnings to those at risk Free flood warnings for EE mobile customers  Environment Agency A ground-breaking scheme to send free Environment Agency flood warnings to EE mobile phone users will be completed this week with more than 400,000 people registered around the country. EE customers registered in specific flood risk areas across Yorkshire will receive a welcome telephone message from the Environment Agency’s Floodline Warnings Direct service over the coming weeks. The scheme is the first of its kind in England and follows successful roll-outs in March and July this year. Following those pilots, less than 1% of people added to the service decided to opt-out. Since 2010, the Floodline Warnings Direct service has enabled the Environment Agency to automatically register and send warnings to 600,000 homes and business landline numbers. Earlier this week, these warnings were issued to hundreds of properties across West and North Yorkshire, after heavy rain caused rivers in the Pennines to rise. However, this is first time that flood warnings will be issued directly through a mobile phone provider. This should make it easier for the Environment Agency to warn residents in communities where take up of the traditional warnings service is currently low, such as Hull, Doncaster and Goole. Jason Rees, EE’s Director of New Business, said: This new service clearly demonstrates the positive contribution that mobile technology makes to our everyday lives. The Floodline Warnings Direct service offers our customers a free and essential service. John Curtin, Executive Director of Flood Risk Management at the Environment Agency, said: We want to ensure that everyone has as much time as possible to prepare for flooding and by working with EE we’re now able to warn even more people about the risks. Flood warnings save lives and this ground-breaking initiative is another way to provide the public with vital time to protect their belongings and get themselves and their families out of harm’s way. Environment Minister Rory Stewart said: Flooding can devastate lives, homes and businesses. That’s why we are investing in flood protection at record levels, with an unprecedented six-year commitment of £2.3 billion to better protect an additional 300,000 homes by 2021. While nothing can take away the distress it can cause, it is important that everyone has access the right information, including the flood risk in their area, to give them peace of mind. This initiative from the Environment Agency is a great example of how we are making more data and technology available to help people plan and prepare for potential floods. The Environment Agency is now planning to work with other mobile providers to extend the warning service and reach more people directly. People can check their flood risk and register for free flood warnings by visiting our flood information pages or calling Floodline on 0345 988 1188."

You need to submit your annual report by the last working day of July, after the end of the compliance year. The first annual reports for phase 2 of CRC (the current phase) need to be submitted by 31 July 2015. Each autumn, the Environment Agency will publish a table showing the emissions data submitted by CRC participants in its Annual Report Publication (ARP). This replaces the Performance League Table (PLT). CRC : annual report information Here is a summary of the information you need to provide for your annual report. Energy supplies You need to report the total amount of CRC energy supplies across your whole organisation, including any subsidiaries and participant equivalent organisations (PE). You also need to report energy supplies for each individual PE. You must enter details of: supplies of electricity supplies of gas used for heating Some electricity and gas supplies are excluded from CRC . The document ‘ CRC guidance for participants in phase 2’ provides more information about excluded supplies. You need to indicate whether the supply data is actual or estimated. For actual supply data you must have at least two actual meter readings for that compliance year (April to March). These readings must be at least half a year apart. If you don’t have these, your supply data is defined as estimated and you must enter the figure into the ‘estimated supply’ column in the annual report. The CRC Registry will automatically add a 10% uplift to the emissions associated with an estimated supply to allow for any inaccuracies in the estimate. Electricity generated by renewables If applicable, enter the amount of electricity you have generated using renewables: for which you have received Renewable Obligation Certificates ( ROCs ) or Feed-in Tariffs ( FITs ), and that you have self-supplied and for which you have been issued with ROCs or FITs , and that you have self-supplied and generated on site from energy sources and technologies installed from 1 January 2008 and which are eligible for, but not claiming, ROCs or FITs Turnover data Providing this information is voluntary and you can leave this field blank.

Hazardous waste: rejected loads guidance Waste Environment Agency From 1 April 2016, premises no longer need to register as hazardous waste producers. This affects the entire hazardous waste control system. This guidance applies from 1 April 2016. Rejecting hazardous waste: overview This guidance explains the: procedure for rejecting hazardous waste the rules that apply to the consignee, carrier, producer and holder Consignee role and responsibilities Hazardous waste acceptance checks and when you must reject the waste You must check both the waste and the consignment note before you accept the waste. You must always reject hazardous waste that arrives at your site: without a consignment note with a consignment note that is incomplete or incorrect You may commit an offence if you don’t. See step 4 in the consignment guidance on when you must reject waste. You may also reject waste if your site operations are affected by site closure, maintenance, breakdown or bad weather. You must decide whether to accept or reject the waste before you sign part E of the consignment note. Once you have signed part E you can’t change your decision, ie if you sign as accepting you can’t later reject a waste - you became the holder of the waste at the point of signing. When you have an incomplete or incorrect consignment note You must: complete part E of the consignment note, enter the waste(s) you are rejecting and the reason keep one copy of the note give one copy to the carrier make copies of the note and send one to each of the consignor, producer and holder (they may be the same) immediately Hazardous waste arrives without a consignment note You may commit an offence if you (or another party) create a consignment note when the waste arrives at your site. This is a false and invalid note. You must provide in writing: the reason you rejected the waste the description or classification of the waste, if known the names of the producer, holder, consignor and carrier a consignment note code you assign in the format REJECT/XXXXX where ‘XXXXX’ is any 5 letters or numbers you use to give the load a unique code You must then: keep a copy of the explanation in your records give one copy to the carrier send a copy to each of the producer, holder and consignor (they may be the same) as soon as you can use this information for your returns to the Environment Agency and to the waste producer or holder What happens to the rejected waste? The carrier must tell the Environment Agency and contact the producer or holder for further instructions. The producer or holder has 3 options. It can: move the rejected waste to a new consignee move the rejected waste back to their own premises ask you to accept the waste you have rejected All of these require a new consignment note. If the producer or holder picks options 1 or 2 you need not be involved. It must arrange removal of the waste: immediately, if you’re not authorised or willing to store the waste temporarily within 5 working days in all other circumstances Accepting the rejected waste You can only accept a hazardous waste with a missing, incomplete or inaccurate consignment note if: you have first rejected it and explained your reasons for doing so the producer or holder asks you to accept the rejected waste your permit or exemption authorises you to do so You are not obliged to accept it. If you want to accept it the producer or holder must first: produce a new consignment note that is complete and correct address the reasons why the waste was rejected Complete consignee returns for rejected wastes You must report any waste you reject on your consignee return. You will not be charged for this. If you subsequently accept the rejected waste, this will be entered as a separate consignment on the consignee return. See the guidance on completing consignee returns for the detail. Carrier responsibilities You may commit an offence if you collect hazardous waste from a producer or holder with a missing, incomplete or incorrect consignment note leave the rejected waste at the consignee’s site The consignee must tell you why they rejected the waste, and enter the reason in part E of the consignment note. They must give you a copy. You must keep this as a record. You must immediately telephone the Environment Agency on 03708 506 506 (call charges) and give them the: consignment note code (or advise if there was no note) consignee’s name and address date and time of consignment rejection consignee’s reasons for rejecting the waste producer or consignor details your details You must then contact the producer or holder entered in part A2 of the consignment note for further instruction. Tell them the consignee rejected the waste and why. You must take all reasonable steps to carry out their wishes. The producer or holder has 3 options. It can: move the waste to another consignee move the waste back to the producer or holder - themselves ask the rejecting consignee to accept it These require a new consignment note. You must not return the waste to the producer or holder if you have mixed the waste collected from 2 or more producers, eg in a tanker. Producer or holder responsibilities If a consignee rejects your waste, the carrier must contact you at once and explain why. It is your responsibility to decide what happens next to the rejected waste. You have 3 options, you can: move the waste to another consignee move the waste back to your premises ask the rejecting consignee to accept it These require a new consignment note. Once you decide you must do both of the following: tell the carrier what to do with the waste telephone the Environment Agency on 03708 506 506 (call charges) to tell them what you have decided to do The waste must then be moved: immediately, if the rejecting consignee is not authorised to store the waste or declines to do so within 5 working days, in all other circumstances Moving the hazardous waste to another consignee You can arrange for the rejected waste to move to a new consignee who has a permit or exemption that allows them to accept the waste. You must tell the new consignee why the first consignee rejected the waste. Moving the hazardous waste back to your premises You can arrange for the waste to be returned to the premises it was collected from - the place entered in part A2 of the rejected consignment note. When you receive hazardous waste you become a consignee and must: hold a permit or exemption that allows you to store this waste at your premises provide a consignee return to the Environment Agency, reporting receipt of the waste This choice is not possible if your carrier mixed your waste with other waste during collection, eg in a tanker. Ask the consignee to accept your hazardous waste The consignee who rejected the waste must give their reasons for doing so. If you want them to accept the rejected waste you must contact them and fully address these reasons. They are not obliged to accept the rejected waste, but may do so if their permit or exemption allows them to. New consignment notes for rejected hazardous waste Each of the 3 producer options requires a new consignment note. You can ask the carrier to complete a new note for you, eg if the consignee’s site isn’t near your premises. The carrier can complete parts A, B and D including signing as the consignor. But you are responsible for all the information entered being correct. Copies of the new consignment note must be provided to the: original consignor, producer or holder - you carrier new consignee When completing the new note, the consignment note code must have an ‘R’ added at the end of: the original consignment note code for the rejected consignment - in the format XXXXXX/YYYYYR the code assigned by the rejecting consignee if there was no note - in the format REJECT/YYYYYR The information entered in part A2 should be the detail of the original producer or holder’s premises from which the rejected consignment originated - not the details of the site that rejected the waste."

/guidance/flood-risk-assessments-climate-change-allowances,"Find out when and how to use climate change allowances in flood risk assessments and strategic flood risk assessments. Flood risk assessments: climate change allowances  Environment Agency The National Planning Policy Framework ( NPPF ) sets out how the planning system should help minimise vulnerability and provide resilience to the impacts of climate change. NPPF and supporting planning practice guidance on Flood Risk and Coastal Change explain when and how flood risk assessments should be used. This includes demonstrating how flood risk will be managed now and over the development’s lifetime, taking climate change into account. Local planning authorities refer to this when preparing local plans and considering planning applications. This advice updates previous climate change allowances to support NPPF . The Environment Agency ( EA ) has produced it as the government’s expert on flood risk. What climate change allowances are Making an allowance for climate change in your flood risk assessment will help to minimise vulnerability and provide resilience to flooding and coastal change in the future. The climate change allowances are predictions of anticipated change for: peak river flow by river basin district peak rainfall intensity sea level rise offshore wind speed and extreme wave height They are based on climate change projections and different scenarios of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions to the atmosphere. There are different allowances for different epochs or periods of time over the next century. When to use the climate change allowances You need to bear in mind EA will use these allowances as benchmarks when providing advice on flood risk assessments and strategic flood risk assessments. Contact EA if you are unsure. Temporary exceptions for transitional arrangements that apply as of 19 February 2016 You may have prepared assessments using the previous allowances (published in 2013). EA will base its advice on the previous allowances where development plans or proposals are well advanced. This will include: a development plan already submitted for examination a valid planning application already submitted to the local planning authority If your development is particularly sensitive to flood risk or in a vulnerable location, EA will base its advice on the allowances in this advice. Contact EA if you are unsure. Other exceptions – when it might be appropriate to use other data or climate change allowances There may be circumstances where local evidence supports the use of other data or allowances. For example, the impact of climate change on peak river flow may not be even across all river catchments in a river basin district. In EA ’s role as a technical advisor they may want to check how and why you used other data in your plans and proposals. Types of allowances Peak river flow allowances by river basin district The peak river flow allowances show the anticipated changes to peak flow by river basin district. Use the river basin maps to help decide which river basin you are in. The range of allowances in table 1 is based on percentiles. A percentile is a measure used in statistics to describe the proportion of possible scenarios that fall below an allowance level. The 50th percentile is the point at which half of the possible scenarios for peak flows fall below it and half fall above it. The: central allowance is based on the 50th percentile higher central is based on the 70th percentile upper end is based on the 90th percentile So, if the central allowance is 30%, scientific evidence suggests that it is just as likely that the increase in peak river flow will be more than 30% as less than 30%. At the higher central allowance 70% of the possible scenarios fall below this value. So, if the higher allowance is 40%, then current scientific evidence suggests that there is a 70% chance that peak flows will increase by less than this value, but there remains a 30% chance that peak flows will increase by more. Decide which peak river flow allowances to use for different types of assessment EA uses the following data and standards as the benchmarks for the advice it gives as a statutory consultee : peak river flow allowances by river basin district in table 1 for both flood risk assessments and strategic flood risk assessments flood risk vulnerability classification for the type of development and flood zone , over the lifetime of the proposed development, in development plan allocations for strategic flood risk assessments flood risk vulnerability classification for the type of development and flood zone as a guide to decide which allowances to use based on the vulnerability of the development for flood risk assessments - you should consider the lifetime of the proposed development to decide which future time period to use EA will want to see if you have considered if it is appropriate to apply high++ allowances for your flood risk assessment or strategic flood risk assessment.

This will help you understand the range of impact. The higher central, central, and upper end allowances are in table 1 . In flood zone 2 essential infrastructure – use the higher central and upper end to assess a range of allowances highly vulnerable – use the higher central and upper end to assess a range of allowances more vulnerable – use the central and higher central to assess a range of allowances less vulnerable – use the central allowance water compatible – use none of the allowances In flood zone 3a essential infrastructure – use the upper end allowance highly vulnerable – development should not be permitted more vulnerable – use the higher central and upper end to assess a range of allowances less vulnerable – use the central and higher central to assess a range of allowances water compatible – use the central allowance In flood zone 3b essential infrastructure – use the upper end allowance highly vulnerable – development should not be permitted more vulnerable – development should not be permitted less vulnerable – development should not be permitted water compatible – use the central allowance If (exceptionally) development is considered appropriate when not in accordance with flood zone vulnerability categories, then it would be appropriate to use the upper end allowance. Peak rainfall intensity allowance Increased rainfall affects river levels and land and urban drainage systems. When to use the peak rainfall intensity allowance Table 2 shows anticipated changes in extreme rainfall intensity in small and urban catchments. For flood risk assessments and strategic flood risk assessments, assess both the central and upper end allowances to understand the range of impact. Table 2 peak rainfall intensity allowance in small and urban catchments (use 1961 to 1990 baseline) Applies across all of England Total potential change anticipated for the ‘2020s’ (2015 to 2039) Total potential change anticipated for the ‘2050s’ (2040 to 2069) Total potential change anticipated for the ‘2080s’ (2070 to 2115) Upper end 10% 20% 40% Central 5% 10% 20% Sea level allowances There is a single regional allowance for each epoch or time frame for sea level rise in table 3 . EA expect sea level rise to increase the rate of coastal erosion. Use the coastal erosion risk maps to plan for any changes in the position of the coastline. The maps are based on the best available data. They show the shoreline management plan policy for each stretch of coast and erosion predictions where there is no policy to maintain defences. EA will want to see if you have considered if it is appropriate to apply high++ allowances for your flood risk assessment or strategic flood risk assessment. Table 3 sea level allowance for each epoch in millimetres ( mm ) per year with cumulative sea level rise for each epoch in brackets (use 1990 baseline) Area of England 1990 to 2025 2026 to 2055 2056 to 2085 2086 to 2115 Cumulative rise 1990 to 2115 / metres ( m ) East, east midlands, London, south east 4 (140 mm ) 8.5 (255 mm ) 12 (360 mm ) 15 (450 mm ) 1.21 m South West 3.5 (122.5 mm ) 8 (240 mm ) 11.5 (345 mm ) 14.5 (435 mm ) 1.14 m North west, north east 2.5 (87.5 mm ) 7 (210 mm ) 10 (300 mm ) 13 (390 mm ) 0.99 m These allowances account for slow land movement. This is due to ‘glacial isostatic adjustment’ resulting from the release of pressure after ice that covered large parts of northern Britain melted at the end of the last ice age. The northern part of the country is slowly rising and the southern part is slowly sinking. This is why net sea level rise is less for the north west and north east than the rest of the country. To calculate sea level, add the allowances for the appropriate one of the 3 geographical areas to the 1990 base sea level year. For example, to derive sea levels: up to 2025, use the 4 mm per year, 3.5 mm per year or 2.5 mm per year rates or the 140 mm , 122.5 or 87.5 mm cumulative totals for the appropriate geographical area from 2026 to 2055, the increase in sea level in this period is derived by adding the number of years on from 2025 (to 2056), multiplied by the respective rate shown in the table for the appropriate geographical area, or if the whole time period applies use the cumulative total treat subsequent time periods 2056 to 2085 and 2086 to 2115 as you would 2026 to 2055 Offshore wind speed and extreme wave height allowance Wave heights may change because of increased water depths resulting from climate change. The frequency, duration and severity of storms could also change. EA will want to see if you have used the single allowance for each epoch for wind speed and wave height in table 4 and the 10% sensitivity allowance to understand the range of impact. Table 4 offshore wind speed and extreme wave height allowance (use 1990 baseline) Applies around all the English coast 1990 to 2055 2056 to 2115 Offshore wind speed allowance +5% +10% Offshore wind speed sensitivity test +10% +10% Extreme wave height allowance +5% +10% Extreme wave height sensitivity test +10% +10% High++ allowances for peak river flood flow and mean sea level The high++ allowances will only apply in assessments for developments that are very sensitive to flood risk and with lifetimes beyond the end of the century. For example, infrastructure projects or developments that significantly change existing settlement patterns. This includes urban extensions and new settlements. The high++ allowances are in EA guidance ‘Adapting to climate change - advice for flood and coastal erosion risk management authorities’ . How to use a range of allowances for peak river flow and peak rainfall intensity To help you decide which allowances to use to inform the flood levels that the flood risk management strategy will be based on for a development or development plan allocation, consider the: likely depth, speed and extent of flooding for each allowance of climate change over time considering the allowances for the relevant epoch (2020s, 2050s and 2080s) vulnerability of the proposed development types or land use allocations to flooding ‘built in’ resilience measures used, for example, raised floor levels capacity or space in the development to include additional resilience measures in the future, using a ‘managed adaptive’ approach Future flood risk management There may be instances where some flood risk management measures are not necessary now but may be in the future. This is a ‘managed adaptive approach’, for example, setting a development away from a river so it is easier to improve flood defences in the future. EA will consider whether a managed adaptive approach might be appropriate when reviewing your plans or proposals.

/guidance/importing-and-exporting-waste,"There are European and UK rules governing how you can ship waste into or out of the country. Waste: import and export Waste Environment Agency The regulations apply from the point of loading the waste until it has been fully recovered or disposed of at the destination facility. If you fail to follow them, you may be committing a criminal offence and risk prosecution, financial penalties and/or imprisonment. The controls that apply to your waste shipment will depend on the: treatment planned for the waste when it reaches its destination country of destination and the transport route waste type Knowing this information will allow you to decide if your waste shipment: is prohibited requires prior notification and consent from the competent authorities concerned (also known as notification controls) can occur under Article 18 controls (also known as green list controls) – this is a lower form of control than notification, and mainly applies to shipment of non-hazardous waste International Waste Shipments ( IWS ) or transfrontier shipments of waste are other terms for exporting and importing waste – they mean the same thing. If you produce, carry, import, keep or dispose of waste you have responsibilities. You have a legal duty of care to make sure your waste is handled safely and only passed to people who are authorised to receive it. Everyone involved in the shipment must ensure that any waste is managed without endangering human health and in an environmentally sound manner. Waste shipment controls Follow these steps to work out the controls that apply to your waste shipment and what forms you need to complete. 1: Is it waste? You must first find out if the material to be exported or imported is classed as waste by any country involved in the journey. If so, then waste shipment controls apply to the whole journey. To help you decide if your material is waste, see: Defra guidance on legal definitions of waste European Commission Waste Framework Directive end-of waste criteria Quality protocols: agreed end of waste criteria You must then work out if the intended journey and destination for your waste is legal. All exports or imports of waste to or from European Union ( EU ) countries are governed by the EU Waste Shipments Regulation . Wherever else you ship waste, you must comply with the requirements of this regulation and import controls of any countries outside the EU . This includes any countries through which the waste will pass or dock during transport. See list of: EU countries OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries competent authorities of EU member states competent authorities of OECD countries competent authorities of non- OECD countries Where the competent authorities disagree on whether something is waste, it will be classed as waste. 2: Disposal or recovery The terms ‘disposal’ and ‘recovery’ are defined in the EU Waste Framework Directive . Importing and exporting waste for recovery is possible, depending on country controls, waste type and destination. Exports or imports of waste for disposal are prohibited, save for a few exceptions described in the UK plan for waste shipments . In these exceptions notification controls will always apply. 3: Classify your waste You must match your waste to one of the description codes listed in the annexes to the Waste Shipments Regulation . You may find it easier to use the consolidated waste list – it has all the annexes in one document. You must include the correct code in any forms you complete for shipping your waste. If there is no code for your waste, you must describe it as ‘not listed’. 4: Export or import controls The controls are in Article 18 , notification or prohibition. The general rules are outlined below but you must confirm control with the destination country. Recovery in other EU member states Article 18 controls generally apply to waste listed under a single entry in annex III, IIIB or the mixtures of wastes listed in annex IIIA. Notification controls apply to all other wastes. Recovery in OECD countries outside the EU Article 18 controls generally apply to waste listed under a single entry in annex III or the mixtures of wastes listed in annex IIIA. Notification controls apply to all other wastes. Recovery in a non- OECD country outside the EU Certain wastes listed in annex V are prohibited from export including hazardous waste and household waste. Check the EU (green list) regulations which set out the controls that apply to waste listed in annex III and IIIA according to each non- OECD country. If you export wastes such as packaging, batteries, end of life vehicles or waste electrical and electronic equipment, there is additional producer responsibility legislation which you may need to comply with. You should now know if your waste shipment is subject to Article 18 , notification controls or prohibition. Use the waste export tool Alternatively use the waste export controls tool to work out the correct code and control for your shipment. Be aware that it is a guide only. Before shipping always check the controls with the transit and destination countries or their government departments, customs inspectorates or official waste regulatory bodies. Apply for import or export notification controls You must: apply to the competent authority of the country from where the waste will be exported by completing a notification and paying the correct fees obtain consent from the relevant exporting and importing countries, paying any additional fees required by the importing competent authorities: Competent authorities of EU countries Competent authorities of OECD countries Competent authorities of non- OECD countries To export from England, you must: be under the jurisdiction of England or Wales apply to and obtain consent from the Environment Agency and importing competent authorities and be one of: the original waste producer the licensed new producer a licensed collector of waste a registered dealer or broker with written authorisation from a producer or licensed collector to move their waste the holder of the waste when all the above are unknown or insolvent For exports from England: use IWS online 1. Complete a notification application online IWS online will enable you to: complete your notification application see an up to date status of your notification create a new notification based on a previous one create pre-notifications record shipment data upload your movement documents see a summary of your shipment data When you use the system for the first time you will need to register for a user account. You can phone the Environment Agency on 03708 506 506 (call charges apply) if you need help. You can’t use this system for recording annex VII forms. 2. Interim operations Pre-processing or storing waste at a site overseas before moving it to a place of final recovery is called an ‘interim operation’. The Waste Shipment Regulation specifies 5 interim operations using these codes: R12 - exchange of wastes R13 - accumulation of wastes D13 - blending or mixing of wastes D14 - repackaging of wastes D15 - storage of wastes R = recovery, D = disposal If your waste is destined for an interim operation you must provide details of the waste treatment operation, and where it will take place, on the notification document. You will also need to complete an interim movement form before your waste moves. 3. Financial guarantee or insurance This makes sure there’s enough money available for the Environment Agency to deal with the waste if the shipment isn’t completed, including the cost of returning the exported waste. The approved guarantee or insurance must be sufficient to cover: transporting the waste waste recovery or disposal storage for up to 90 days Any competent authority may ask for a copy of your financial guarantee or insurance arrangements. For exports from England and all non- EU imports, your financial guarantee or equivalent insurance must be approved by the Environment Agency. Use the financial guarantee form to apply. Your financial guarantee must be approved before shipments can commence. 4. Contract Before you submit your notification application you must have a legally enforceable, written contract with the business that will be recovering or disposing of your notified waste. This contract must include: a certificate from the business recovering or disposing of the waste, confirming they have legally recovered or disposed of the waste an obligation for the notifier to take the waste back if the shipment, recovery or disposal does not go ahead as intended, or if the shipment is illegal an obligation for the importer (consignee) to recover or dispose of the waste if it is found to be illegal as a result of the consignee’s action There are additional contractual obligations for exports to certain countries and also where an interim operation is to occur. The Environment Agency, or any other competent authority with an interest in the notification, may ask for a copy of the contract. 5.Third party insurance You need this in place before you send in your notification application. Any competent authority concerned may ask for a copy of the insurance arrangements. 6. Pay the charge You need to pay a charge when notification is made. The Environment Agency will not process your notification without evidence that you have paid the correct amount. Other competent authorities may also impose a charge for considering your notification. The charge depends on: whether the waste is being imported or exported the purpose of the shipment, whether it is for recovery or disposal the band the number of shipments included in the notification falls into Charges for notifications of International Waste Shipments Activity             Number of shipments: 1 2 to 5 6 to 20 21 to 100 101 to 500 500+ Export for recovery £1,450 £1,450 £2,700 £4,070 £7,920 £14,380 Export for non interim disposal £1,540 £1,540 £3,330 £5,500 £10,600 £19,500 Export for interim disposal £1,700 £1,700 £3,330 £,6,000 £12,900 £24,000 Import for non interim recovery £1,250 £1,250 £2,700 £4,900 £10,600 £19,500 Import for interim recovery £1,450 £1,450 £2,830 £5,500 £12,900 £24,000 Import for non interim disposal £1,540 £1,540 £3,330 £5,500 £10,600 £19,500 Import for interim disposal £1,700 £1,700 £3,330 £,6,000 £12,900 £24,000 Charges are payable to the Environment Agency . 7. Send the application The originally signed notification package must be sent to the Environment Agency with the correct fee. Send your notification package to: International Waste Shipments Team Environment Agency Richard Fairclough House Knutsford Road Warrington WA4 1HT 8. Application assessment These timings and stages are for waste moving within the EU . For waste moving outside the EU , the Environment Agency will advise you if any of the stages will take longer. If your notification package is complete, the Environment Agency will send it to all competent authorities involved within 3 working days of receiving it. They will ask you for further information if your notification package is incomplete. If you do not hear from the Environment Agency within 30 days of submitting a complete notification, email askshipments@environment-agency.gov.uk . 9. Competent authority of destination reviews the notification package The competent authority must check they have all the information they need within 3 days of receiving the notification package. They may ask for more details, or ask to see copies of documents such as contracts. Other competent authorities involved in your waste’s journey will also receive a copy of your notification package and may ask for more information. Once the competent authority of destination is satisfied that the notification package is complete, they have 3 working days to complete block 19 of the notification document. They will send a copy of this to you and all the competent authorities involved. Please note that the time taken for a transmitted notification package to arrive by post will vary, depending on the country of destination. 10. Notification decision Within 30 days of the notification decision, the competent authorities must decide if they: consent to the notification without conditions consent to the notification with conditions object Any of the competent authorities involved may object, but only using reasons set out in the Waste Shipment Regulation . The competent authorities will send you copies of their decisions. If competent authorities of transit countries make no response within 30 days, it’s assumed that they agree to the waste shipment. Notification controls: how to comply Exporting waste from England Your consent allows you up to 12 months from the date of consent to ship your waste. You can only ship the type and quantity of waste described in the notification, using the destination and route described in your notification. If the destination site has pre-consent status, your consent may allow you up to 3 years to ship your waste. Before the waste moves Check you have all the consents you need from the competent authorities involved and your financial guarantee is approved and valid. Create a pre-notification on IWS online - print and sign it then upload it to IWS online. Send copies to the other competent authorities and the destination waste facility, but not more than 30 days before you intend to ship and no later than 3 working days before shipping. Check the carriers you intend to use are registered and permitted to carry your waste shipment in each country. You do not need to send the Environment Agency a copy of your pre-notification if you have uploaded it to IWS online, but you will need to ensure the pre-notification document is completed before the start of the shipment (blocks 2, 5 to 8). You must complete a movement document and keep a copy for every shipment made under the consented notification. A shipment (which may consist of more than one vehicle or container) starts at the place of loading and continues until the waste is fully recovered at the destination facility. When the waste moves A copy of the completed movement document and the consented notification document, including annexes, must go with the waste and stay with it throughout the journey. Shipment data must be added to IWS online upon receipt and then upon the recovery or disposal of the waste. Rejected waste If the waste has left England but is then rejected by another competent authority, it may need to be brought back or transported to a different site for recovery or disposal. You must comply with the requirements of the competent authority concerned. It may be necessary to use your financial guarantee to ensure the waste is recovered in an environmentally sound manner. If the notified waste shipment doesn’t go ahead If the shipment cannot proceed within 10 working days of the actual date of shipment specified in block 6 of the movement document, the Environment Agency will consider that shipment ‘cancelled’. Other competent authorities may have different rules on when a shipment is cancelled. You must tell all the competent authorities involved. Once cancelled you cannot change the shipment date or reuse the shipment number. Increase the number of waste shipments Before you can request an increase in the shipments permitted on a notification, you must: send the written request to the Environment Agency before any extra shipments take place get written consent for your extra shipments from all the competent authorities involved not exceed the maximum tonnage detailed in block 5 of your notification document You may need to pay extra – check the charges table . Get a refund on a notification charge You may get a refund from the Environment Agency if: your notification is objected to you withdraw your notification before it is consented to none of the waste under your notification is shipped You must apply for a refund within 12 months of the notification’s date of consent. If consent has not yet expired it will be withdrawn. Apply for a new notification You may do this before your existing consent expires. Importing waste Before you arrange to import any waste you should contact the competent authority of the country of export to find out what their procedures and requirements are. Receive notified waste: actions For each shipment of waste that arrives, the recovery/disposal facility must complete block 18 of the movement form . They must state: if the shipment is for disposal or recovery the date of receipt whether they accept or reject the shipment the quantity of waste in the shipment the approximate date of recovery or disposal the name and signature of someone at the destination facility with authority to confirm receipt of the waste You must: keep a copy of the completed movement document for at least 3 years from the date the shipment starts send copies to the notifier and all competent authorities involved within 3 working days of receipt of the waste pay the appropriate charge (the Environment Agency will contact you about this) Reject the waste If a shipment of waste arrives at your site in England without the notification and movement documents, or it cannot be completed in accordance with the documents, you must: immediately quarantine the waste contact the Environment Agency Recover or dispose of the waste: actions to take You must treat the waste as specified in the notification document. You have one year from the date of receiving the waste to do this unless your environmental permit requires it to be done sooner. Within 30 days of completing the treatment, the recovery/disposal facility must fill in block 19 of the movement form with the: date of the waste’s recovery or disposal name and signature of a person with authority to confirm the recovery or disposal company stamp You must: keep a copy of the completed movement document for at least 3 years from the date the shipment starts send copies to the notifier and all competent authorities involved You will need to follow different actions where an interim operation occurs. The notification expires The notification expires when: the competent authority receives signed copies of the movement documents for all shipments of waste made under the notification, confirming that all the waste has been recovered or disposed of or, if earlier, the consent given by the competent authority reaches its expiry date When all the waste has been correctly recovered or disposed of, you can ask the competent authority to release the financial guarantee. You must keep all documents about the waste shipment and treatment for at least 3 years from the date the shipment starts. Apply for site pre-consent If you operate a waste recovery site with a permit and regularly receive shipments of the same waste, you may benefit from having a pre-consent. The advantages are that: there’s no cost to apply the notification process is quicker consents may last up to 3 years, rather than the standard 12 months Recovery facilities in England can apply using the pre-consent form . Overseas recovery facilities must apply to the competent authority of the country in which they are located. Import or export: Article 18 controls Check your ‘green list’ waste for contamination. A waste which you may think is ‘green list’ may need prior notification and consent, or may be prohibited if it is: not properly sorted mixed with a hazardous substance, eg if a batch of waste plastic contains residues of pesticide mixed with another waste material which is more than a de minimis level of contamination and to an extent which prevents the recovery of the wastes in an ‘environmentally sound manner’, eg if glass, metals, plastic or wood are in a consignment of waste paper contaminated by household or mixed municipal waste Ship ‘green list’ waste under Article 18 controls You can export ‘green list’ waste without permission from, or payment of fees to, the competent authorities of the countries involved in the shipment, unless more stringent controls are required by the importing country. It is your responsibility to check all the requirements that apply. Before shipping the waste: checklist Confirm the waste will be handled in an environmentally sound way at all times – you must be able to show that the recovery facility operates to human health and environmental protection standards that are broadly equivalent to the standards within the EU . Make sure that the annex VII document is fully completed and sign it – it must travel with the waste at all times. Draw up a written contract between the person who arranges the shipment (exporter) and the importer/consignee – the contract must ensure that if the shipment cannot be completed as planned, or is found to be illegal, the exporter will take the waste back or recover it in another way, and provide for its storage in the meantime. Complete the annex VII document: checklist Contact details must be in full - include the contact name, company registered number if applicable, address, email and telephone number. Business confidentiality is not a reason for omitting these details. The exporter in block 1 is the person who arranges the shipment and signs the declaration in block 12 to say that you have a contract in place. If you are a broker/dealer based in the European Union ( EU ), you must be registered with the Environment Agency, the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA) or Natural Resources Wales if you arrange waste shipments from Great Britain. If you are a broker or dealer based outside the EU , you must be registered and also have a personal or business address in the UK. The importer or consignee in block 2 may be the recovery facility or a broker/dealer who is under the jurisdiction of the country of destination and has legal control over the waste when it arrives there. The recovery facility in block 7 must be the facility where the waste will be recovered. If the recovery operation is R12 or R13, you must also provide information about the facilities where further operations will take place. The appropriate codes for block 8 can be found in annex II of the EU Waste Framework Directive. If the recovery operation is R12 or R13, you must also provide information on further operations. After the waste arrives: checklist The importer or consignee and (if different) the recovery facility must sign and complete the annex VII form at blocks 13 and 14. Exporters, importers and consignees must keep copies of the forms for 3 years – competent authorities can ask to see them."

/guidance/crc-energy-efficiency-scheme-evidence-audits-and-penalties,"How to create a CRC evidence pack, how regulators audit to check compliance and penalties for non-compliance. CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme: evidence, audits and penalties Energy efficiency Environment Agency CRC evidence packs You must keep records to validate any information you have submitted about your organisation, energy supplies and use. You should keep this in an evidence pack that the regulators can examine during an audit. You also need to carry out your own internal audit of your records at least once a year. Your evidence pack must include an audit certificate signed by a senior officer. There is no prescribed format for an evidence pack but you can use the tools the Environment Agency has provided to develop yours. These include workbook calculators, tables, checklists and templates. Appendix K of ‘ CRC guidance for participants in phase 2’ will help you develop your evidence pack. CRC : enforcement and penalties for non-compliance Our approach to CRC enforcement is explained in Annex 4 of our Enforcement and Sanctions Guidance . The Environment Agency can issue civil penalties to organisations that don’t comply with the CRC obligations by the deadlines set. It can also publish the name of the organisation receiving the civil penalty, details of the failure and the penalty amount. You could incur civil penalties if you don’t: register disclose information on registration submit an annual report on time provide accurate information or notifications (in relation to registration or designated change) provide an accurate annual report surrender allowances maintain an evidence pack CRC non-compliance: details of civil penalties issued Details of penalties are usually published for one year, or longer if justified by the seriousness of the failure. CRC audits Your regulator may carry out an audit to check you are keeping sufficient records in your evidence pack and reporting your emissions accurately. The regulator will either carry out the audit itself or use trained and approved contractors. Organisations are selected for audit based on: risk of non-compliance complexity of organisational structure compliance history If you are selected for audit, your primary and secondary contact will receive an email requesting to arrange a mutually convenient time to hold a teleconference or meeting with you. You may be asked to provide information prior to this, including: a summary of your evidence pack details of your energy usage a copy of your most recent audit report CRC : help and guidance ‘ CRC guidance for participants in phase 2’ provides more information about creating an evidence pack and audits. The ‘Compliance audit need to know guide’ and ‘Preparing for the compliance audit’ will help you prepare if you are selected for an audit.

/guidance/hazardous-waste-returns-supplementary-guidance,"How to send returns to the Environment Agency and producer if you receive or dispose of hazardous waste. Hazardous waste: consignee returns guidance (England) Waste Environment Agency From 1 April 2016, premises no longer need to register as hazardous waste producers. This change affects the entire hazardous waste control system. This guidance applies from 1 April 2016. Returns on hazardous waste: overview If you receive (or reject) any hazardous waste you must send a report to the Environment Agency. These are known as ‘returns’. This includes for example, a: service business depot receiving waste produced by its staff at customer premises, eg service engineers maintaining refrigeration units, photocopiers, lifts, forklifts etc business moving its own waste from one of its premises to another of its premises business accepting waste returned by/from its customers, eg shops or suppliers accepting waste electrical devices or paint from business customers registered exempt or permitted waste facility accepting hazardous waste from others exempt or permitted site that rejects a hazardous waste, eg because the site was not permitted to accept it If you dispose of hazardous waste at the premises where it is produced you may also need to send returns. If you do any of these things you are a ‘consignee’. Consignee returns: using the spreadsheet tool Completing the spreadsheet To use the spreadsheet you need to have a Windows operating system, and to enable macros in Microsoft Office/Excel. You must complete the spreadsheet in this order: click on ‘consignee details’ - you can click the ‘i’ button for guidance enter contact details, and press ‘>’ enter site details, and press ‘>’ enter billing details and return period, and press ‘save’ press ‘exit’ to return to the main menu - this is available on each screen click on consignment details click ‘add new consignment’ to add details of a consignment note: the producer postcode must be the postcode from part A2, the place where the waste was collected from if there is more than one type of waste in the consignment, add them by using ‘add new waste’, also use this if a waste will have more than one method of disposal or recovery - you can also use the add new waste details to an existing consignment from the main screen ‘save’, then ‘exit’ see guidance on how to complete the return for: consignments from Scotland and Northern Ireland waste received without a consignment note wastes you rejected consignments notes containing incorrect information once you’ve added all consignments recheck all the information you’ve entered to make sure it’s correct. Common errors include: data entered in tonnes instead of kg producer postcode incorrect once you’ve checked the information press ‘ validate ’ to identify some types of incorrect information - these must be corrected before sending to the Environment Agency click on the ‘main menu’ tab on the bottom left of the page create the return click on the ‘create return’ button to create and save the output file and note the name upload to sharefile or email hazwastereturn@environment-agency.gov.uk It’s an offence to submit incomplete, false or misleading data – you need robust quality control procedures to deliver complete and accurate information. Copy from your own spreadsheet If you copy and paste consignment note information from your own records to the Environment Agency returns spreadsheet you must: make sure you use the same order and format use the same units, eg kg ensure there’s no missing data Use ‘validate’ to spot mistakes This will help identify data errors made: when entering information on the spreadsheet on consignment notes Minimise mistakes by having: staff training and quality controls checks at the waste acceptance stage, so you immediately spot consignment note errors and address them with the producer (for parts A, B and D), and the carrier (for part C) Consignee returns: reduced reporting and charges For certain waste movements the Environment Agency accepts reduced reporting and charging requirements. This position only applies: to the wastes listed below for the first movement of the hazardous waste from the premises where it is produced to a permitted or exempt consignee where the other requirements of the hazardous waste regulations have been fully complied with, eg use of consignment note where the consignment note coding standard (XXXXXX/YYYYYD) has been used - see the guidance on consignment Hazardous waste moved without a consignment note cannot benefit from reduced reporting requirements and charges. Wastes with reduced reporting requirements Code: 16 05 04* aerosol air fresheners from washrooms 20 01 33* dry cell portable batteries 20 01 21* 16 02 13* 16 02 15* 20 01 35* fluorescent tubes and other lighting equipment 16 06 01* lead acid motor vehicle batteries - applies only to consignment of 5 or fewer batteries 20 01 19* pesticides (municipal) 14 06 01* recovered refrigerant gases 18 02 02* 18 02 05* 18 02 07* veterinary waste from farms - applies only to consignments of waste taken from the farm to a veterinary practice for storage pending collection 16 01 04* un-depolluted end of life vehicles (ELVs) - applies only where the first movement is direct to an authorised treatment facility (ATF) 15 01 10* empty unclean packaging destined for reconditioning, remanufacturing or rebottling under an environmental permit (not exemptions) - for this position, remanufacturing means only processes where the original core components of the packaging are reused any, small samples of waste being sent to laboratories for analysis the first movement is the place where the sample was taken or produced applies to samples produced as part of a recognised quality assurance scheme 20 01 35* with 20 01 36 small mixed waste electrical and electronic equipment ( WEEE ) from domestic households excludes other separately collected WEEE items, eg CRTs, monitors and flat screen TVs, refrigeration equipment, large domestic appliances, batteries and fluorescent lamps place of production is a household WEEE collection point (civic amenity site, bring bank, or a shop offering in store take back) unsorted loads must be classified as both 20 01 35* and 20 01 36 unless hazardous items and components have been identified and removed Consignment note return: how to complete for wastes with reduced reporting requirements To complete the consignee return for these wastes follow these steps: Produce a new consignment note code using XXXXXX/YYYYYD format, where: XXXXXX/YYYYY is the standard consignment note code format, generated using the consignee site information ‘D’ identifies that you are using reduced reporting requirements Enter that consignment note code in the consignee return and: mark the type of consignment as ‘single’ enter date received as the last day of the quarter, in the format DD/MM/YYYY use postcode for the consignee site Enter the List of Waste code for each waste you received with reduced reporting requirements (for example use 20 01 21* for fluorescent tubes) and then enter the: total quantity (kg) of each List of Waste code received during that quarter recovery or disposal code for the activity you applied to the waste physical form of the waste hazardous properties for the waste (HP1 to HP15, and POP) An Environment Agency regulatory position means it will not normally take enforcement action for failure to report these waste movements in full unless: other hazardous waste requirements are not complied with activity has caused, or is likely to cause pollution or harm to health You cannot reduce your reporting requirement and charges for unconsigned movements of hazardous waste. Consignments from Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland Enter consignments from Wales on your return in the same way as those from England. Consignments from Scotland and Northern Ireland: change the consignment note code There are 4 differences in how you record the information. You need to: remove the first letter from the code add ‘SC’ for Scotland or ‘NI’ for Northern Ireland at the start of the code if the remaining code is 1 letter and 8 numbers add ‘SC’ for Scotland or ‘NI’ for Northern Ireland at the start of the code, and add ‘0’ (zero) after the third letter if the remaining code is 1 letter and 7 numbers add ‘/’ after the first 6 digits For example, SA3876543 becomes SCA038/76543. ‘Type of consignment’ must be ‘single’ Multiple collections apply only to England or Wales. If the consignment was a carrier’s round collecting waste(s) from several producers Do not enter each individual collection, instead enter the: details of any one producer total quantity of each waste type collected in the round Returns for rejected waste You must report rejected waste on your quarterly return – even if your site has no permit to accept that hazardous waste type. There are no fees for rejected wastes you report. For rejected waste with a consignment note: at ‘mode of disposal’ enter ‘REJ’ enter all other details (including quantity) as if you accepted the waste For rejected waste with no consignment note: use the REJECT/YYYYY code and other information from the record you created when you rejected the waste at ‘mode of disposal’ enter ‘REJ’ If you rejected but afterwards accepted it, enter 2 returns, one for the: rejected load, using the rejected consignment note code accepted load, using the code and other required information from the new consignment note - the new note will have the correct classification and description and the relevant recovery or disposal code in the ‘mode of disposal’ field See rejected loads guidance – accept rejected waste . There is a charge for the accepted load. If you rejected a waste because it was misclassified/described as hazardous waste, but subsequently accepted it as non-hazardous, you only need report the rejected ‘hazardous’ load. Consignment note errors Your return must have complete and accurate information. You must ensure that: your waste acceptance procedures identify incomplete or inaccurate consignment notes you follow rejected load rules - see rejected loads guidance If you identify the error after you accept the waste (after signing part E of the note) in the return, you must: enter the original incorrect information against the relevant consignment note number enter the corrected information against a new consignment note number (as if it were a rejected load) - the new number is the original number with an ‘R’ added at the end, ie XXXXXX/YYYYYR You must keep an additional record in your register of what: information was wrong on the original note you did to identify the correct information and prevent the error recurring with respect to the producer, holder, carrier or consignor action you’ve taken to improve your waste acceptance Mistakes and omissions on returns If your return has wrong information, or you’ve not included one or more consignments, you must: correct and resubmit your return telephone the Environment Agency on 03708 506 506 (call charges) and ask them to cancel the existing return. Confirm this by email to hazwastereturn@environment-agency.gov.uk Self disposal returns If you dispose of your own hazardous waste by depositing it on the site where it was produced, you must send a consignee return providing details of this. This applies to activities: D01: putting the waste into or onto land D02: land treatment D03: deep injection D04: surface impoundment D05: putting the waste into a special landfill designed for that waste D06: releasing waste into a lake or river D12: permanently storing the waste You do not need to provide a return to the Environment Agency for temporary storage at the premises of production that meets the conditions of that exemption. To record self disposal waste on a consignee return, you first need to create a consignment note code in the format XXXXXX/YYYYYS, where: XXXXXX/YYYYY is the standard consignment note code format for that premises - see consignment note guidance ‘S’ identifies that you are making a self disposal return Then enter this consignment on your returns spreadsheet by: clicking ‘single’ at ‘type of consignment’ entering the last day of the quarter period where it says ‘date received’ at ‘quantity (kilograms)’, entering the total quantity of each waste you disposed of at your site during the quarter completing all other information as you would for a regular consignment return Other ways to send your return XML Send this to the Environment Agency by email at hazwastereturn@environment-agency.gov.uk (do not use this email address for enquiries). If you need help to create an XML return, telephone 03708 506 506, (call charges) . By post You can get a paper form and guidance from the Environment Agency - call 03708 506 506, (call charges) . Charges for paper returns are higher than for electronic returns – it is £19 for each single consignment and £10 for each multiple consignment. Producer or holder returns The consignee must send a return to the producer or holder of the waste entered in part A2 on the consignment note. If the consignor is not the producer or holder, you must also send them a return. The return tells them what happened to their waste. You can create a return in one of two ways: use the format set out in the regulations send both a copy of the fully completed consignment note and a description or confirmation of the disposal or recovery method for each waste on the consignment - required because part E of the note is completed when the waste is received before the operation starts Where the producer/holder and consignee are part of the same organisation a return must still be sent and held in the producer/holder register.

/government/collections/crc-energy-efficiency-scheme,"The CRC Scheme aims to incentivise energy efficiency and cut emissions in large energy users in the UK's public and private sectors.  CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme  Environment Agency Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy Overview The information on this page is for participants in the CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme (formerly known as the “Carbon Reduction Commitment”), which will be closed following the 2018-19 compliance year. The scheme applies to large energy users in the public and private sectors across the UK, including supermarkets, water companies, banks, local authorities and all central government departments. Organisations that meet the qualification criteria are required to participate, and must buy allowances for every tonne of carbon they emit. In the Budget on 16 March 2016, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced that the government has decided to close the CRC scheme following the 2018-19 compliance year. Doing this will significantly streamline the business energy tax landscape by replacing it, in a revenue neutral way, with an increase in the Climate Change Levy. Organisations will report under the CRC for the last time by the end of July 2019 and surrender allowances for emissions from energy supplied in the 2018-19 compliance year by the end of October 2019. Further information can be found in the Government’s response to the consultation: Reforming the Business Energy Efficiency Tax Landscape Qualification A summary of steps to determine whether your organisation qualifies for participation in the CRC and more information on qualification are to be found on the Environment Agency CRC webpages . Compliance requirements Organisations which participate within the CRC are required to monitor their energy use, and report their energy supplies annually. The Environment Agency’s reporting system applies emissions factors to calculate participants’ carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions on the basis of this information. Participants must purchase and surrender allowances for their emissions. Allowances can either be bought at annual fixed-price sales, or traded on the secondary market. One allowance must be surrendered for each tonne of CO2 emitted. CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme Order: table of conversion factors In the current phase, participants have the option of buying allowances in advance in the lower price ‘forecast sale’ at the start of a compliance year, or in a higher price ‘compliance sale’ after the end of the year. For the current phase, the following prices have been announced: CRC Scheme Year Forecast Sale Price Compliance Sale Price 2014/15 £15.60 £16.40 2015/16 £15.60 £16.90 2016/17 £16.10 £17.20* 2017/18 £16.60* £17.70* 2018/19 £17.20* £18.30* *Specific provision has not yet been made in the legislation for the prices to be paid in the compliance sale period for 2016/2017 and in the forecast and compliance sale periods for 2017/2018 and 2018/19. Budget 2016 announced that sale prices would increase by RPI up until the closure of the scheme at the end of the 2018/19 compliance year - the provisions to enact the prices marked with a * set out in the table above will be made in due course, subject to Parliamentary approval. Please note: the Government has no plans to change the forecast sale price for 2016/17 of £16.10 stated above. DECC (via its payment provider SSCL) wrote to CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme participants who purchased allowances in the April 2015 forecast sale to notify them that they will be entitled to a refund of 50 pence per allowance purchased in that sale. This was due to an administrative error. The table above was amended to reflect the correct forecast sale price for 2015/16 (£15.60). Only those participants who purchased allowances in the April 2015 forecast sale received details of next steps from SSCL. Further information about the refund and next steps was provided in the Q&A Document. Further information about the refund and next steps can be found in the Q&A Document . More information on reporting and allowance sales is available on the Environment Agency CRC webpages . Further guidance Official guidance on all aspects of complying with the CRC Scheme is available from the Environment Agency web pages.

'Raw' laser data can build better city models  Environment Agency LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) surveys are carried out by the Environment Agency to help with flood modelling and tracking changing coastal habitats. These aerial surveys collect hundreds of millions (sometimes billions) of point heights from bouncing a laser off the landscape. Three-dimensional ‘point cloud’ data is now being made freely available for any use and can help to build highly-detailed models of urban environments. The release of LIDAR point cloud data began in March 2016 and by the end of July the Environment Agency aims to make all 725 gigabytes of its point cloud archive, covering 175,000 square kilometres of England, available on DATA.GOV.UK In January this year start-up Emu Analytics used Environment Agency LIDAR data in an interactive map enabling people to easily see heights of buildings across London and at the end of June released a similar map using these data showing building heights across the majority of England Jonathan Smith, Head of Data Insight at Emu Analytics, said: It is superb for start-ups like us that the Environment Agency is making its LIDAR point cloud available as open data. Point cloud data is a step up in terms of the level of detail we can achieve in modelling infrastructure and the natural environment. We are able to define the shapes of buildings and vegetation and even discover temporary infrastructure, such as cranes. With the detail that point cloud provides we will be able to open up new use cases and offerings such as providing clutter data for line-of-site broadband companies or calculating the shadows nearby buildings would cast on a proposed array of solar panels. In general the whole Open Defra ecosystem, within which point cloud sits, allows start-ups such as ourselves to easily work with the data, enrich it, and where possible, provide it back to the open data community. Since the Environment Agency began releasing its LIDAR surveys as open data in September 2015 these data have found many surprising uses including helping archaeologists to discover ‘lost’ Roman roads and Minecraft enthusiasts to build virtual worlds. With point cloud data users can create their own customised elevation models incorporating additional information about the type of ground feature (vegetation or hard surface) being surveyed, or the time the survey was conducted."

Severn Trent Water had previously pleaded guilty to the charges at Nottingham Magistrates Court on 25 November 2015. Proceedings were brought by the Environment Agency following repeated pollution incidents where crude sewage leaked into the Shire Brook on the border of Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire on three separate occasions. The incidents occurred on 9 May 2013, 17 December 2013 and 29 April 2014. The Severn Trent sewer that transported raw sewage had backed up and leaked into the surface water drain that led to the Shire Brook on the first two occasions. The April 2014 leak saw thick sewage sludge and solids on the hillside, ‘sewage pools’ at ground level and grey water and sewage fungus in the brook. This was due to a blocked combined sewer. In passing sentence, the Judge stated in respect of incident 1 that it was not sufficient for Severn Trent Water to rely on the absence of any previous incident to negate the need for any further action. There was a known risk and Severn Trent’s approach was insufficiently proactive. There was a degree of past economic benefit to Severn Trent. There was a significant effect on the water quality, however it was short-lived in time. In respect of incident three, there was a failure by Severn Trent as a whole to take reasonable care and enforce proper systems for avoiding the commission of this offence. They were therefore negligent. The risks were entirely foreseeable and Severn Trent did not proactively investigate the sewers in response. In mitigation the Judge found that Severn Trent had expressed regret and apologised for the three incidents. On each occasion the company had enacted a swift and effective clean-up operation. Speaking after the case, an Environment Agency officer involved with the investigation said: Severn Trent Water has a responsibility to inspect and maintain its sewers, and the discharge of raw sewage into the same brook three times within 12 months is more than unfortunate. This is one of the largest fines ever to be imposed on Severn Trent and I hope it sends a strong message that it is far more cost effective to avoid these incidents, as we will continue to take action against companies and individuals where they ignore their responsibilities. In the last financial year Severn Trent’s turnover increased from £1.5 billion to £1.8 billion, with a pre-tax and interest profit of £512.6 million. The fines imposed were outside the ranges suggested within Sentencing Councils Guidelines in order to send out the necessary message to Severn Trent Water and its shareholders."

/guidance/water-management-abstract-or-impound-water,"If you abstract or impound water or plan to do so, you may need to apply for an abstraction or impoundment licence.     Water management: abstract or impound water Water Environment Agency Local water availability The Environment Agency manages over 20,000 abstraction and impoundment licences across England to balance water availability and water demand. Applications to abstract (take) water are assessed against local water availability. The approach is set out in Abstraction Licensing Strategies ( ALS ). To see how much water is available in your river catchment area and understand the likelihood of your application being successful, view your local ALS . Water abstraction Taking water from a surface source (such as a river, stream or canal) or from an underground source is called abstraction. If you plan to take more than 20 cubic metres a day, you will almost certainly need an abstraction licence from the Environment Agency. Before you apply for a water abstraction licence Before you apply for a new water abstraction licence or to change an existing licence you should: check the ALS for your area – this may indicate the likelihood of your application succeeding complete the water abstraction or impoundment preliminary enquiry form to get pre-application advice from the Environment Agency Abstractions that don’t need a licence You don’t need a licence or need to register an exemption for: abstractions of 20 cubic metres or less a day, provided your abstraction is part of a single operation; if you abstract from the same source at multiple points, the exemption only applies if the combined total of all abstractions is 20 cubic metres or less a day some land drainage operations (for example, flood protection) filling ships or boats with drinking or ballast water water used for fire fighting abstractions in relation to dewatering quarries, mines and other building or engineering operations trickle irrigation (some trickle irrigation projects are considered ‘relevant projects’ for the purposes of the Water Resources (Environmental Impact Assessment) (England and Wales) Regulations 2003 (as amended) and therefore require Environment Agency consent If you are unsure or believe your activity is a ‘relevant project’, contact the Environment Agency . Types of abstraction licence The different types of abstraction licence are: full licence – for most types of abstraction over 20 cubic metres a day transfer licence – for moving over 20 cubic metres of water a day from one source of supply to another without intervening use temporary licence – for abstractions over 20 cubic metres a day over a period of less than 28 days Duration of licences Abstraction licences may have a time limit linked to a common end date. You can find this in the ALS for the area you are in. When the Environment Agency grants a licence for the first time, it is likely to be for between 6 and 18 years. When they renew a licence it will normally be for another 12 years. They may also grant short duration licences where they think there may be issues with the licence or water availability in the longer term, or if you only need it for a short time. In certain circumstances, they will consider granting licences for up to 24 years. Long duration licence If you need to abstract water for a period of up to 24 years, when you apply you will have to demonstrate (through a business case) that: the lifetime of the infrastructure (for example, pumps, pipe work, reservoirs) inseparably associated with the licence will extend over the desired duration of the licence you continuously need the service or product the infrastructure supplies throughout the duration of the licence you have assessed the likely environmental and economic changes that may affect the abstraction over the duration of the licence and the assessment shows no significant concerns (if an environmental impact assessment is required under planning law, this may suffice – alternatively you will need to provide an environmental assessment) the infrastructure contributes to sustainable development Licence renewal If your current abstraction licence is due to expire, and you want to continue to abstract, you need to apply for a new licence at least 3 months before the existing licence expires. Trading water rights An abstraction licence gives its holder a right to abstract water. If you are unable to get your own abstraction licence, you may be able to enter into an agreement with an existing licence holder for them to give you part or all of their abstraction right permanently or temporarily. This is called the trading of water rights. If you already have an abstraction licence, you can agree to give the rights to some or all of that water to someone else. The trading of water rights will usually require the parties involved to apply to the Environment Agency for a new licence and to change or cancel (revoke) any existing licence. The Environment Agency will: make information available about abstractions, water availability and its approach to licensing advise before an application about whether proposed trading is likely to be licensed The Environment Agency is unable to act as a broker or negotiate the trading of licences. Find a trading partner You need to make your own arrangements to find someone to trade with. High level details of abstraction licences are available in ‘ what’s in your backyard ’. You can contact the Environment Agency to find out where you can view more licence details in the water resources public register, for free. Types of trade There are 4 different trading scenarios. These are: whole, permanent – the whole of the trader’s abstraction right is transferred to the recipient on a permanent basis whole, temporary – the whole of the trader’s abstraction right is transferred to the recipient on a temporary basis part, permanent – part of the trader’s abstraction right is transferred to the recipient on a permanent basis part, temporary – part of the trader’s abstraction right is transferred to the recipient on a temporary basis Further guidance on trading water rights is available. Impoundment An impoundment is a structure within inland waters that can permanently or temporarily change the water level or flow. This includes: dams weirs fish passes hydropower turbines sluices penstocks culverts lock gates retaining walls flumes reservoir embankments temporary diversions during construction work You must have an impoundment licence before you start to work on an impoundment structure, even in an emergency, unless one of the exemptions below applies. Impoundments that don’t need a licence There are several exemptions where an impoundment licence is not needed. These are: works constructed without a licence before 1 April 2006, except where a notice is served by the Environment Agency requiring application for a licence where a public authority that manages or owns waterways or harbours constructs any new impoundment, alters an existing impoundment or obstructs or impedes the flow of inland waters while exercising its powers or undertaking its duties where the impoundment is authorised by a drought order or drought permit where the persons doing the works are Crown exempt where structures and works are authorised by legislation (for example an act of Parliament) where the Environment Agency serves notice requiring impoundment only for the purpose of screening or passage for eels Low risk impoundment activities Some impoundment activities have little impact on the environment and other water users. The Environment Agency will not normally require a licence application for: fish easements or passes that have formal written approval by the Environment Agency and do not significantly affect the distribution of flow over the weir placing a notch in a weir to encourage fish migration placing woody debris across part of the channel to diversify flows flap valves that only operate during flooding fixed control or passive flood prevention structures within the channel that only hold back flood water (structures with movable gates or sluices require an impoundment licence) small measurement structures, such as v-notch or small rectangular weirs The Environment Agency will not normally require a licence application for: refurbishing a sluice re-pointing (block work structures) repairs (for example to expansion joint, stone pitching or bank/wall) void filling (‘solid’ structures) managing vegetation de-silting re-positioning (rock, rubble or block work bank protection structures) replacing elements that do not contribute to phased replacement of the whole structure re-facing skimming/covering blockage removal, including screen clearing embankment grouting Other activities that will not normally require a licence are: works that temporarily divert water during construction or maintenance of a structure and do not affect any other water users, rights or the environment impounding works or changes to the impoundment to reduce or avoid an immediate threat to human life, property or the environment during an emergency any activity outside the channel, for example on top of the river banks, such as installing or maintaining bridge supports or flood defences work in the river, parallel and adjacent to the bank that doesn’t significantly narrow the channel, for example installing sheet piling, rip rap and rock revetments for erosion protection installing a wave wall on an existing reservoir dam that is not intended to impound any extra water increasing the height of spillway sidewalls (that does not alter the impounding level) altering, moving or constructing a spillway without increasing the impounded level or changing the downstream flow regime to the detriment of the environment Low risk impoundment checklist You should keep a record of your checklist for your own records. It is also evidence in a proper assessment that you don’t need to have a licence. If the answer to all of the following questions is ‘no’ then you are unlikely to require a licence: do surveys reveal any existing abstractions, including unlicensed ones, which may be affected by the proposal are there any other water users or riparian rights or interests that may be affected will the changes cause parts of the weir to suffer significantly reduced flows is the proposal within, or likely to have an impact on a Site of Special Scientific Interest, Special Area of Conservation, Special Protected Area or Ramsar site are planned changes in river flow likely to cause significant change to invertebrate habitats does the proposal affect protected species (not fish) that may live at the site or elsewhere in the catchment are planned changes in the river flow likely to cause a significant change in the macrophyte and diatom communities will the proposal impact on either the up or downstream passage of fish (including eels) in the river will the proposal impact on any fish spawning or nursery areas will the proposal cause sediment movement or deposition to be substantially altered above or below the site will pollutants be discharged or mobilised into the river during construction and/or operation is the proposal likely to significantly increase river turbidity or significantly alter movement of sediment does the scheme involve construction of a new raised reservoir with the capacity of 25,000 cubic metres or more will the proposal cause erosion of the river banks up or down stream If you are in any doubt about whether you need an impoundment licence, contact the Environment Agency for more information: Before you apply for an impoundment licence Before you apply for a new licence or change an existing licence you should: check the ALS for your area – this may indicate the likelihood of your application succeeding complete the water impoundment preliminary enquiry form to get pre-application advice from the Environment Agency Impoundment licences do not have a time limit.  Apply for a water abstraction or impoundment licence"

/government/news/annual-flood-siren-testing-planned-in-grimsby-and-cleethorpes,"Annual testing of the Environment Agency’s flood sirens in Grimsby and Cleethorpes will be carried out next week.  Annual flood siren testing planned in Grimsby and Cleethorpes  Environment Agency The 18 sirens help warn more than 25,000 households and local businesses of imminent tidal flooding from the Humber. The siren on the Willows Estate, Grimsby, is used to warn residents about flooding from the River Freshney. Testing will take place on Friday, 26 August between 10am and 12pm. If you hear the sirens during this time, you do not need to take any action. If flooding was expected on the day, the test would be rescheduled and warnings would be issued through the Environment Agency’s Floodline Warnings Direct system. If a severe flood warning was issued, the sirens would also be sounded. The sirens are secondary to the Environment Agency’s Floodline Warnings Direct Service, which provides targeted flooding information via phone call or text to mobile or landlines, or through email. Luke Dawson, Flood Resilience Team Leader with the Environment Agency, said: “The Floodline Warnings Direct service gives people as much notice as possible of potential flooding. Our flood sirens are another way we can warn of imminent flooding, so it’s important that we test them to make sure they will work during an emergency. “However, the best way to reduce your own risk is to sign up for our free, targeted flood warnings by calling 0345 988 1188.” Environment Agency staff will be in the Freshney Place shopping centre on Friday, 26 August from 9am to 5pm to answer questions about the sirens and flood risk, including what steps people can take to prepare for an emergency. Luke continued: “Our flood defences reduce the risk of flooding to thousands of homes and businesses in Grimsby and Cleethorpes, but no defence can ever completely remove all flood risk, so it’s important for people to know what to do before, during and after a flood to protect themselves and their property. “We’d welcome anyone in the area to come and see us at Freshney Place to learn more.” Steven Coe, Lead Flood Risk Management Officer at North East Lincolnshire Council (the lead local flood authority) said: “During the flood siren testing due to take place, North East Lincolnshire Council staff and its partner Engie will be joining the Environment Agency in Freshney Place Shopping Centre between 9am and 5pm. We will be available to answer any questions on flood risk and how you can prepare.”"

/guidance/hazardous-waste-consignment-note-supplementary-guidance,"What information the consignment note must contain, who has to complete each part and when it has to be completed.  Hazardous waste: consignment note guidance Waste Environment Agency From 1 April 2016, premises no longer need to register as hazardous waste producers. This change affects the entire hazardous waste control system. This guidance applies from 1 April 2016. Overview Consignment is only one part of the control system for hazardous waste. If you produce, transport or manage hazardous waste you must follow all the rules of the control system. See the guidance on hazardous waste . When consignment notes are needed When hazardous waste is moved it must be accompanied by correctly completed paperwork called a consignment note. The note must be prepared before it’s moved. A note is needed for all movements of hazardous waste, including: collections from businesses by registered waste carriers movements from one premises to another within the same business movements from customer premises, where another business has produced waste A consignment note is not needed to move hazardous waste for: the movement of domestic hazardous waste (other than asbestos waste ) from a domestic household to an initial collection point waste imported or exported under international waste shipment controls which uses a different movement note See the information on unusual circumstances . Layout and information fields To be valid the consignment note must include all the information fields and be as near as possible to the format in the example note. An example of a completed note will be available soon. Do not use any note if: information fields are missing or have been altered to reduce/change what is required – for example e-mail, phone or weight is missing declarations are worded differently the format is different - for example it does not have separate tables in Part B and E If you have any concerns about the validity of a note telephone the Environment Agency on 03708 506 506 (see call charges ). Complete the consignment note The consignment note has 5 parts (A to E). Each part must be filled out in order, by the right person, at the right time: Step 1: producer or holder completes parts A and B The producer or holder of the waste must complete parts A and B on each copy of the note before the waste is removed. Give all copies to the carrier. Part A: notification details You must provide details of the origin and destination of the waste in Parts A1 to A4. A1. Consignment note code If you are a producer or holder of hazardous waste and your premises, on 31 March 2016, had a valid premises registration number (or did not require registration), you may continue to use the old coding standard until 30 June 2016. If your registration number expired before 31 March 2016, you must use the new coding standard from 1 April 2016. You must create a consignment note code and enter it onto the consignment note. The format for the consignment note code must be ‘XXXXXX/YYYYY. The: ‘XXXXXX’ is the first 6 letters/numbers (not symbols or spaces) of the name of the company entered in part A2 of the consignment note and must be followed by ‘/’ ‘YYYYY’ is exactly 5 numbers or letters (not symbols or spaces) you choose For example, CJTILE/A0001. Each code can only be used once from the address in part A2. You must change the ‘YYYYY’ to create a different code each time waste is consigned from that premises. Note: If your company name has less than 6 letters/numbers you must assign the letter ‘Q’ to remaining characters. You must also assign an additional letter at the end of the consignment note code for certain types of consignment. Add: a ‘V’ to waste removed from ships - ‘XXXXXX/YYYYYV’ an ‘F’ to fly-tipped waste - ‘XXXXXX/YYYYYF’ a ‘D’ to waste moving under a consignee return derogation - ‘XXXXXX/YYYYYD’ a ‘P’ to continuous piped waste, see further information Additional letters are also assigned to rejected loads. See the guidance on rejected loads . The consignment note form contains 2 extra grey boxes for these additional letters, the second may be needed for rejected loads. A2. The waste described below is to be removed from (name, address, postcode, telephone, email, facsimile) You must enter all of the required details for the premises from which the waste is being removed and: if the premises do not have a postcode, give the nearest full postcode you may only omit telephone, email or facsimile if the premises do not have them - in which case you should enter ‘N/A’ A3. The waste will be taken to (name, address and postcode) You must enter the name, address and postcode of the place your waste is to be taken to (the consignee). You should first check that the consignee holds an environmental permit, or exemption from a permit, that allows them to accept the type(s) of waste being consigned. A4. The waste producer was (if different from A2) (name, address, postcode, telephone, email, facsimile) This field is important if the waste was not produced by the organisation entered in A2. For example, if the waste was produced by a contractor or the organisation in A2 is an on-site facilities management company. You must put either one of these - enter: ‘as A2’ if the producer is the same details of the waste producer if different from that in A2 Part B: description of the waste You must provide information about the waste, the activity that produced it, its composition, properties and its packaging in Part B1 to B3. B1. The process giving rise to the waste and B2 SIC for the process giving rise to the waste You must provide a full written description and the Standard Industrial Classification SIC 2007 code of the process that created the waste. If you operate more than one process, this may be different to the SIC code for your main process. If the wastes on the note are produced by more than one process, use the SIC code and description of the process that produced most of the waste. You may use equivalent NACE codes here instead. B3. Waste details For each different type of waste being collected you must enter details of the: waste description: this must be a full description of each waste - the short description from the list of wastes (LoW) is not normally sufficient LoW or European Waste Catalogue (EWC) code 6 digits: the 6 digit list of waste code(s) for the waste quantity (kg): you must provide the total weight in kg for each hazardous LoW code - the weight entered must be accurate, if you use conversion factors for volumes of liquids or containers you must ensure that they are reliable chemical/biological components of the waste and their concentrations: you must describe the chemical (or biological) composition of the waste including both hazardous and non-hazardous items - for many products (such as paint) this will be listed in section 3 of the Safety Data Sheet physical form (gas, liquid, solid, powder, sludge or mixed): enter the one that best describes the waste hazard code(s): you must identify which hazardous properties the waste possesses - you must work this out and must: not omit properties the waste does possess not include properties the waste does not possess use the code ‘POP’ for persistent organic pollutants See the detail in the waste classification guidance . container type, number and size: you must enter this (for example 3 x 205L metal drum) - if a larger container contains smaller containers of different hazardous wastes you must also enter this information for the smaller containers UN identification number(s), proper shipping name(s), UN class(es), packaging group(s) and special handling requirements: this information is required for the transport of dangerous goods - further information is available from the Health and Safety Executive website Step 2: carrier checks parts A and B, and completes part C The carrier must check parts A and B of the note, and complete part C after the producer or holder has completed parts A and B and before the waste is removed. Once you have signed part C you must hand all copies back to the consignor, producer or holder. Checking part A: waste details You must (as a minimum) do duty of care checks to confirm the waste details given by the producer/holder in Part B3 are correct and fully completed. You should not sign Part C (or remove the waste) if any of the details are incomplete or incorrect. Checking part B: the journey You are confirming that you are collecting the waste from the premises listed in A2, and taking it directly to the destination listed in A3. The note is only valid for the journey shown. Part C: carrier certificate By completing Part C the carrier is doing 2 things. It is: confirming they have checked the details provided by the producer/holder in Parts A and B entering their own details Entering vehicle and carrier details The note is valid only for the carrier company using the specific vehicle indicated on the note. If more than one carrier or vehicle is used you should use a carrier schedule. Telephone 03708 506 506 (see call charges ) for more information. Multiple collection details (where relevant) A multiple collection is a journey that meets all of the following criteria. It is: hazardous waste collected from 2 or more different premises in England and Wales - at least one premises must be in England in a single journey by a single waste carrier when all the waste is taken to the same consignee If these criteria are met you must enter a round number and collection number in Part C of the note in the format ‘XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX’/’YY’ where the: round number ‘XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX’ is any alphanumeric code identifying the collection round, up to a maximum of 15 characters (it may contain a ‘/’ or ‘-‘, but must not contain a space). You must agree this number with the consignee to ensure it is unique to them collection number ‘YY’ is a numeric code of 1 or 2 digits that identifies the order of collection within the round. The first premises from which waste is collected is ‘01’ or ‘1’, the second ‘02’ or ‘2’ and so on A reduced charge is made to consignees for receipt of multiple collections. Step 3: consignor checks parts A, B and C and completes part D The consignor (producer or holder) must be present when the waste is collected by the carrier. They consignor must confirm that the information the producer or holder entered into Parts A and B, and the carrier entered into Part C is correct. Part D: consignor’s certificate – information you must confirm Part D must be completed by the consignor after the carrier has completed Part C but before the waste is removed. The consignor must be present when the waste is collected. The carrier cannot complete Part D for you. You must check and confirm each of the 6 points before completing Part D: I certify that: the information in A, B and C has been completed and is correct – the person signing the note must have sufficient knowledge to certify this and be present when the waste is collected to check the carrier’s vehicle registration number the carrier is registered – you must check that the carrier is registered. Find a registered waste carrier I was advised of the appropriate precautionary measures – you have a duty to give the carrier any precautionary measures needed for the waste material all of the waste is packaged and labelled correctly - and is in line with carriage of dangerous goods requirements for transport the carrier has been advised of any special handling requirements – you have a duty to inform the carrier of any special handling requirements I confirm that: I have fulfilled my duty to apply the waste hierarchy as required by Regulation 12 of the Waste (England and Wales) Regulations 2011 – see the waste hierarchy guidance . 1. Consignor name This must be the name of the person who supervises the carrier collection and signs the note. On behalf of (name, address, postcode, telephone, email, facsimile) If you are employed by the business listed in Part A2 of the note write ‘as A2’. Otherwise provide the full address and contact details of the business that you work for. Signature, date, time The consignor signs the note and enters the date and time (using 24-hour clock) of signing. Step 4: the consignee receives the waste from the carrier On arrival the carrier gives the consignee 2 copies of the note. The consignee: checks the waste and the note and either accepts or rejects the waste completes part E to confirm they have checked the delivery of waste and whether it has been accepted or rejected Checking the waste and the note You may commit an offence if you accept a hazardous waste without a consignment note, or if the consignment note is incomplete or incorrect. You must check both the waste and its accompanying documentation to ensure it is correct and complete before you accept the waste. You must reject the waste if: the waste isn’t accompanied by a consignment note - unless you are able to confirm that the movement legally doesn’t need a consignment note your site isn’t identified as the destination site in part A3 of the consignment note your site isn’t authorised to accept the waste the waste is inaccurately or incompletely classified or described the vehicle delivering the waste isn’t the one identified in Part C of the note and there isn’t a schedule of carriers form recording a transfer to it the consignment note doesn’t contain all the information fields required and isn’t set out in substantially the same format Part A to D of the consignment note has been amended in any way, unless you have contacted the consignor and confirmed that the: person responsible for completing that part, or a person authorised by them, made the amendment change happened before the carrier and consignor certified it change happened before the waste was removed You should keep a record of this correspondence in your register. You must not amend or correct any information in Parts A, B, C or D of the note. If you reject the waste, you must follow the rules in the rejected loads guidance . Rejecting a waste does not always mean you have to send the carrier and waste away. The rules set out how you must manage the waste and may provide you with a means to accept the waste in certain circumstances. Part E: consignee certificate – information you must provide You must enter the: individual EWC code(s) received – check the waste is as classified and described in Part B then enter the code if correct - if the code in Part B is incorrect, you must reject the waste and provide an explanation under number 3 quantity of each code received (in kg) – weigh the waste or otherwise accurately determine the quantity you received in kg – don’t copy the quantity collected from part B EWC code accepted/rejected – enter whether you accept or reject each code received waste management operation ( R or D code ) – enter the waste recovery or disposal operation you will apply to the waste at your site using its R or D code 1. I received this waste at the address given in A3 on Check your site is the one listed in Part A3 of the note. If so, enter the date and time the waste was received. 2. Vehicle registration number (or mode of transport if not road) Enter the registration number of the vehicle delivering the waste and check that it matches that given in Part C or, where applicable, a schedule of carriers form. 3. Where waste is rejected please provide details Give the reason why you rejected the waste. Name:……on behalf of (name, address, postcode, telephone, email, facsimile) You must enter your name, the name of your company, and the address and contact details for the site receiving the waste. I certify that the waste permit/exempt waste operation number: …….. authorises the management of the waste described in B at the address given in A3 You must check the site’s authorisation (permit or exemption) number allows it to accept the waste for the intended Recovery or Disposal (R or D) operation. If waste is misclassified/described you must reject it. Enter permit or exemption reference number that authorises the intended R or D operation. Where the consignment forms part of a multiple collection, as identified in Part C, I certify that the total number of consignments forming the collection are If the consignment is part of a multiple collection, you must state the total number of consignments delivered to you as part of that multiple collection. Amending notes The information in Parts A, B, and C of the consignment note must not be changed after the carrier has agreed and signed it. The information in Parts A, B, C and D of the note must not be changed after the: consignor has certified it waste has been removed from the premises listed in A2 These changes make the note invalid. Only the party legally responsible for completion of each part of the note, or a person authorised by them to act on their behalf, can amend parts A, B, C or D. This must be done before certification of that information, and before removal of the waste. If the consignee identifies an error on the note when it is delivered to their site, they must not correct it or ask for it to be corrected. They must reject the waste. See the detail in the rejected loads guidance . Cross border movements Waste moving to England from Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales or Gibraltar As the producer, holder, carrier or consignor you must: use the consignment note of the country of origin, completed in line with their legislation provide a separate transport document where the consignment notes do not contain enough information to comply with carriage of dangerous goods requirements not send us a pre-notification copy As the consignee in England receiving the waste, you must: also send a completed copy of the note to the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) if the waste is from Scotland also send a completed copy of the note to the Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA) if the waste is from Northern Ireland follow our rejected loads procedure and also send a copy of the note to SEPA, NIEA, or Natural Resources Wales (NRW) if you reject a waste from Scotland, Northern Ireland or Wales still report all wastes received on consignee returns to the producer, and to the Environment Agency (normal charges apply) Waste moving to England from anywhere else except Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales or Gibraltar This is an international waste shipment and you must follow rules for the transfrontier shipment of waste . You can email the International Waste Shipments team for advice at shipments@environment-agency.gov.uk . Waste moving from England to Scotland or Northern Ireland (but not Wales) You must: prepare an additional copy of the note send this to SEPA or NIEA as appropriate, at least 72 hours before the waste is being moved – this is pre-notification then, consign the waste as per a movement within England comply with the requirements in Scotland or Northern Ireland if the consignee rejects the waste Waste moving from England to Wales You must follow the normal consignment note procedure for England. Consignment in unusual circumstances Additional coding standards Add an additional letter at the end of the consignment note code for certain types of consignment. Add: a ‘V’ to waste removed from ships - XXXXXX/YYYYYV an ‘F’ to fly-tipped waste - XXXXXX/YYYYYF a ‘D’ to waste moving under a consignee return derogation - XXXXXX/YYYYYD a ‘P’ to continuously piped waste Additional letters may also be assigned to consignment note codes when: waste is rejected, see the guidance on rejected loads returns are submitted, see the guidance on consignee returns Emergency services You are an emergency service responding to a genuine emergency which produced hazardous waste. You do not need to consign hazardous waste because the rules on emergency and grave danger apply Emergency services means the police, fire and ambulance services and includes contractors engaged by them. Community healthcare workers You are a healthcare or veterinary worker providing care directly to a domestic householder, or their pet, in the home or in similar settings in the community and produce hazardous waste. This is domestic waste and you can take it to another premises for collection, as a separated domestic fraction, without a consignment note. This excludes waste produced by mobile or temporary clinics, and from services provided to staff via their business or employer. Roadside vehicle maintenance You are a roadside vehicle breakdown service repairing domestic vehicles and produce hazardous waste. This is domestic waste and you can take it to another premises for collection, as a separated domestic fraction, without a consignment note. Advice for commercial vehicle breakdowns is being developed. This excludes waste produced by vehicle maintenance garages or equivalent. Highways, railways, waterways or utility infrastructure You must ensure that the transport of hazardous waste, by road, rail or water vehicle, from the place where it was produced is always accompanied by a consignment note. Where there is a clearly defined premises on the network, for example a station, depot, substation, pumping station, building or equivalent, then waste must be consigned when it is removed from those premises. The Environment Agency is developing guidance for the removal of waste where the premises is less clearly defined, for example highways, railway track, coastline (including beaches), waterways (including river banks), and diffuse infrastructure like lampposts, telegraph poles, pylons, cables, pipelines and equivalent. This will replace the regulatory position statement on premises notification, that no longer applies due to change in legislation. Fly-tipped waste You are a carrier asked to remove fly-tipped hazardous waste. You may act as a consignor on behalf of the holder provided you have written authorisation from the holder to do so. The only other circumstance where you may act in another role is for rejected loads - see the guidance on rejected loads . Asbestos waste from a domestic premises You are a contractor or mobile service and do one of the following: produce waste asbestos at a domestic premises are employed by the householder to collect asbestos waste from a domestic premises You must: consign the asbestos complete the consignment note as the waste producer enter your business name and the address of the domestic premises in part A2 use your business name to create the consignment note code Mobile services You are a mobile service producing hazardous waste at a customer premises, other than a domestic premises. You must: consign the hazardous waste when its removed from the customer premises enter the customer’s business name and address in part A2, and use this to create the consignment note code enter your business name and address in part A4 Further information You can call the Environment Agency on 03708 506 506 (see call charges ) to request guidance about: carrier schedules - where more than one carrier/vehicle is used waste moved by pipelines waste from a ship"

They represent experienced and diverse hubs at strategic locations around the coast of the UK. While the UK-wide geographical coverage of these partnerships is not entirely complete, they have generally developed in areas of intense land and marine activity where there are high levels of potential for conflict between stakeholders and users. A newly published report, commissioned from the Coastal Partnerships Network, which includes contributions from 40 English partnerships provides a technical analysis of the levels of activity and engagement within coastal partnerships. It also maps their spatial coverage around England in relation to marine plan areas. The report also provides the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats facing partnership working in each marine plan area. The main services delivered by coastal partnerships include stakeholder engagement, information dissemination, input to coastal and marine planning, policy and legislation, and facilitation.

/guidance/marking-of-fishing-gear-retrieval-and-notification-of-lost-gear,"How different types of fishing gear must be marked, what you must do if you lose your fishing gear, how to report lost fishing gear. Marking of fishing gear, retrieval and notification of lost gear Regulations, monitoring and enforcement Marine Management Organisation Introduction If you are the master of a Union fishing vessel and you are fishing using passive gear or beam trawls you must mark your fishing gear so that it is identifiable. The type of gear you use and whether you fish inside or outside territorial waters (the 12 nautical mile limit) will affect how you must mark your gear. For all types of fishing gear, if you lose it you must attempt to retrieve it. If you are unable to do so you must notify the UK fisheries authorities. Marking of fishing gear You must mark passive gear and beam trawls with the port letters and numbers ( PLN ) of your vessel. This applies to the gear in use and gear you are carrying on board your vessel. Gear Marking 0 - 6nm 6 - 12nm 12 - 200nm Beam Trawl PLN Yes Yes Yes Passive gear Label Yes Yes Yes Passive gear Marker Buoy Recommended Recommended Yes Passive gear IFCA* Yes     *Check with your local IFCA for any local marking requirements. Marking of fishing gear chart !@1 Beam trawls A beam trawl is any towed trawl where the mouth of the trawl is held open by a beam or similar device. This does not include scallop dredges. If you are fishing in European Union waters and use or carry on board a beam trawl you must clearly display your vessel’s PLN on every beam. Often this is welded onto the beam where it can easily be seen by an inspector. Passive gear Passive gear means any fishing gear where the catching operation does not require an active movement of the gear. Passive gear is also referred to as ‘static gear’. Passive gear includes: Set nets: Gillnets, entangling nets, trammel nets and trap nets Drift nets: Drifting gillnets and drifting trammel nets Lines and pots: Long lines, lines, pots and traps. A guide to these fishing gears is available from Seafish If you use or carry on board any of these types of gear you must mark it with labels and, additionally, if you operate outside territorial waters (the 12 nautical mile limit) you must use marker buoys. Labels In all EU waters you must mark any passive gear that you use or carry on board with a permanent label showing the PLN of your vessel. Each label must be: at least 75mm x 65mm in size made of durable material securely fixed to the gear and not removable You must not alter, cover up, conceal, efface or otherwise make a label illegible. You must attach the label to your gear as follows: nets: to the upper first row of meshes lines and longlines: at the point of contact with the mooring buoy pots and traps: on the ground rope marker buoys (where required): attached to the mast If your gear extends further than one nautical mile, you must attach labels (as above) at regular intervals so that there is a label at least every nautical mile. The UK fisheries authorities do not supply labels for fishing gear. Marker buoys If you use or carry on board passive gear in EU waters outside 12 nautical miles you must attach marker buoys to the gear in addition to labels . There are two types of buoy that must be used: end marker buoys and intermediary marker buoys . Both types of buoy must display the PLN of your vessel: as high above the water as possible so as to be clearly visible; and in contrasting colours (e.g. Black on orange) You must not alter or efface the marking or allow it to become illegible. If you fish inside the 12 nautical mile limit it is recommended that you use buoys marked with your vessel’s PLN so that your gear is easily identifiable. To attach the buoys to the passive gear you must use cords of submersible material or they must be weighted down so that they do not float to the surface. End marker buoys must be linked by cords to the furthest ends of the gear. End marker buoys You must use two end marker buoys so that each end of the gear can be determined at any time. You must rig end marker buoys with the specified number of lights, flags and reflectors depending on whether the buoy is in the western sector or eastern sector. Western sector: The half compass circle from south through west up to and including north. Eastern sector: The half compass circle from north through east up to and including south.

Catch Quota Trials: 2011 final report  Marine Management Organisation The final report for the 2011 scheme summarises how the practice is proving a successful, alternative method of managing fisheries. It shows that fishermen involved in the trials are discarding about 0.2% of the cod and sole they catch. In 2010, the average discard rates were 38% for North Sea cod trawlers and 28% for Western Channel sole beam trawlers. There were 3 vessels that took part in the South West trial and 12 in the North Sea. The boats were not permitted to discard any Western Channel sole or North Sea cod, including those below the minimum size. They had to land all of the fish of these species that they caught so they all counted against their quota. Once the quota was used up they had to stop fishing completely. On board monitoring, including CCTV cameras, checked whether they were following the rules. Catches of undersized fish in the trial were also low, suggesting that boats are fishing more selectively."

Catch Quota Trials: 2011 interim report  Marine Management Organisation The interim report shows that fishers involved in the 2011 trials are discarding less than 1% of the cod and sole they catch. This is far less than the 21% average across the EU for North Sea cod and the estimated 9% of sole discarded by English and Welsh vessels in the Western Channel. Catches of undersized fish in the trial are also low, suggesting that boats are fishing more selectively. Vessels in the South West and the North Sea are taking part in the trials as part of the UK’s initiative to tackle the problem of discarding, where dead fish are thrown away at sea if fishermen have no quota left for a particular species. Vessels in the trials are not permitted to discard any Western Channel sole or North Sea cod, including those below the minimum size, with all catches counting against quota. Once the quota for these stocks is used up the vessels must stop fishing for all species, whereas under current rules vessels can continue to fish but discard over-quota fish and risk over-exploitation of the stocks."

/government/publications/catch-quota-trials-western-haddock-2013-interim-report,"Interim report from the 2013 trial showing that discards are under the UK average for Western haddock. Catch Quota Trials: Western haddock 2013 interim report  Marine Management Organisation A trial has been carried out on a trawler fishing under a discard ban for Area VIIb-k haddock, which is caught amongst a diverse range of over 20 species in the south west mixed fishery. On-shore observers estimated that less than 0.01% incidental discards and less than 1% of the haddock catch was below the minimum landing size or damaged. The fishery in the area is fished by over 130 UK vessels, which discards about 62% of haddock because of quota restrictions. The results of the trial show the potential effect of a haddock as a choke species – a low quota species that, when the quota is gone, would lead vessels to stop fishing even if they still had quota for other species. The data suggests that the south west trawl fleet faces challenges in avoiding haddock catches, which could result in an early closure to this fishery when the quota is exhausted. The Cornish Fish Producers’ Organisation over-10-metre fleet’s 2012 landings data was used to estimate the overall level of discards of haddock and to describe the mixed nature of this fishery. All haddock catches continued to be fully documented until the end of 2013 and the total discards will be published in the final report."

The MMO is operating the catch quota trials on behalf of Defra as part of the UK’s initiative to tackle the problem of discarding fish – where fish are thrown away at sea if they are too small or there is no quota left for a particular species. The trials encourage fishermen to fish more selectively and land all of what they catch. Vessels taking part were awarded additional quota for North Sea cod and had an obligation to land and count all catches of cod against quota. They were also fitted with electronic monitoring systems with CCTV to observe and record fishing activity. Results for the 2013 trials show an overall estimated discard rate of North Sea cod of 0.03% (496kg) from a total sampled catch of 1452 tonnes."

Grade Composition and Selectivity of Haddock in ICES VII b-k  Marine Management Organisation Haddock is due to become subject to an EU landing obligation, where all catches will have to be landed and counted against quota. This means fishermen will no longer be able to discard to remain within quota limits and continue fishing. The study looks at landings of fish by size grade into English ports in the south west, which is considered to be indicative of a high level of discarding through quota restriction. It also includes the results of trials by fishermen of different trawl designs which have dramatically reduced overall haddock catches across all size ranges. The study suggests that the modifications to the trawl are able to reduce overall fishing mortality of juvenile and mature haddock whilst maintaining a profitable catch of other quota species, although further evidence is required to fully assess the commercial impact of such measures."
/government/publications/hm-naval-base-devonport,"Information on a marine licence application for maintenance dredging and disposing of dredged material  HM Naval Base Devonport  Marine Management Organisation On 8 November 2013 Westminster Dredging Company Limited applied for a marine licence to dredge the approaches to and berths and basins within HM Naval Base Devonport to maintain the navigational depths. The application also sought consent to dispose of the material to sea at the Rame Head South disposal site. On 26 November 2013 public notices were placed in local newspapers inviting representations about the application to be made before 7 January 2014. More than 80 representations were received by the Marine Management Organisation ( MMO ). These representations raised various issues including concerns over the potential impacts of the disposal on the Whitsand and Looe Bay Marine Conservation Zone ( MCZ ). Some also suggested alternative disposal locations. MMO consulted statutory bodies as part of assessing the application. These included: Natural England Environment Agency Devon and Severn Inshore Fisheries and Conservation Authority local planning authority An official written warning letter was sent on 30 April 2014 following a breach of marine licence conditions. Screening MMO considered the application in light of the representations received and the responses of the statutory bodies. MMO is satisfied that the potential environmental impacts associated with the activities were suitably addressed and issued a marine licence. Maintenance dredging protocol A maintenance dredging protocol baseline document has been agreed for the Tamar Estuary. This provides useful information on recent dredging activities there, and the effects arising from the dredging. Marine Conservation Zones On 21 November 2013, 27 MCZs were designated in UK waters to conserve the diversity of nationally rare, threatened and representative habitats and species. Marine conservation zones must be considered when deciding a marine licence application and MMO will consider the conservation objectives of each zone and any potential effects from proposed activities. MMO considered the potential effects of the proposed dredging and disposal activities on the nearby Tamar Estuary MCZ and Whitsand and Looe Bay MCZ . MMO concluded that the proposed activities are not capable of significantly affecting the protected features of either MCZ , or any ecological or geomorphological process on which the conservation of any protected feature of the MCZ is dependent. 2010 review of the Rame Head disposal site In 2010, MMO carried out a review of the Rame Head disposal site . This followed an earlier review by the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science in 2005. This review considered a large amount of published and unpublished evidence and consulted widely with various stakeholders. It concluded that the disposal activities are both legally and environmentally acceptable.

/government/news/annual-uk-fishing-industry-report-published-today,"The Marine Management Organisation (MMO) publishes its annual UK Sea Fisheries Statistics 2013 report today. Annual UK fishing industry report published today  Marine Management Organisation The report - available in full online - includes detailed figures on the UK fishing fleet, the number of fishermen, the quantity and value of landings, international trade and the state of key fishing stocks. The report highlights that in 2013: UK vessels landed 624,000 tonnes of sea fish (including shellfish) into the UK and abroad with a value of £718 million - a 1 per cent decrease in quantity and a 7 per cent decrease in value compared with 2012. Landings of demersal fish (such as haddock, cod and whiting) increased by 10 per cent between 2012 and 2013 to the highest level seen for over ten years. Landings of haddock - the highest caught demersal species – have risen by a third in two years to 40,000 tonnes. Pelagic (such as mackerel) and shellfish landings fell by 3 and 6 per cent respectively between 2012 and 2013. Pelagic fish accounted for the largest share in terms of landings (47 per cent) but the lowest share in value (25 per cent). Demersal fish accounted for the largest share in terms of value (38 per cent), slightly higher than shellfish (37 per cent). The Scottish and Northern Irish fleets caught mainly pelagic fish. Demersal fish account for the highest share of the English fleet’s catch and shellfish are predominately caught by the Welsh fleet. The UK fishing fleet fell from being the sixth to the seventh largest in the EU in terms of vessel numbers, with the second largest capacity and fourth largest power. Around 6,400 fishing vessels were registered with a total capacity of 197,000 GT and total power of 798,000 kW. 68 per cent of the quantity landed by the UK fleet was caught by vessels over 24 metres in length; 4 per cent of the total number of UK vessels. These vessels tend to catch lower value pelagic fish and their share of the value of the UK catch is 54 per cent. Around 12,150 fishermen were reported as active in the UK. Of these, around 1,800 were part-time. Scottish vessels accounted for 59 per cent of the quantity of landings by UK vessels while English vessels accounted for 31 per cent. Peterhead remained the port with the highest landings - 113,000 tonnes with a value of £112 million. This is more than double the levels seen in the second most active port, Lerwick. Brixham had the highest quantity of landings in England - 13,500 tonnes with a value of £24 million - closely followed by Plymouth with 11,600 tonnes at a value of £13.5 million. 739,000 tonnes of fish and processed fish were imported, 2 per cent lower than in 2012. Over the same period, exports decreased by 3 per cent to 453,000 tonnes. World figures for 2012 showed that China caught the largest amount of fish, 14.0 million tonnes. Indonesia had the second largest catch at 5.4 million tonnes, followed by the United States of America (5.1 million tonnes) and Peru (4.8 million tonnes). The full report, and more detailed supplementary tables, can be seen on the MMO website . MMO Acting Chief Executive, Andy Beattie, said: “We are pleased to see that demersal species have increased to the highest level seen for more than a decade. Landings of pelagic species have fallen slightly, but we continue to work closely with fishermen to help keep fisheries open for as long as possible, while ensuring stocks are maintained for the future. Notes to editors The Marine Management Organisation ( MMO ) regulates the seas around England, including the management of fisheries. The MMO has the difficult balancing task of ensuring that stocks are managed throughout the year to maximise fishing opportunities for the UK industry, whilst ensuring that stocks are not overfished and the UK government and taxpayer does not have to pay steep penalties. We are continually working with the fishing industry to improve day-to-day management with accurate catch limits and forecasts that secure longer fisheries, while safeguarding the welfare of fish stocks. The MMO , through the European Fisheries Fund ( EFF ), awards millions of pounds every year to the fishing industry and coastal communities.

/government/news/views-on-use-of-remaining-english-channel-cod-quota-sought,"The fishing industry is encouraged to have its say on how remaining 2014 quota for cod in area VIId should be used within England. Views on use of remaining English Channel cod quota sought  Marine Management Organisation The Marine Management Organisation ( MMO ) is seeking industry’s views on helping the English fishing fleet to maximise its uptake of quota for cod in the eastern English Channel (VIId). It has published the [InlineAttachment:1] in which it sets out a number of questions and options including the in-year reallocation of quota within the English fishing fleet. The document also explains work to seek extra quota for the UK from other EU member states. Cod in area VIId tends to be a winter fishery with highest landings from January to March and October to December each year. Due to the English under 10 metre pool nearing their quota limit for 2014 the fishery is currently at risk of closure to under 10 metre vessels, with the MMO accordingly reducing their catch limit for November to 250kg. The MMO believes the English under ten metre pool are the group most likely to catch the remaining quota, having caught 59 percent of the total landed by the English fleet so far. One of the proposals included in the consultation is to reallocate some cod quota to the English under 10 metre pool from Producer Organisations, who may not catch their allocation in full. Anyone with an opinion on the suggestions is invited to provide these to MMO Fisheries Management Team by the end of Friday 14 November 2014. Views can be provided by e-mail: martyn.youell@marinemanagement.org.uk, telephone: 0300 123 1032, or in writing to: Fisheries Management, MMO , Lancaster House, Hampshire Court, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE4 7YH The MMO is in the process of launching a consultation panel in early 2015 which will invite fishermen, policy makers to join them in finding solutions to maximising quota allocations."
/government/news/whale-watchers-keep-your-distance-or-risk-hampering-rescue-efforts-and-committing-wildlife-offence,"The Marine Management Organisation (MMO) is asking members of the public and wildlife tour operators to stay away from a pod of pilot whales off the coast of Essex. Whale watchers – keep your distance or risk hampering rescue efforts and committing wildlife offence  Marine Management Organisation The 30-strong group of whales was seen off the Essex coast on Tuesday and has since remained in the area, and not gone further out to sea and so are at risk of stranding. Any vessels navigating too close to the pod, such as recreational and wildlife watching boats, could be committing an offence and may be hampering urgent rescue efforts. Their proximity is likely to be causing further distress to the whales. MMO Wildlife Officer, Claire Bowers, said: “‘Unless you are directly involved in the rescue or monitoring of the pilot whales please stay away from them. Additional vessel traffic and noise could make the situation worse and increase the risk of the animals becoming stranded.” She added: “If you are operating in this area please ensure you take every action possible to avoid them. If you deliberately disturb these animals and do not make every effort to avoid them at a distance, you could also be at risk of committing an offence under EU and UK wildlife legislation.” The MMO is liaising with rescuers to ensure any vessels travelling too close to the pod are identified, and could then be investigated further."

/government/news/applications-sought-for-english-catch-quota-trials-for-2015,"The Marine Management Organisation (MMO) is seeking applicants for catch quota schemes in the North Sea and Western Waters in 2015.  Applications sought for English catch quota trials for 2015 Regulations, monitoring and enforcement Marine Management Organisation The fishing industry trials have taken place in England since 2010 and offer insight into how a ban on discarding fish may work in practice. In 2015 the scheme will continue to investigate and provide further evidence that will inform policy and implementation of a landing obligation, particularly for demersal species. A priority will be to document and monitor total catches across a range of species likely to be phased in under a landing obligation from 2016. Applications for the 2015 scheme Vessel owners who expect to fish in the North Sea or Western Waters from 1 January to 31 December 2015 can apply. Only English-registered vessels that are members of a producer organisation are eligible. Remote electronic monitoring (REM) equipment, including CCTV, will be used to monitor fishing operations and audit catch documentation. Vessels may also occasionally be required to carry MMO observers. Participating vessels will be allocated additional quota for the relevant species agreed in negotiations at December Council and between the EU and Norway and applicants are invited to bid for additional quota for the stocks they are interested in. Additional kilowatt days will also be available for applicants operating in the North Sea. Detailed information on the stocks that may be available is contained in the application packs. The pack also contains details of the project, contract and terms and conditions. Available stocks will be subject to the outcome of December Council negotiations but applications may be withdrawn if terms are not agreeable. The schemes will run from the start of 2015 for the full calendar year. About catch quota trials The catch quota trial scheme has demonstrated the effectiveness of catch quota management at reducing discards and encouraging more selective fishing behaviour. Results published on the scheme to date have highlighted the need for greater understanding of the implications of mixed species fisheries, particularly where one or more species appears to act as a ‘choke’, potentially calling an early halt to a fishery through quota exhaustion before the target species quota has been caught. Demersal landing obligation As part of the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy demersal fish species are due to become subject to a landing obligation from 2016 , where all catches will have to be landed and counted against quota. This means fishermen will no longer be able to discard to remain within quota limits and continue fishing."

/government/news/sourcing-quota-for-the-under-10-metre-and-non-sector-fleet,"The MMO has updated its guidance on quota leasing and on activities to source quota for the under 10 metre and non-sector fleet.  Sourcing quota for the under 10 metre and non-sector fleet Regulations, monitoring and enforcement Marine Management Organisation Those fishing against the 10 metres and under or non-sector pool quota can apply to lease extra quota from a producer organisation (PO) to supplement their catch limits or to keep fishing for a stock where the allocation has been reached. Following feedback from industry the MMO has added additional guidance to its website on the process they should follow when leasing extra quota. This includes encouraging people to contact the MMO to discuss their needs before taking out a lease. Such information may facilitate the MMO arranging quota swaps and gifts of quota from other EU Member States or Producer Organisations on behalf of wider groups within the pool. We can also provide an update on any ongoing negotiations. For example in 2014 the MMO has sourced additional haddock quota, bringing 49 tonnes into the English under 10 metre and non-sector pool which more than doubled the 30 tonne allocation originally available. This has enabled the MMO to keep the fishery open for the whole year and to increase the allocation in December. The MMO also sourced additional English Channel cod quota, in particular for area VIId. Following a consultation activity in November an additional 10 tonnes of English Channel cod quota (area VIId) was secured for the under 10 metre pool, with this being reallocated from an English Producer Organisation. The MMO used this to keep the fishery open with a catch limit of 400kg for the rest of 2014. The MMO aims to help the fishing industry maximise use of quotas available to them while ensuring that the limits set at EU level are not exceeded. It had reduced the cod catch limit for the under 10 metre fleet earlier in November due to the pool nearing their quota limit for 2014. The MMO would like to thank those who responded to the consultation, in particular Producer Organisations for their co-operation and trading with the Under 10 metre pool. This development has also contributed to the UK using a higher percentage of its cod quota for area VIId in 2014 than it did in 2013, with 90% so far this year against 56% in total in 2013."

/government/publications/catch-quota-trials-south-west-beam-trawl-2013-final-report,"Final report from the 2013 Southwest Beam Trawl Trials into Remote Electronic Monitoring (REM). Catch Quota Trials: South West Beam Trawl 2013 final report  Marine Management Organisation A trial was undertaken in 2013 with 9 vessels from the Southwest Beam Trawl fishery. Each vessel was fitted with Remote Electronic Monitoring ( REM ) and was required to operate under a discard ban for at least 2 catch quota stocks. All participants chose Dover Sole (Solea solea) [ICES Area VIIE] and anglerfish [ICES Area VII]. Four of the participants also chose megrim (Lepidorhombus whiffiagonis) as a third catch quota species. Additional quota for use in fully documented fisheries provided under the provisions of 2013 quota regulations was allocated to participants. The main aims of the trial were to: explore the implications of the landing obligation in this mixed demersal beam trawl fishery investigate plaice (Pleuronectes platessa) discard levels by using REM verified self-reported data continue to trial catch quota management of key demersal species Fishing effort was monitored for compliance with the requirement to retain and land all catches of catch quota species from a 5% audit of REM data and CCTV footage. Overall, the 9 vessels in the trial fished in a similar pattern to the rest of the West Channel beam trawl fleet and can therefore be considered to provide a representative sample. The results show low levels of discards of catch quota species, which is comparative to previous trials. Although not chosen as a catch quota species, plaice discards were also monitored. There was a clear spatial pattern in plaice discards with the highest levels around the 12 nautical mile limit and decreasing further offshore. The results show that for many trips a landing obligation for plaice would have a low impact as very few plaice are discarded. The high levels of discards in the inshore grounds would impact a small number of vessels significantly however, in the absence of improved selectivity or avoidance behaviour. Overall, REM has been shown to be a cost-effective method of corroborating data reported by the fishing industry. There was a high correlation between onshore observer and skipper estimates."

Grants towards replacement VMS terminals for over 15m vessels Regulations, monitoring and enforcement Marine Management Organisation For some years now fishing vessels of 15 metres and over have been operating a satellite-based vessel monitoring system to comply with EU Regulations. That requirement is now extended to vessels of 12m overall length and over by Council Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 404/2011 The introduction of VMS to these smaller vessels is now almost complete. The MMO is therefore now in a position to accept grant aid applications for replacement terminals for vessels over 15m. Process Grant aid up to a maximum of £2,000 may be available for the new device for English fishing vessels. Once the MMO receives application forms and clarifies these meet the eligibility criteria it will contact the supplier, AST, who will in turn arrange for a time and date for installation. After AST install the device they will then invoice the MMO for payment. Application forms and further guidance is available from the MMO website . Grant aid is time-limited and early application is therefore strongly recommended. In order to apply for grant aid, completed applications must be with the MMO by 20 February 2015. Failure to apply is likely to result in vessel owners paying at least £2,400 for the new device. For more information contact Ray Hedley on 0300 123 1032. Reminder on grant for e-logbook software upgrade The MMO wrote to the fishing industry on 14 January about grant aid to upgrade the separate e-logbook software systems. The deadline for this was 6 February. Anyone who has not yet applied should contact the MMO as soon as possible."

/government/news/future-of-dredging-at-her-majestys-naval-base-devonport,"The MMO has provided an update on proposed changes to dredging and disposal activities on behalf of HMNB Devonport. Future of dredging at Her Majesty’s Naval Base Devonport Marine licences Marine Management Organisation The Marine Management Organisation ( MMO ) has provided an update on proposed changes to dredging and disposal activities on behalf of HMNB Devonport. The MMO has held negotiations with representatives of the ‘Stop Dumping in Whitsand Bay’ campaign group which brought a claim for judicial review challenging the MMO ’s decision to grant a marine licence for dredging activity at HMNB Devonport and disposal of material at the Rame Head South disposal site. Having reviewed the matter the MMO actively sought to resolve these proceedings by reaching agreement with the campaign group on an order quashing the licence. This order was made by the High Court on Monday 2 February 2015. While the MMO believes its decision about the existing licence in relation to the dredging and disposal activities was substantially correct and in accordance with relevant environmental law, it acknowledges that its records in this case do not adequately record or explain its decision making. The MMO has recently been involved in talks with the Ministry of Defence ( MOD ) about the future of important dredging activity at HMNB Devonport and disposal of material at the Rame Head South site. The MOD has made an application for limited plough dredging at critical berths. This application, which will be published on the MMO website in due course, does not include the disposal of material at sea due to the nature of the proposed activity. The quashing of the existing marine licence by the High Court will not affect future applications for disposal activity at the Rame Head South site. These will still be considered on a case by case basis. The MMO is also undertaking a strategic review of disposal sites around the coast of England to provide additional information to assist future decision making on marine licensing applications. This review will look at the current status of each site, sensitivities and forthcoming designations, and the process for identifying and using disposal sites. As part of this review the MMO will involve relevant stakeholders and look to assess the best available evidence, including any new evidence in relation to the designation of new Marine Conservation Zones and European Marine Sites. The MOD will continue to work with the MMO and the Centre for Environment, Fisheries & Aquaculture Science ( Cefas ) to explore the future of dredging operations at the site and the destination of material removed from its approaches. Further information Dredging at HMNB Devonport was recognised as an important activity for the operation of the facility in the order of HHJ Collins granting permission for the judicial review challenge to proceed which was made on the 8 October 2014. Further information about the HMNB Devonport case is available in the MMO ’s selected cases section ."

/government/publications/marine-conservation-zones-mczs-and-marine-licensing,"Marine Management Organisation duties in relation to Marine Conservation Zones (MCZ) and marine licensing Marine Conservation Zones (MCZs) and marine licensing  Marine Management Organisation Section 126 of the Marine and Coastal Access Act ( MCAA ) (2009) places specific duties on the MMO relating to Marine Conservation Zones ( MCZs ) and marine licence decision making. This is because s.126 applies where; (a) a public authority has the function of determining an application (whenever made) for authorisation of the doing of an act, and (b) the act is capable of affecting (other than insignificantly) - (i) the protected features of an MCZ; (ii) any ecological or geomorphological process on which the conservation of any protected feature of an MCZ is (wholly or in part) dependent. In determining how to apply s.126 in undertaking its marine licensing function, the MMO is introducing a new MCZ assessment process that will be integrated into existing marine licence decision making procedures. This will apply to all new marine licence applications with immediate effect and is relevant to MCZs proposed by Defra (together with their proposed features and proposed conservation objectives) until the point of designation. From the point of designation it is the designated MCZs (together with features and conservation objectives) which will be relevant. MCZ sites and features identified as possible candidates for designation in future tranches will be NOT be subject to the MCZ assessment process. However, the MMO will consider the evidence base associated with those sites in its decision making.

Reducing unused licences (latent capacity) in the English 10 metre and under fishing sector Defra are seeking views on the current levels of latent capacity as part of their work to make the English inshore fleet more sustainable. Latent capacity means the number of licences issued to allow fishing for quota species, which are not used. It also describes licences issued and used to catch 300kg quota species or less a year. The term is also used for rights (entitlements) to catch shellfish, which are not currently used. Defra would also like your views on how to reduce latent capacity to help to solve any problems. ** This consultation closed on 31 March 2015. ** Marine Conservation Zones Defra has also launched a consultation on the second tranche of sites to be considered as marine conservation zones (MCZs). 23 sites are proposed for designation as MCZs with additional features for conservation proposed for 10 existing sites. This closes on 24 April 2015. Marine Strategy Framework Directive Defra is also consulting on its plans to implement the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) in the UK . Other proposals listed on this page, Marine Conservation Zones and the demersal landing obligation, aim to contribute towards achieving Good Environmental Status in our seas under the MSFD. This closes on 24 April 2015. Demersal landing obligation The demersal landing obligation is a ban on the discarding of fish. This prevents fish being thrown back into the sea after being caught, except when subject to specific exemptions . In particular, Defra is seeking views on five key areas of implementation including: phasing in of the landing obligation quota management access to exemptions catch management monitoring and enforcement The consultation results will inform the Government’s policy position and negotiations with other Member States in the regional groups. These regional groups operate across our shared fisheries to ensure that the rules being applied are appropriate, fair and effective for all fishermen. The regional groups are due to submit demersal Discard Plans by June 2015 to the European Commission. ** This consultation closed on 31 March 2015. ** Marine licensing: changing how some cases are decided The consultation covers proposals for a change to marine licensing as operated by the Marine Management Organisation (MMO) on behalf of the Secretary of State. The proposal is to introduce a mechanism whereby the Secretary of State can recover certain, complex marine licence decisions for her own determination. The proposals would allow local planning authorities and Inshore Fisheries and Conservation Authorities (IFCA) to seek an independent inquiry into certain complex cases. The final decision would be taken by ministers who are directly accountable to Parliament. The change is expected to only apply to a limited number of cases that meet specified criteria. The draft criteria are: The Secretary of State may recover a marine licence application for her own determination where she is satisfied that the application falls into either of the following categories: 1) The application is one where the MMO has received a formal representation from an LPA or IFCA affected by the proposal seeking determination by the Secretary of State and: the activity falls into band 3 of the Marine Licensing (Application Fees) Regulations 2014 (as amended) – i.e. the more complex cases such as construction projects over £1m or projects requiring an environmental impact assessment or an appropriate assessment under the Habitats Regulations, or dredge disposal operations the activity is taking place wholly or partly within the 6 nautical mile limit the potential effects of the decision are significant and could benefit from examination in public or 2) The application includes a novel activity that raises wider issues of national significance not covered by the UK Marine Policy Statement or other relevant marine planning documents, and could benefit from examination in public. This consultation applies to English waters and the offshore areas of Wales and Northern Ireland where the Secretary of State is the licensing authority. ** This consultation closed on 25 February 2015. **"

/government/publications/changes-to-fishing-vessel-licensing-arrangements,Guidance for fishermen on the rules for fishing vessel licences. Fishing vessel licensing arrangements Vessel licensing Marine Management Organisation You can contact your local MMO office from which your licence is being administered for more information.
/government/news/changes-to-fishing-vessel-licensing-arrangements,"On 26 March 2015 the government announced its response to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) consultation on “Simplifying fishing vessel licensing in England”. Changes to fishing vessel licensing arrangements  Marine Management Organisation With effect from 1 June 2015 the Marine Management Organisation (MMO) will apply the following rules: remove the expiry date of fishing vessel licences remove the expiry date of entitlements remove capacity penalties remove the mismatch rule No more minor mismatches will be permitted. Where financial commitments have been made prior to this notice the MMO will be looking at cases individually where evidence can be provided. Other fisheries administration in the UK may adopt similar or different rules while licence entitlements will continue to be transferable between administrations. Where rules differ the rules of the administration receiving a licence entitlement will apply. The changes yet to be implemented include moving to a single licence category for over 10 metre vessels. The following rules still apply in England which may vary from other Fisheries administrations: no entitlements obtained from under 8 metre vessels can be used in aggregation to licence a 10 metre and under vessel engine power limits licensed by aggregation for under 8 metre vessels will remain at 100kw and for 10 metre and under vessels at 150kw. Single licence transfers over these limits will continue to be permitted, unless the entitlements to be used have been created through aggregation outside of English administration after 24 February 2015. More information on fishing vessel licensing arrangements can be found on the MMO website."
/government/news/changes-to-demersal-trawl-selectivity-measures-in-the-celtic-sea,"In 2012 the European Commission introduced the requirement for vessels using bottom trawls and seines to use Square Meshed Panels (SMP) to improve selectivity and protect juvenile fish in the Celtic Sea. Changes to demersal trawl selectivity measures in the Celtic Sea  Marine Management Organisation On 29 May 2015 the requirements will change and all vessels in the Celtic Sea using bottom trawls and seines of mesh size range between 70-119mm must insert a 120mm SMP. The rear edge of the panel must be no further than 9 metres from the codline. There are permitted derogations: vessels may use a derogated device or combination of gear and device which has been assessed by the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF) as having the same or higher selectivity for cod, haddock and whiting; or vessels fishing in the area east of 8° West of the Celtic Sea and whose catch comprises at least 55% whiting may use a SMP of at least 100mm if the codend mesh size is 100mm or greater (TR1) A vessel is only permitted to use a derogated gear if it has been issued with an authorisation prior to going to sea. English registered UK vessels can apply for an authorisation by contacting the Marine Management Organisation (MMO) fishing vessel licensing team on 0191 376 2598 or email fishingvessellicensing@marinemanagement.org.uk . For the purposes of the regulation the Celtic Sea is defined as ICES divisions VIIf, VIIg and the part of VIIj that lies north of latitude 50° N and east of 11° W. Further details on the requirements can be found in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 737/2012 as amended by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 741/2015 and please contact your local MMO office if you have any queries."

/government/publications/north-sea-cod-catch-quota-trials-final-report-2014,"This report provides the results of the North Sea cod fully documented fishery scheme for 2014.  North Sea Cod Catch Quota Trials: Final Report 2014  Marine Management Organisation A trial was undertaken in 2014 with 16 vessels in the North Sea. Each vessel was fitted with Remote Electronic Monitoring ( REM ) and was required to operate under a discard ban for North Sea (Area IV) cod. Additional quota for use in fully documented fisheries provided for under the 2014 quota regulations was allocated to participants. The main aims of the trial were to: further investigate the potential of catch quota management to reduce discard levels with particular focus on how mixed fisheries will be affected provide evidence and experience from the scheme in advance of the demersal landing obligation being phased in from 2016; enhance our data collection to improve fisheries science and advice investigate the potential for likely ‘choke’ species in North sea mixed demersal fisheries Fishing operations were monitored for compliance with the requirement to retain and land all catches of cod by means of a 10% audit of REM data and CCTV footage. In addition, the distribution of size-grades of landed cod was analysed as a means of providing an indication of possible high-grading amongst participant and non-participant vessels. The audit results show very low levels of discards of cod (less than 1%). This indicates that the vessels are compliant with the landing obligation, and is comparative with previous trials. Grading analysis showed a significantly higher percentage of smaller grades of cod being landed by participant vessels in comparison non-participant vessels. Analysis was also undertaken on saithe, haddock and hake discards for two vessels chosen at random. The results showed high levels of discarding, particularly for saithe and hake. The discard data was generated from CCTV footage by converting length measurements to weight. Whilst this study does not aim to derive fleet-level discard estimates, the efficacy of using REM /CCTV as a data collection tool continues to show potential. Overall, REM has been shown to be an effective method of corrobating data reported by the fishing industry and a cost-effective tool for monitoring the landing obligation."

/guidance/do-i-need-a-fishing-vessel-licence,"The licence sets out where you can fish, what you are not allowed to fish and the limits for the stocks you are allowed to fish and land. Fishing vessel licence requirements  Marine Management Organisation Introduction Fishing vessels registered in the UK must have a licence to fish for sea fish that will be sold. The purpose of the licensing system is to restrict the size of the UK fleet and control UK fishing opportunities to stay within the quotas under the European Union ( EU ) Common Fisheries Policy. There are different types of licence, depending on the length of the vessel, the species fished and the waters the vessel will operate in. This guide helps you to decide if you need a licence and the type of licence that you need. It also explains that you will have to register your vessel and obtain a licence entitlement before you can apply for a vessel licence. Do you need a fishing vessel licence? If your vessel is registered in the UK you must have a licence to fish for sea fish that will be sold. The licence system ensures that the UK does not exceed its yearly quotas under the EU Common Fisheries Policy. If you fish for sea fish without a licence and sell your catch, you may be prosecuted. You may have to pay a fine of up to £50,000 for each offence and forfeit your gear and fish. No new licences are being issued so you will have to obtain a licence entitlement before you can apply for a licence. Vessels that require a licence There are some exceptions, but generally you need a licence to be able to sell any of your catch. This is the case even if you are just selling what you don’t want for yourself to friends or a fishmonger. There are different types of licence, depending on where you are going to fish. You will need: a domestic licence if you are only going to fish in UK and EU waters an external licence if you are going to fish outside UK and EU waters Vessels that don’t require a licence You don’t need a licence if: you only fish for salmon or migratory trout - contact the Environment Agency for more information your vessel is 10 metres or less in length and you’re only going to fish for common eels you only fish within the 12 nautical mile limits around Jersey, Guernsey or the Isle of Man - contact the relevant authority for advice about their licensing requirements you only use your vessel for carrying anglers who are fishing for pleasure Transfer of vessels and/or licences from outside the MMO Before entering into financial commitments, you are strongly advised to contact your local MMO office when considering buying a vessel or licence entitlement from outside the MMO area. The following list is not exhaustive but may indicate issues you are advised to check with us: that you have sufficient FQAs to enter the English non-sector (mainly for over ten metre vessels); a licence entitlement that was previously used to licence a vessel in the non-sector outside England will not automatically be permitted to enter the English non-sector that your vessel will be licensed with sufficient Days at Sea eligibility (for over ten metre vessels); to enable your proposed fishing gear to be used in the areas you wish to be active that your vessel will be licensed with a full ten metre and under licence and that the licence (or any of its donor licences) have not been capped previously (this applies to vessels of ten metre and under in length) If you have purchased a vessel or entitlement without checking with us first we may be unable to licence your vessel the way you have intended it to. Different types of fishing licence The type of licence you need depends on the size of your vessel and the category your fishing activities fall into. Vessels are divided into two groups for licensing purposes - those that are: 10 metres and under in overall length over 10 metres in overall length The three licence categories are: Category A Category B Category C There are also special licences for certain types of fishing and for some minor fisheries. These are issued for: minor pelagic fisheries - Atlanto-Scandian herring, Firth of Clyde herring, Mourne herring and Thames and Blackwater Herring blue whiting albacore tuna handline mackerel mussel seed deep sea species Read more about fishing vessel licence types . For fishing outside UK and EU waters, you’ll need an external waters licence in addition to your domestic licence. Help with deciding which licence to get Your local Marine Management Organisation ( MMO ) office can advise you which licence you need. You can find contact details for your local MMO office on the MMO website . How to obtain a vessel licence The purpose of the vessel licensing system is to control UK fishing opportunities. To restrict the size of the UK fishing fleet, no new fishing vessel licences are issued. This means that if you want to license a vessel for the first time you have to arrange for an existing licence ‘entitlement’ to be transferred to you. A licence entitlement is created when a licence is no longer attached to an active fishing vessel. This may occur when a vessel: is sold with or without its licence sinks is scrapped is otherwise deregistered If the boat you purchase comes with a licence attached to it, an entitlement will be created from that licence which you can use to licence the vessel in your name. But if it doesn’t have a licence attached to it, you need to acquire an entitlement from somewhere else. Available licence entitlements are advertised from time to time in trade newspapers. Local fishing vessel agents may also be aware of suitable licences available for transfer. The MMO doesn’t get involved in commercial transactions. Although they can advise you on suitable entitlements, you are responsible for making sure that entitlements you buy meet your requirements. Before you can be issued with a fishing vessel licence your vessel must be registered with the UK Ship Register - Registry of Shipping and Seamen ( RSS ). Apply for a vessel licence The steps you need to follow to apply for a vessel licence are: apply for a certificate of registry from the RSS apply to transfer the licence entitlement into your name using form AFL7 apply for the licence using form AFL2, after the local Fishery Office returns the completed form AFL7 confirming you as the entitlement holder When you send in form AFL2 you must also send the completed form AFL7 and a valid certificate of registry. If you’re combining (‘aggregating’) two or more entitlements, you usually have to pay a ‘capacity penalty’ when you license your vessel. If you’re just using a single licence entitlement, you don’t have to pay a capacity penalty. See more information on applying for a fishing vessel licence . Registering a vessel Before you can get a licence for your vessel you must register it with the UK Ship Register - RSS . There are two types of registration: full registration - where you have to prove ownership by producing documents of sale covering the three previous years (or a builder’s certificate in the case of a new vessel) simple registration - where you can provide a receipted invoice instead of formal bills of sale Documents required to register a vessel You need to complete a British ship form and submit it with the appropriate supporting documentation and the fee to the UK Ship Register. You can do this online or by post. The documents you need to register your vessel depend on whether you’re applying for full or simple registration. For full registration you’ll need forms: MSF4740 - Application to register a British Ship MSF4728 - Declaration of Eligibility MSF4705 - Title Document, a Bill(s) of Sale covering the last three years and/or builders certificates MSF4743 - Builders Certificate For simple registration you need: form MSF4740 - Application to register a Fishing Vessel form MSF4728 - Declaration of Eligibility an original receipted invoice or Bill of Sale to the person who wishes to register the vessel You can find all forms for registering your vessel on the Maritime and Coastguard Agency ( MCA ) website. For both forms of registration you also need to send: copy of Certificate of Incorporation (if the owner is a body corporate) Safety Certificate (for vessels over 15 metres) International Tonnage Certificate (ITC69) if the vessel is over 15 metres Seafish Certificate registration fee Fishing vessel survey A fishing vessel has to be surveyed before you can register it on the UK Ship Register. You can find out about fishing vessel surveys on the MCA website. Choose the port of choice Your vessel will be registered to a port of choice. You can find a complete list of ports on the MCA website. Fees and costs for registering a vessel The level of fees and costs depends on the type of registration you choose. You can find details of the fees and costs of registration on the MCA website.

/government/collections/fishing-offences-penalties-and-inspections,"Details of how vessels are inspected and fisheries resources are protected in the UK. Fishing offences: Penalties and inspections Regulations, monitoring and enforcement Marine Management Organisation The Marine Management Organisation ( MMO ) enforces UK and European laws that protect fisheries resources. MMO inspects fishing vessels at sea and in port. If you don’t comply with the law, MMO may take action in line with the MMO ’s Compliance and Enforcement Strategy . Inshore fisheries management Under the Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009, ten inshore fisheries and conservation authorities (IFCAs) have replaced sea fisheries committees (SFCs). Each IFCA manages an IFC district that covers part of the English coast that goes out to six nautical miles and its inland boundaries align with those of its constituent local authorities. IFCAs also manage sea fisheries resources in estuaries that fall within their districts. The 10 IFCAs are: Cornwall Devon and Severn Eastern Isles of Scilly Kent and Essex North Eastern North Western Northumberland Southern Sussex IFCAs have powers in regards to: boarding and inspecting vessels entering and inspecting premises, dwellings and vehicles inspecting documents IFCAs have powers to make byelaws to manage sea fisheries resources within their districts and for wider environmental purposes - eg the protection of species and habitats from fishing activity. Each IFCA governing committee is made up of: one seat each for representatives from the Marine Management Organisation ( MMO ), the Environment Agency and Natural England elected representatives of county and unitary local authorities in the district members who understand the needs and opinions of the local fishing community, and who have knowledge of marine environmental matters Fishing regulations The Blue Book is a consolidated version of UK and EU fisheries legislation. The MMO try to maintain The Blue Book with up-to-date legislation but cannot guarantee that it is up to date at all times. Inspections  Financial administrative penalties MMO issues financial administrative penalties as an alternative to criminal prosecution. A penalty must be paid within 28 days to prevent prosecution in court. If a penalty is not paid within 28 days, the matter will go to court. You have the right to have your offence dealt with in court so not paying the penalty is not an offence. A written warning or a financial administrative penalty may not always be issued for a first or subsequent offence if MMO believes court proceedings are more suitable. Repeat offending may result in increased penalties or an automatic referral for prosecution. Fishing licence points system European law classifies breaches of fisheries rules into the following serious infringement categories: does not hold a valid licence has no registered flag state fails to use compliant fishing gear breaks conservation and management rules does not properly record and report catches fishes in a closed area fishes for a stock which is subject to a moratorium or for which fishing is prohibited falsifies or conceals its markings, identity or registration conceals, tampers with or disposes of evidence relating to an investigation obstructs an inspection or observation takes on board undersized fish works with fishing vessels identified as having engaged in Illegal, Unreported or MMO will apply points to the fishing licence if a licence holder of an English-registered vessel is convicted of a serious infringement in a UK court. Offences committed in other member states will also be referred to the vessel’s relevant fisheries administration for the application of points."

/government/news/changes-to-marine-licensing-processes-from-6-april,"A number of changes come into effect from 6 April 2014 affecting licence applications for developments at sea. Changes to marine licensing processes from 6 April Marine licences Marine Management Organisation The Marine Management Organisation (MMO) is responsible for regulating depositing or removal of substances or objects from the seabed or elsewhere in tidal waters under the Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009. Since MMO vested in 2010 it has continued to develop the licensing process, resulting in a quicker turnaround and less regulatory burden for applicants. MMO has been involving businesses and industry representatives in the development of the policies and regulations where possible, and has been working to ensure they are aware of developments before they are implemented. These changes include: extending the fast track system for certain licence applications a revised fees structure for marine licence applications new licensing requirements for navigational dredging activities Fast-track system A fast-track system may be used to process applications for some activities that have been identified as being low risk and quick to process – fewer than 3.5 hours. These activities still need a marine licence, but the consultation stage is replaced with marine licence conditions as long as specific eligibility criteria are met. The range of projects included in this scheme was extended from 6 April and now covers: burials at sea some maintenance activities deposit and removal of marker buoys and marker posts minor removals non-navigational dredging More information on the fast track system. Fees and charges MMO has listened to small businesses who were concerned about the disproportionate burden of the cost of an application to the capital cost of their activity. A revised fees structure for marine licence applications is being introduced as part of the Marine Licensing (Application Fees) Regulations 2014 , which extends MMO’s powers under the Marine and Coastal Access 2009. MMO’s charging structure has been revised into clear bands of fixed ceiling costs for smaller standardised marine activities, and fixed hourly charges for more complex and time consuming activities. The new fees allow MMO to recover 96% of costs and subsidise the remaining 4% to limit increases in fees for smaller projects. See fees and charges for further information. Navigational dredging If you want to carry out navigational dredging activities in English seas and the tidal areas of rivers from 6 April 2014, you may be required to apply in advance for consent from MMO. Navigational dredging was made a licensable activity by the government as part of the Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009, though when the act came into effect in 2011 it allowed a period of transition during which low-risk dredging operations did not require a marine licence. In preparation of the changes MMO has been working with industry representatives and our advisors to improve the application process and reduce the financial and administrative burden as far as possible. An accelerated application process is being put in place, on which a decision may be made within 20 working days. Further information on dredging ."

It seeks to provide scientists and others responsible for making decisions on the management of fisheries with the information they need. One significant area of the DCF is the setting out of the scientific data that are needed as inputs into the annual assessments of fish stocks. Article 25(2) of the newly reformed common fisheries policy (sets out the key principles for data collection: accuracy reliability and timeliness avoidance of duplication through improved coordination safe storage in database systems improved availability of data compliance with laws on personal data protection access for the European Commission, enabling it to check the availability and quality of data and the methodology used to collect them. These principles will be central to a Commission proposal for a revised Data Collection Framework regulation that is currently being prepared. The Data Collection Framework is co-funded by the European Commission under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) which the fund for the EU ’s maritime and fisheries policies for 2014-2020. It is one of the five European Structural and Investment (ESI) Funds which complement each other and seek to promote a growth and job based recovery in Europe. Background Pending the introduction of the revised regulation, the DCF will be underpinned by the existing regulation: EC Regulation 199/2008. This sets out the broad requirements relating to the: collection, management and use of data in the framework of multi-national programmes the data management process use of data collected in the framework of the Common Fisheries Policy support for scientific advice. Regulation Under the regulations, member states are required to compile a wide range of biological and economic data as specified in the Commission Implementing Decision ( EU ) 2016/1251 of 12 July 2016 which sets out the requirements for 2017-19. The requirements include: biological data on stocks caught by Union commercial fisheries and by recreational fisheries; data to assess the impact of Union fisheries on the marine ecosystem; detailed data on the capacity and activity of Union fishing; social and economic data on fisheries ; social, economic and environmental data on aquaculture; In order to meet the DCF requirements, each member state is required to set out the programme of work they will undertake. The rules on the format and content of work plans are set out in Commission Implementing Decision ( EU ) 2016/1701 of 19 August 2016. The UK’s National Correspondent for the Data Collection Framework is Matt Elliott UK work programme Under the EMFF, each Member States has submitted an Operational Programme which outlines activities including data collection that will be co-funded.

The EU Directorate General for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries is responsible for steering, in close relationship with stakeholders at regional and European level, the development and implementation of the Integrated Maritime Policy and to manage the Common Fisheries Policy. This is done with a view to promote the sustainable development of maritime activities as well as the sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources within and beyond Community waters. As such, the directorate’s functions include management of the Data Collection Framework. Marine data sources The Marine Environmental Data and Information Network ( MEDIN ) , a partnership of public and private sector organisations working to provide harmonised stewardship and access to marine data and information. In doing so, it seeks to facilitate improved management of the seas and round the UK. MEDIN has established four marine data archive centres: the British Oceanographic Data Centre the Data Archive for Seabed Species Habitats the United Kingdom Hydrographic Office British Geological Survey MEDIN has also identified a further two candidate data archive centres, one for fisheries and one for marine meterology. Procedures EC regulation 1078/2008 lays down the detailed rules regarding the expenditure met by EU member states to fulfil the Data Collection Framework ( DCF ) requirements under the current programme. EU funding of 50% of the total amount incurred is available to help member states carry out the work. However, to be eligible for a Community financial contribution, the expenditure must meet a strict set of criteria. In order to assess whether or not each member states’ programme of work complies with its obligations, and can therefore be regarded as valid by the Commission, the programmes are reviewed by the scientists involved in fisheries work (through the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee of Fisheries forum ( STECF ). Once the final work programmes have been agreed, taking in any amendments required, each year a final formal Commission Decision is voted on by member states to confirm the amount of funds available for each member state for the planned work. Member states then receive an advance payment of half of the allotted funds for that year. After the end of each year, member states must submit: a technical report providing details of their national programme undertaken in the previous year (see Technical Reports ) a financial report detailing the total actual costs of the work carried out and the balance of funds due to each member state is paid out. As central co-ordinating body for the UK for this work, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs ( Defra ) receives the payments made to the UK. Transfers are made of amounts to [gri-Food and Biosciences Institute ( AFBI ) and to Marine Scotland treasury accounts to match the anticipated receipts incorporated into their financial programmes. Defra funds the overall costs of Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science ( Cefas ) work through their memorandum of understanding. The remaining payment is therefore used to offset the overall payments made to cover Cefas ’ total costs.

/government/publications/falmouth-habour--2,"Information on construction works, capital dredge and maerl mitigation scheme in Falmouth Harbour Falmouth Harbour  Marine Management Organisation Maerl relocation trial Falmouth Harbour Commissioners ( FHC ) carried out a trial to inform the original proposal and specifically provide information on the susceptibility of maerl and associated communities to disturbance by dredging. Information on the original proposal can be found on the Marine Management Organisation ( MMO ) public register The programme of works for the trial included: benthic (bottom of the sea) sampling of proposed trial sites before dredging dredge and re-laying of dead and live maerl communities – 5 sites of dead maerl and 1 site to have a covering of live maerl on the dead maerl) benthic sampling of proposed trial sites for up to 6 months after it has been re-layed turbidity monitoring at the surface during dredging – turbidity is a measure of the degree to which the water loses its transparency due to the presence of suspended particulates The final sampling event to provide evidence for this trial was carried out between 30 July and 1 August 2013. Data from the trial was analysed by scientists from Plymouth University and the final report on the trial was submitted to MMO on 30 January 2014. Further documents relating to the maerl relocation trial application are available via the MMO public register application number MLA/2012/00100. This includes a technical overview of the project. The trial report was sent by MMO to the Independent Scientific Advisory Panel ( ISAP ). The ISAP was set up in 2012 to provide the MMO with independent scientific advice on: the scientific robustness of the trial methodology whether the methodology is fit to meet the overall purpose of the trial whether the methodology will provide credible conclusions The ISAP only provided comments on the trial itself and not the wider impacts of the proposed project. The ISAP reviewed the scientific basis of the report, and submitted comments and recommendations to MMO on 7 March 2014. The ISAP concluded that the trial adequately demonstrated that the method used in removing and replacing the top 30cm of maerl habitat was technically feasible. The MMO provided the ISAP ’s comments to Falmouth Harbour Commissioners ( FHC ) with a covering letter on 24 March 2014. The maerl trial report can be used by FHC as part of the evidence to support any future application for the Falmouth Harbour proposal, but FHC must consider the comments of the ISAP if they decide to use this evidence. The letter also highlights the need for the application to reflect how the trial relates to a full scale dredge. The MMO ’s letter of 24 March also referenced the MMO evironmental statement from November 2013 and an addendum from March 2014, both of which are also available on this page. Next steps MMO ’s letter to FHC on 24 March 2014 also identified the next steps with regards to: updating the appropriate assessment updating the environmental impact assessment submitting new marine licence applications to MMO Original application Falmouth Harbour Commissioners and Falmouth Docks & Engineering Company applied for 3 licences to carry out harbour construction works, a dredge disposal and a maerl mitigation project. The proposed development is located in the Fal and Helford Special Area of Conservation ( SAC ). During consultation, Natural England advised that the proposal would have a likely significant effect on the designated features of the European site. Therefore, under the requirements of the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010, an appropriate assessment was required to assess the proposed development’s impact on the conservation objectives of the European site. Appropriate assessment ( AA ) conclusion In light of the evidence provided to support the AA , we could not conclude that there would be no adverse effect on the integrity of the Fal and Helford SAC . Further information regarding the decion made by the MMO can be found in the letter to applicants dated 27 January 2011 and the Appropriate Assessement by the lead competent authority (the MMO ) both of which are available on this page.

/guidance/understand-fisheries-catch-limits-and-closed-fishing-areas,"How catch limits are set and how to get involved in setting them. This includes current catch limits and closed fishing areas. Understand fisheries catch limits and closed fishing areas  Marine Management Organisation What are catch limits? It is your responsibility to know your catch limits. Check the annexe to your vessel licence for detailed information about what you can and cannot catch. Any breach of the terms set out is a criminal offence. Catch limits are measured in tonnes (t) or kilograms (kg). They are the maximum live weight that may be caught and retained on board, landed or transhipped, unless otherwise stated. You calculate the live weight by multiplying landed weight by the suitable conversion factor . Get involved in setting catch limits The Marine Management Organisation ( MMO ) wants to involve fishermen in managing the quota for 10-metres-and-under and non-sector vessels. Your comments and suggestions about setting catch limits can help to make sure that decisions are made taking into account the real situation at local level. Please send relevant information to catchlimits@marinemanagement.org.uk before the 15th of the month. MMO cannot respond to individual emails, but you may contact you for more information. Email fmc@marinemanagement.org.uk if you want MMO to visit a fishermen’s association or organisation to discuss quota issues. Sector catch limits Your producer organisation ( PO ) will tell you your catch limits. Your fishing vessel licence will list the stocks that you cannot keep on board or land. Check with your PO if you have any queries about catch limits. Over 10 metre non-sector and 10 metres and under pool catch limits Your catch limits are in your vessel licence annexe and can be varied through the year. Your fishing vessel licence annex will also list the stocks that you cannot keep on board or land. Current catch limits are detailed for 10 metres and under and over 10 non-sector pools Closed fishing areas It is illegal to fish with restricted fishing gear in a closed fishing area for the specified period of time that it is closed. If you don’t comply with the closure, you may be investigated and this may lead to a fine. Fishing gears Restricted gears are: demersal trawls and seines beam trawls fixed nets – gill, entangling and trammel long lines Gears that are not restricted are: scallop dredges pots pelagic gears drift nets purse seines jiggers that target herring, mackerel and horse mackerel Real time closures A real time closure ( RTC ) helps to reduce: disruption to spawning grounds the number of juvenile fish caught the amount of fish discarded MMO manages a system of closures in English waters to help manage cod effort in the Eastern Channel (Area VIId) and the North Sea (Area IV). Marine Scotland manages closures in Scottish waters. RTCs apply to all UK vessels 10 metres and over that use the restricted gears. Vessels under 10 metres are asked to comply voluntarily. You may also be interested in reading more information on closed fishing areas in English waters The EU runs a scheme in all EU waters that applies to all EU fishing vessels. EU juvenile real time closures In September 2009, the European Community and Norway agreed to implement a RTC scheme in the North Sea and Skagerrak for the protection of juvenile cod, haddock, whiting and saithe. The scheme is independent of our current real time closure scheme in place for cod. In August 2010, detailed rules for the implementation of real time closures were put into practice by [InlineAttachment:1]. All closures instigated by this scheme must be adhered to by all EU member state vessels. Read the [InlineAttachment:2] to see explanations of each of the four types of real time closure including: trigger levels sample sizes duration of closure size of closure. The details of the scheme are as follows: Closures shall only be determined by live sampling at sea by an authorised inspector. Where it is estimated that 200 kg of any mixture of cod, haddock, whiting and saithe are present in the haul, a sample shall be taken. A representative sample (start, middle and end of haul) of at least 200 kg shall be weighed and measured. Fish below the following sizes shall be regarded as juveniles Juvenile closure trigger levels - if 10 per cent of the sample (by weight) are juveniles, then a closure trigger is activated. Or if the total quantity of cod in the sample exceeds 75 per cent, then the trigger level shall be 7.5 per cent juveniles (by weight). The closed area shall be 50 square nautical miles and closed to fishing for 21 days. The area will automatically reopen at midnight (UTC) when the period has expired. Under the EU juvenile real time closures scheme there is no limit to the number of closures at any one time within the North Sea. Permitted gears within EU juvenile real time closures Pelagic trawls Purse seines Drift nets Jiggers targeting herring, mackerel, horse mackerel Pots Scallop dredges Gill nets There are no current juvenile closures. Historical cod catch rates MMO uses the cod catch rates (kilograms an hour) from the previous catch year and vessel monitoring system data to identify areas where the numbers of cod are the highest. MMO can close up to 9 areas each month. An offshore (outside of 12 nautical miles from shore) area will be closed for the entire month, and inshore (within 12 nautical miles from the shore) area will be closed for 14 days. Live samples taken at sea If a sample is at or above a specific level (trigger level), an area may be closed. Offshore areas will be closed for 21 days and inshore areas for 14 days. North Sea and Eastern Channel When What the closure protects Trigger level 1 January to 30 April Spawning mature cod (longer than 50cm) 10 mature cod 1 May to 31 December Cod and to prevent discards 80 cod (all sizes) North Sea and Skagerrak juveniles A representative sample from the start, middle and end of a haul will be weighed and measured if the haul contains 200kg of any mixture of cod, haddock, whiting or saithe. When What the closure protects Trigger level Entire year Juvenile species of cod (less than 35cm), haddock (less than 30cm), whiting (less than 27cm) and saithe (less than 35cm) 10% of the sample, or 7.5% of the sample if more than 75% of the sample is cod Fish below the following sizes shall be regarded as juveniles: cod 35cm haddock 30cm whiting 27cm saithe 35cm Trigger levels will usually be assessed during an inspection at sea.

/government/news/bluefin-tuna-spotted-off-south-west-coast,"Sightings of bluefin tuna off the English South West coast have been reported to the Marine Management Organisation (MMO).  Bluefin tuna spotted off South West coast  Marine Management Organisation On Monday a vessel escorting tourists around Mounts Bay, Penzance reported what it thought to be a group of bluefin tuna. Fishermen in the area have also spotted the shoal. The Atlantic bluefin tuna is a large migratory fish found in the western and eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea. The UK has no quota for bluefin tuna and UK fishing vessels must not target the species. If bluefin tuna are caught accidentally they must be returned to the sea. If this is not possible then the fish may be landed but must not be sold. Nick Wright, South West Marine Area Manager said: “Sightings such as these are unusual although we have never had any reports of illegal activity. We will continue to monitor the situation and sightings can be reported to the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas which is an inter-governmental fishery organisation responsible for the conservation of tunas and tuna-like species in the Atlantic Ocean and its adjacent seas. The important thing to note is that the species should not be targeted as there is no UK quota.”"

Fishing industry in 2014 statistics published  Marine Management Organisation It includes details on the UK fleet, the number of fishermen, the quantity and value of UK landings, international trade, worldwide fishing and the state of key stocks. The report highlights that in 2014: the quantity and value of sea fish (which include shellfish) landed by UK vessels has increased by 21 per cent and 16 per cent respectively on 2013 UK vessels landed 756 thousand tonnes of sea fish into the UK and abroad with a value of £861 million the large increase in landings was primarily driven by a 76 per cent increase in mackerel landings, due to a sharp rise in quota for this species pelagic fish such as mackerel and herring accounted for the largest share in terms of UK fleet landings (58 per cent) but the lowest share in value (32 per cent) the Scottish and Northern Irish fleets caught mainly pelagic fish. Demersal fish account for the highest share of the English fleet’s catch and shellfish are predominately caught by the Welsh fleet the UK fishing fleet remained seventh largest in the EU in terms of vessel numbers, with the second largest capacity and fourth largest engine power seventy four per cent of the quantity landed by the UK fleet was caught by vessels over 24 metres in length which accounted for 4 per cent of the total number of UK vessels. These vessels tend to catch lower value pelagic fish and their share of the value of the UK catch is 58 per cent around 11,800 fishermen were reported as active in the UK. Around 2,100 were part-time scottish vessels accounted for 64 per cent of the quantity of landings by the UK fleet while English vessels accounted for 27 per cent Peterhead remained the port with the highest landings – 159 thousand tonnes with a value of £145 million Brixham had the highest quantity of landings in England – 11,600 tonnes with a value of £21 million, closely followed by Newlyn with 11,300 tonnes but with the higher value of £22 million exports of fish and processed fish increased by 10 per cent to 499 thousand tonnes compared with 2013. Over the same period, 721 thousand tonnes were imported, a fall of 3 per cent world figures for 2013 showed that China caught the largest amount of fish, 14.1 million tonnes. Peru had the second largest catch at 5.8 million tonnes The full report , and more detailed supplementary tables, can be accessed on the UK Sea Fisheries Statistics page.

/guidance/apply-for-a-harbour-order,"How to apply for a harbour order to either create new harbour powers or to change the existing powers of a harbour authority. Apply for a harbour order Marine licences Harbour orders Marine Marine Management Organisation Harbour revision orders (HROs) are used to change the legislation governing the management of a harbour. Harbour empowerment orders (HEOs) are mainly concerned with building new harbours and or creating harbour authorities responsible for improving, maintaining and managing them. Harbour orders that have purely administrative effect are commonly called ‘non-works orders’. Those which authorise a development are commonly called ‘works orders’. If you are seeking a works order, a marine licence may also be required. The processes for works orders and marine licences are different and the role of the Marine Management Organisation ( MMO ) is different in each, but MMO will seek to process the applications for the harbour order and the marine licence together. The complexity of the proposal, the nature and numbers of objections and parliamentary timescales will all affect the time taken to process an application for a harbour order. MMO may stop your application if: you do not comply with the suitable procedural requirements there are outstanding objections you withdraw the application Before you apply You should discuss requirements and procedures with MMO and consult relevant authorities and interested people locally before making an application. Contact the Marine Licensing Team on 0300 123 1032 or email harbourorders@marinemangement.org.uk . Notify MMO that you intend to apply You must notify MMO in writing of your intention to submit an application if the proposed order would directly or indirectly authorise a project. Project means starting works or other installations or schemes, and other interventions in the natural surroundings and landscape including the extraction of mineral resources. Assess environmental impact MMO will screen the application to decide whether an environmental impact assessment ( EIA ) is necessary and what it should cover. MMO will also give reasons for the decision. The EIA required for a harbour order is required by a different set of regulations to an EIA for a marine licence, but the work carried out is the same. MMO will usually choose to defer its marine licence EIA decision to its harbour order decision. Draft an order You can request an informal review of the draft order before making an application to identify any fundamental issues. It is also recommended that you take independent legal advice. Formal application Please discuss MMO ’s specific requirements for your application with the case officer before you make an application for a harbour order. Applications should be sent by email to harbourorders@marinemanagement.org.uk or posted to: Harbour Orders Marine Management Organisation Lancaster House Hampshire Court Newcastle upon Tyne NE4 7YH Fees You must pay the suitable fees when you formally apply. The fees are: £2,000 if the sole purpose of the order is to amend the borrowing powers of an existing authority £4,000 for any other order that would not empower an authority to carry out works £6,000 for an order which expressly empowers an authority to carry out works where an EIA is not required £10,000 for an order which expressly empowers an authority to undertake works where an EIA is required Documents to provide when you apply Submit an accompanying statement with your application. This may be the only opportunity to put your case for the order, so it is important that you set out fully why the order is necessary, how it meets with relevant policy, and how the requirements of the Harbours Act 1964 have been met. You must also include. 6 copies of the draft order and any annexed documents and maps the fee copies of the environmental statement as specified by MMO Advertise and consult the application You must advertise the application and MMO will usually also write directly to those we consider to have an interest in the proposal. In some instances, MMO will also direct you to provide copies of the application to specific bodies. You must provide original copies of the notices to MMO once they have appeared. If the order would authorise the compulsory purchase of land or affect a footpath or bridleway, there are extra requirements for giving notice. These include: serving notice on every owner, lessee, tenant and occupier affected by the compulsory purchase serving notice on every local authority for the area in which the public right of way is situated displaying the notice in a prominent position at each end of the part of the public right of way affected by the order From the date the advert first appears, there are 42 days for objections and representations to be made. If you have an objection to a proposed harbour order, you must state the grounds for your objections. If there are any objections that cannot be resolved then a public inquiry may be held. Change your draft order After you have submitted a formal application, you may propose changes to the draft order. This is most commonly done to resolve objections or concerns. MMO will consider the significance of the changes and decide whether another advertisement or consultation is needed. MMO will not accept a change that introduces the compulsory purchase of land, which was not described in your original application, unless all interested parties give their approval. Where MMO proposes to make an order with modifications that substantially affect the character of the order, everyone likely to be concerned will be informed and allowed reasonable time for comment. Public inquiry An inquiry may be held where there are outstanding objections to an order. An inspector is appointed and each inquiry is managed to suit the particular case. You, the applicant, have to meet all costs and make the necessary practical arrangements. Costs can vary considerably and they are not a part of the application fee. You must pay MMO to cover the cost of the inquiry after the inspector’s report has been received. You are usually required to give notice of the inquiry in the same papers where you advertised the original application not fewer than 6 weeks in advance. If there are related applications, such as planning and licensing applications, MMO may deal with them all together at a single inquiry. After the inquiry, the inspector’s report recommends actions for MMO to consider when making its final decision. Final decision MMO ’s decision on your application for a harbour order will be sent to you and interested people. It is also published on the harbour orders public register . An order will usually be made at the time the decision letter is issued. As the applicant you must publish notice of the fact that the order has been made in the same publications where earlier notices appeared. A copy of the order must be served on anyone on whom notice of the application was previously served. Following an order being approved, it is laid before Parliament for a period of 40 days. It will automatically become law unless there is an objection from either house. The date the order will come into force must be at least 21 days after it is laid before Parliament. Appeal There is no right of appeal against refusal to make a harbour order or its terms. The order may, however, be challenged within 6 weeks from the date it becomes operative by application to the High Court.

Consultees should note that whilst the current application stipulates that disposal of dredged material will be to Rame Head South the final disposal site will not be agreed until closer to the start of works. The MMO is currently working with all applicants who require disposal licences including the MoD to look into alternative disposal sites in the longer term. The MMO will consult on any amendments made to the disposal site within the application. Further information All marine licence applications are available from the marine licensing public register.

/government/news/under-10m-sampling-project,"The European Commission has raised concerns about the MMO’s monitoring and control of fishing activity by under 10m vessels in England  Under 10m sampling project  Marine Management Organisation As a result, officials from the MMO visited the EC on 12 March 2015 to put forward a series of proposals to address the Commission’s concerns. These were accepted by the EC and the MMO is now enacting them. As such, the MMO has committed to improving the data held on landings by under 10m vessels through a programme of work comprising three principal elements: Stage 1 - a statistical and data collection exercise to identify gaps in data coverage and the accuracy of existing data for the under 10m fleet; Stage 2 - an enhanced targeted programme of catch checking/weighing at the point of landing, first sale or take-over of the catch. Stage 3 - evaluation of the findings in a) and b) above with a view to determining in consultation with industry what further measures may be required. The MMO has contracted CEFAS to carry out stage 1 of this work. CEFAS scientists have already started working with fishermen at ports around England to collect data on vessel landings, with particular emphasis on ports considered to be at greater risk of having gaps in data and from the most sensitive fisheries for sole and cod. Where possible, this information will be combined with pre-existing CEFAS observer data from a number fishing trips conducted across England. When CEFAS complete their sampling work with industry, they will provide the MMO with data that is anonymised and aggregated. The MMO will not receive any data on individual vessels from CEFAS. The purpose of this work is to try to understand if there are shortfalls in existing data and assess the accuracy of the data we currently receive for the under 10m fleet. This work will take place over coming months with a view to reporting its findings in March 2016. It will provide the MMO with an independent and scientifically robust assessment. The MMO has already explained the purpose of this sampling project to the Fisheries Stakeholder Panel, which includes representation from the National Under Ten Fishermen’s Association (NUTFA). We will use the panel as a communication channel to keep industry representatives fully engaged and informed as the work proceeds. CEFAS will provide their findings to the panel before submitting their final report to the MMO. The MMO is very grateful to those fishermen who have been assisting CEFAS so far, notably at ports in the South-east of England. Please help us by encouraging other fishermen to do likewise when or if they are approached by CEFAS staff in their ports."

/government/publications/catch-quota-trials-western-haddock-final-report-2014,"This report provides the results of the Southwest haddock fully documented fishery scheme for 2014. Catch Quota Trials: Western Haddock Final Report 2014  Marine Management Organisation The trial was undertaken in 2014 with a single twin rigged otter trawler fishing in West Channel ICES area VIIe. The vessel was fitted with Remote Electronic Monitoring (REM) with CCTV and was required to operate under a discard ban for the following species: Area VIIb-k haddock, Area VII megrim, and Area VII anglerfish. Additional quota for use in fully documented fisheries provided for under the 2014 quota regulations was allocated to the participant. The main aims of the trial were to: further investigate the potential for REM to provide an independent verification of skipper’s records test the selectivity of different types of gear and avoidance measures for reducing juvenile and mature haddock test the ability of the vessel to work within a discard-free fishery for haddock, megrim and anglerfish enhance our understanding of the impact of working within a discard-free fishery on fishing behaviour and economics The audit of CCTV footage found that REM was able to monitor the full fishing operation to verify that the discard prohibition was complied with. A high correlation was found between the skipper’s catch estimates and REM observer estimates for all species studied. Data confidence was good for haddock as the system had been set up to study that species. The skipper tested a variety of gear modifications with the aim of reducing haddock catches. The most selective gear for reducing juvenile and mature haddock bycatch was a reduced cover trawl with two square mesh panels. The vessel also modified fishing behaviour to reduce haddock catch such as through reduced fishing at night. The adoption of both selectivity and changes in fishing behaviour enabled the fishing vessel to operate with the discard-free fishery for haddock, megrim and anglerfish for the full year. In particular, the measures taken led to a vast reduction in the catch of juvenile haddock. However, this vessel has greater access to haddock quota than others using ports in the Southwest. This appears to have changed in 2015, with the vessel finding it more difficult to operate a discard-free fishery within reduced quota limits. Details of this will be given in the 2015 report."

MMO opens €243 million European Maritime Fisheries Fund in England  Marine Management Organisation The scheme brings much needed benefits to the fisheries and aquaculture sectors as well as coastal communities. Key areas of focus for the funding are to help the fishing industry to adapt to the reformed Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) as well as supporting the competitiveness of the sector. Applications for funding are initially sought for: support with elements of CFP reform, improving health and safety on vessels, enhancing the quality or value of catch, investing in port and harbour infrastructure such as ports/auction halls/shelters, the processing of seafood and aquaculture products and general investments in aquaculture. The MMO are also commencing the process of selecting Fisheries Local Action Groups (FLAGs) for England to help fisheries communities adapt to the reformed CFP and to support sustainable economic growth. The scheme will open for other measures later this year but these initial areas cover over €33m of EMFF funding which is being made available. Commenting on the opening of the EMFF scheme, CEO John Tuckett said: “The MMO are delighted to be able to open the EMFF scheme for applications in England. The scheme provides significant opportunities for hard working fishermen, associated businesses and the wider marine sector to gain much needed funding to assist and benefit their important work and activities. The MMO have made significant efforts to ensure support is in place for scheme users including a new e-application system, redesigned website and dedicated customer helplines. I therefore urge everyone to visit our website, look at the funds and funding types available and submit an EMFF application at the earliest opportunity.” Access the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund ( EMFF ) pages: EMFF : before you apply EMFF : apply for funding EMFF : successful applicants EMFF : UK Managing Authority (UKMA) EMFF : Fisheries Local Action Groups (FLAGs)"
/government/collections/catch-quota-trials-reports,"Catch quota management is an alternative system of managing fish quotas that counts all catches of fish at sea against a vessel’s quota. Catch Quota Trials Regulations, monitoring and enforcement Marine Management Organisation Those taking part are able to get extra quota for some fish species as long as they don’t discard any of these – regardless of size. Fish below the minimum legal size must be landed but not sold and will still count against the quota. Fishers decide how to avoid unwanted catches, either by moving area or using bigger meshes in their nets. If fishers run out of quota for a species they have to stop fishing. The extra quota cannot be more than 30% of a vessel’s usual catch and no more than 75% of the amount they may have thrown away before. If a vessel sticks to these rules, they will get some extra quota, and those fishing in the North Sea are less restricted in the number of days they can spend fishing. Some participants are also provided with a degree of flexibility from rigid technical rules about fishing nets, which are also being reviewed as part of the Common Fisheries Policy reform process. The trails will be run in accordance with the rules agreed in December Council 2015, which will be adopted in the quota regulations 2016. These rules enable vessels participating in fully documented fisheries, including the use of CCTV coverage, to secure additional quota for certain stocks.

MMO hosts UK EMFF launch event attended by Marine and Fisheries Minister  Marine Management Organisation The event was attended by George Eustice MP (the Marine and Fisheries Minister), Defra, representatives of the UK Devolved Administrations, representatives of the European Commission and key representatives of the fisheries and wider marine sector. MMO Chairman Sir Bill Callaghan and Chief Executive John Tuckett told the delegates how the EMFF scheme had been developed based on feedback from industry, experience of operating the European Fisheries Fund (EFF) and in partnership with delivery partners including Defra and the Devolved Administrations. The Commission informed delegates that they were pleased with the development of the EMFF scheme in the UK. They also expressed the confidence they have in both the MMO and the Devolved Administrations ability to deliver the EMFF programme. This was supported by the MMOs experience in managing European funding schemes for the UK. The Minister spoke about the importance of EMFF to the fisheries sector and the much needed help it would bring to support fishermen with legislative changes such as Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) reform. An open discussion was then held between all attendees as to how industry, the MMO and the Devolved Administrations could continue to work together on the new scheme. Further enhancements to the EMFF and the funding opportunities that the new scheme presents to the UK were also discussed. Marine and Fisheries Minister, George Eustice said: “Today’s EMFF launch event has given me the chance to speak first hand with representatives of the fisheries, aquaculture, and processing sectors. I have heard just how important the 243 million euro fund will be to help them to adapt to the discard ban and create growth across the entire seafood sector. “The fund can support fishermen and the wider seafood industry in every part of the UK and I would urge people to visit the MMO website to learn more about the scheme and the support available.”"

MMO announces the next phase of the EMFF scheme in England  Marine Management Organisation New FLAGs The EMFF scheme in England provides a budget of €6.4m (£4.9m) to fund up to six FLAGs to support community-led local development in fisheries communities. The key focus of successful EMFF FLAGs is to support their area to adapt to the reformed Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) and to maximise economic growth opportunities within the fisheries and aquaculture sectors. To be successfully selected as a FLAG, the first step is for groups to submit an Expression of Interest. Those interested in becoming a FLAG are encouraged to visit the MMO website for further information and to submit an expression of interest before the deadline of 4 March 2016. An event for potential FLAGs is being held in London on 24 February 2016, details and registration information is available on the MMO website. Potential new FLAGs who are successful at the Expression of Interest Stage, will then be invited to develop a Local Development Strategy which further details they key issues and needs in the local area. Michelle Willis (MMO, Chief Finance Officer) said: “This is a very exciting time for the EMFF scheme in England. We are looking forward to working with new potential FLAGs to select those who can deliver the greatest benefits to local fisheries and aquaculture communities.” The first EMFF Assessment Panel for applications £100,000 and over. The MMO will be holding a panel to consider EMFF applications for projects costing £100,000 and over. The panel will meet week commencing 6 June 2016. The applications to be assessed in the panel must be submitted to MMO by 29 March 2016. Any project applications costing £100,000 and over received after this date will not be assessed in the June panel. Applications of less than £100,000 will continue to be assessed on a regular basis and are not affected by these deadlines. Further panels to consider large projects with deadlines for submitting applications will be announced in due course. Michelle also commented: “Setting the date for our first Panel is a key step in the ongoing management of this new scheme. We have received a lot of interest in the EMFF scheme over the last two weeks which is really encouraging. I would urge applicants to continue to use the guidance on our website before submitting applications and supporting documentation. Taking the time to check your application really helps speed up the process and get you a decision as quickly as possible.”"

/government/publications/marine-licensing-fees,"Fees information for the different marine licences and associated work. Marine licensing: fees Marine licences Marine Management Organisation Fees are payable for different types of project based on the time it takes the Marine Management Organisation ( MMO ) and the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science to process the application. An MMO case manager will notify you of the suitable fee band for your application. This can be changed if new information about your project makes a different band more suitable. If your application is moved to a different band, MMO will seek your agreement before doing any further work. Where an application is to carry out more than 1 licensable activity and they fall in different fee bands, the higher fee band is payable. For example, an application to dredge material and dispose of it at sea includes a band 3 project (dredging) and a band 2 project (disposal – if fewer than 1 million cubic metres), so the fees applied to the application will be band 3. From 1 October 2014 you will also be charged a fee for any new licence variation or post-consent work, even if the licence was issued before this date.

Cattewater disposal of dredged material  Marine Management Organisation On 10 September 2015 Cattewater Harbour Commissioners, submitted an application to the Marine Management Organisation (MMO) for a marine licence to undertake disposal of dredged material from capital navigational maintenance dredging in Cattewater Harbour. The application is for disposal of the dredged material at the Rame Head South disposal site taking place over a three week period.

/guidance/supply-aquariums-and-zoos-with-marine-species,"Guide to the rules and regulations to know before performing sea-fishing activities to supply aquariums and zoos. Supply aquariums and zoos with marine species Regulations, monitoring and enforcement Marine Management Organisation Catching marine species Aquariums, zoos and similar enterprises in the UK source wild-caught marine species for display, research and feeding purposes. You must have a fishing vessel licence issued by one of the UK or Crown dependency fisheries administrations to fish for profit for sea fish (including shellfish) from a UK vessel. It is an offence to fish for profit from a vessel without a licence. If you don’t have a fishing vessel licence you will need to charter a licensed fishing vessel. The Marine Management Organisation ( MMO ) issues licences for vessels registered and administered in England. Foreign vessels must have a fishing licence issued by another European member state. Any UK boat measuring 10 metres or under which does not have an engine to power the boat, does not need to have a licence and may sell their catch. Quota, effort and minimum landing sizes You will have to comply with quota, effort and minimum landing size regulations unless you have a relevant dispensation (exemption) . These rules apply even if the vessel is chartered by an organisation on whose behalf the species are collected. Scientific research MMO may issue a dispensation to a vessel from certain UK and EU laws for scientific research. Collecting species for supply to aquariums for display purposes will not normally fulfill the criteria for this. MMO will only consider requests when evidence proves the dispensation is necessary and appropriate for scientific investigation. Protected species Some marine species are protected by international and national wildlife laws from intentional or deliberate disturbance, taking, harm and killing, and in some cases possession or sale. The laws can apply to activities from a vessel and from the shore. MMO will not issue a dispensation for any protected species. Protected sites A European marine site ( EMS ) is any created to protected species and habitats, or birds. You must check whether your activity is restricted in the areas before you collect any specimens. Some coastal areas are designated as sites of special scientific interest ( SSSI ) and you must check with Natural England before collecting specimens if any restrictions apply. See the complete list of SSSIs . Shore harvesting A fishing licence is not needed to collect marine species from the shore if you are not using a fishing vessel. You may require a dispensation from an inshore fisheries and conservation authority ( IFCA ) from their byelaws, which regulate shore and vessel activities within their district. A byelaw may require a permit to carry out certain activities and apply restrictions to, for example: minimum sizes of marine species type and quantity of fishing gear access such as closed periods or areas Check with the relevant IFCA before collecting specimens. Buying marine species It is against the law to buy fish from a vessel that doesn’t have a UK or EU fishing vessel licence unless the vessel does not require a vessel licence. A buyer must be registered to buy first-sale fish directly from a licensed fishing vessel if it is for display or animal feed purposes. If you are buying fish second-sale from a registered merchant or fish seller, you don’t need to register. First-sale fish purchases must be notified to MMO in a sales note within 24 hours of the sale if submitted electronically, or 48 hours in paper format. You can register for free on the Registered Buyers and Sellers Scheme. An individual or company does not have to register as a buyer of first-sale fish or submit sales notes to purchase shore-caught fish.

Update on MMO’s strategic review of disposal sites  Marine Management Organisation The Marine Management Organisation (MMO) is nearing the conclusion of a review of all disposal sites in England. The MMO commissioned Cefas to undertake a high level, review of all disposal sites around the country. This review is a desk- based review focussing on marine disposal sites in English waters. It will make recommendations on how the MMO manage disposal activities. The MMO licenses disposal at sea under the Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009. Such activity is usually licensed at a number of disposal sites that have been in use for longer than 10 years. Given recent events such as the designation of Marine Conservation Zones (MCZs), European Marine Sites (EMSs), and the development of marine plans, the MMO is keen to understand the current sensitivities around all disposal sites and to review their current management strategy. It is expected that the review will be completed in the next two months and the MMO intend to communicate the findings of the review and how they are taking any recommendations forward on it’s website."

/government/publications/harwich-haven-authority,"Request for designation of a new dredged material disposal site. Harwich Haven Authority  Marine Management Organisation The MMO has concluded its assessment on the characterisation of the new Harwich Haven disposal site report and addendum. Harwich Haven Authority ( HHA ) is seeking to have a new dredged material disposal site designated. HHA carries out maintenance dredging to maintain access to navigation channels within its area of jurisdiction. Some of the dredged material is used in beneficial reuse schemes with the remainder disposed of at a licensed offshore disposal ground called Inner Gabbard located about 30km east of Harwich. Inner Gabbard is one of the furthest offshore disposal sites in the UK. A disposal site closer to shore would help reduce carbon dioxide emissions, steaming time and fuel use as: HHA ’s maintenance dredging and disposal operations are the largest part of their carbon dioxide output and fuel use the costs of dredging and disposal activities have increased in recent years due to various factors including fuel prices and exchange rates Background HHA has submitted a site characterisation report to Marine Management Organisation ( MMO ), which is available on the MMO marine licensing public register. Click on ‘Eastern’ area and use ‘Ctrl F’ to search for application number MLP/2014/00006. MMO has completed an initial review and consultation on the site characterisation report. The consultation closed on Wednesday 5 March 2014. MMO has requested further information from HHA to fully assess the potential impacts of the creation of the disposal site. In particular, further information is required on: local shellfisheries local aggregate extraction sites fish spawning grounds in the vicinity of the proposed disposal site the conservation objectives of the Outer Thames Estuary Special Protection Area (SPA) The letter MMO issued to HHA on 23 April 2014 and a copy of all consultation comments are available on this page. In March 2015 HHA submitted an Addendum to the original Report, which aims to provide the further information requested. In May 2015 the MMO carried out consultation on the Addendum. The MMO will publish the findings of this consultation when it has been completed. The submitted information is available on the marine licensing public register and this in the Documents Section of this page. HHA held consultation meetings in Harwich and Felixstowe on 5 and 6 February, primarily for local fishing interests but were open to all. A copy of the presentation slides used at the meetings is available on this page. How HHA chose the location for the proposed new disposal site HHA carried out a site selection exercise to identify the most suitable location for a new dredged material disposal site. The exercise used publically available data and information that identified sensitive environmental features and marine activities within a defined study area. Areas were given a sensitivity score or value, using informed judgement and information available from the literature, to reflect each feature’s vulnerability to disposal activities. This exercise highlighted an area of apparent low sensitivity to the west of the current Inner Gabbard disposal site. The most appropriate place for a new disposal site was deemed to be at the western extremity of this area of low sensitivity – that is closest to Harwich Haven. The proposed new disposal site is approximately 9km closer to the coast than the Inner Gabbard site. HHA has calculated that using this site rather than the Inner Gabbard site would reduce their fuel use by 14% and significantly reduce both costs and carbon emissions. How MMO makes its decision An environmental impact assessment ( EIA ) is not required for a site to be designated under the Marine Works ( EIA ) Regulations 2007 (as amended). However, MMO will carry out a process similar to that for a statutory EIA in order to decide whether or not to designate (create) the new disposal site.

They make the marine licensing process more efficient and cost effective in specific cases which the MMO considers to be low risk. If you intend to rely on exemption(s) you must make sure that you meet the relevant qualifying criteria and conditions. You might also need to notify the MMO about your activities. Enforcement action might be taken if it is later determined that the activity, or the circumstances in which it was carried out, are not consistent with the terms of the relevant exemption. Exempted activities Together the exemptions orders 2013 and 2011 list 34 activities which may be exempt from requiring a marine licence (“a licence”). These activities are split into three categories: exemptions for which no notification is required exemption which require notification to be given to the MMO exemptions which require approval from the MMO In addition there is an exemption in Section 75 of the Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009 for certain dredging activities, or the disposal of dredged material carried out by or on behalf of a harbour authority.

/government/news/successful-emff-flags-in-england-proceed-to-next-stage-of-selection,"Six Fisheries Local Action Groups (FLAGs) move to next stage of selection under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) Successful EMFF FLAGs in England proceed to next stage of selection  Marine Management Organisation The Marine Management Organisation ( MMO ) is delighted to announce the six Fisheries Local Action Groups ( FLAGs ) who will move forward to the next stage of selection under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund ( EMFF ). Thirteen Stage 1 applications from potential EMFF FLAGs were considered by the MMO , Defra and a representative of the rural development programme for England. The final decision was made at an MMO panel meeting on 27 April 2016. As part of the process, FLAG strategies were considered covering areas such as sustainability, growth and assistance with legislative changes as a result of Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) reform. The successful FLAGs were announced as: Cornwall, Dorset and East Devon, Hastings, Holderness, North of Tyne and North Thames. These FLAGs will now prepare for the next stage of the selection process later this year by producing Local Development Strategies outlining the needs of their local area. Michelle Willis ( MMO , Chief Finance Officer) who chaired the selection panel said: “Selection of the six FLAGs to proceed to the next stage was incredibly difficult because all potential FLAGs presented compelling strategies and the overall quality of applications was high. However, after much discussion and consideration it is great to be able to identify the six FLAGs who will proceed to the next stage of the process. “I am also personally pleased with the spread of FLAG experience we have been able to achieve, three of the FLAGs were previously European Fisheries Fund (EFF) FLAGs whilst three are new to the process, but have a wealth of experience in delivering programmes. “I look forward to seeing the strategies of the FLAGs further develop and I would like to thank all of the FLAGs who took part in the process for their considerable work and effort. During this next stage we will be looking to allocate the €6.4 million budget, based on the strength of strategies received”. Over the next three weeks the MMO will feature blogs from three of the successful FLAGs and these will be available on the MMO marine developments blog ."
/guidance/european-maritime-and-fisheries-fund-emff-fisheries-local-action-groups-flags,"European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) and Community-Led Local Development (CLLD). European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF): Fisheries Local Action Groups (FLAGs) Funding Marine Management Organisation The application deadline for Fisheries Local Action Groups (FLAGs) has now closed Background Fisheries areas across the EU are facing significant challenges. The continuous decline in income and employment in the fishing sector has underlined the need for innovative responses that are both sustainable and inclusive. Community-Led Local Development (CLLD) is a tool that enables local fisheries communities to address these challenges at a grass-roots level using the knowledge of local stakeholders to tackle local issues. The European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) in England will fund up to 6 Fisheries Local Action Groups (FLAGs) to deliver fisheries focused CLLD in England. This will be done through a Local Development Strategy (LDS) designed by each of the FLAGs. Key focuses of FLAGs under EMFF will be supporting fishing communities to adapt to the reformed Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) and supporting sustainable economic growth. The budget available is €6.4m which represents over 9% of the total EMFF Budget available in England. To focus the benefits of this approach FLAG LDS will be delivered over a maximum of 3 years. The process for selecting FLAGs in England opened on 1 February 2016, Stage 1 is now complete and Stage 2 to select Local Development Strategies is underway. Stage 2 – Selection of Local Development Strategies will look at key areas including: The extent which the local area will be effected by the reformed CFP and how an LDS will mitigate these issues How sustainable economic growth can be developed and enhanced at the local level Ways in which the EMFF funding can be used to leverage other investment into the area The capacity and capability of the group to deliver the LDS Selected Groups will be invited to form a FLAG and will be given an allocation of funding based on their strategy. Selected FLAGs are expected to launch in late 2016 or early 2017."

Exploring the potential of using Office for National Statistics (ONS) data for Marine Planning (MMO 1075)  Marine Management Organisation Overall, within the data already collected by ONS , it appears that many of MMO ’s needs could be met. However, there is a level of geographical imprecision and the need for apportionment of certain sectoral information to be considered. Although the output is to support primarily the marine planning process it should be suitable for use by other MMO functions that require an insight on the socio-economic profile of marine and coastal areas. The report was published on 31 July 2014."
/guidance/european-maritime-and-fisheries-fund-emff-before-you-apply,"Information about the available funding from the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) scheme European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF): before you apply Funding Marine Management Organisation The EMFF scheme in England opened for applications on 18 January 2016 with the remaining Articles being opened on 23 May 2016. The €92.1m available budget will provide funding for: assisting the fisheries sectors with the implementation of the reformed CFP including the Landing Obligation improving health and safety on fishing vessels improving the added value or quality of fish caught including use of unwanted catches investments in fishing ports, landing sites, auction halls and shelters processing of fishery and aquaculture products investments in aquaculture Fisheries Local Action Groups (FLAG) You can apply for funds to support the fishing and maritime sectors under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF). EMFF follows the European Fisheries Fund (EFF) and will run until 2020 or until all available money has been allocated. The Marine Management Organisation (MMO) will accept applications for EMFF funding from early 2016. About the EMFF The EMFF is a European funding scheme which will support fisheries, inland waters, aquaculture and maritime sectors. The fund provides support for sustainable development within the fishing and aquaculture sectors and conservation of the marine environment, alongside growth and jobs in coastal communities. The purpose of the scheme is to provide European Member States with a financial support mechanism to the fisheries, inland waters, aquaculture and maritime sectors. The scheme will help reach economic, environmental and social goals and will enable European Member States to: help fishermen in the transition to sustainable fishing support coastal communities in diversifying their economies finance projects that create new jobs and improve quality of life along European coasts make it easier for applicants to access financing The UK has €243 million (around £190 million) of the programme which is split between England (€92.1 million), Scotland (€107.7 million) Northern Ireland (€23.5 million) and Wales (€19.7 million). EMFF priorities The aims of the EMFF is structured around 6 priorities, each with several specific objectives. All of these are supported by specific measures. Promoting sustainable, resource efficient, innovative, competitive and knowledge based fisheries EMFF support under this priority will focus on innovation and added value that can make the fisheries sector economically viable and resilient to external shocks and to competition from countries not in the European Union. This will promote environmentally sustainable, resource efficient, competitive fisheries which are more selective, produce less discards, and do less damage to marine ecosystems. Projects that fall under this priority could be for: research and innovation in new technologies that increase the selectivity of gear energy efficiency improvements to fish processing technology restoration of marine ecosystems Fostering sustainable, resource efficient, innovative, competitive and knowledge based aquaculture Aims to ensure the aquaculture sector is environmentally sustainable, resource efficient and competitive, and help such businesses to become green, economically viable and competitive, while providing EU consumers with healthy and highly nutritional products. Projects that fall under this priority could be for: investment in technology which improves aquaculture potential sharing best practice on sustainable aquaculture Fostering the implementation of the CFP Supports the implementation of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) through the collection and management of data to improve scientific knowledge. This also supports the monitoring, control and enforcement of fisheries legislations. Increasing employment and territorial cohesion Aims to increase employment and promote economic growth and social inclusion in coastal and inland communities dependent on fishing. Projects that fall under this priority could be for: implementing community-led local development strategies though Fisheries Local Action Groups (FLAGs) Fostering marketing and processing Aims to improve market organisation for fishery and aquaculture products, processing and marketing sectors. Projects that fall under this priority could be for: setting up Producer Organisations organising certification schemes to increase the value of catches investment in technology to increase opportunities to use by-catch Fostering the implementation of the Integrated Maritime Policy The Integrated Maritime Policy is a European policy which aims to provide a more coherent approach to maritime issues. It focuses on issues that do not fall under other sector-based policies and where coordination of different sectors is required. Projects that fall under this priority could be for: increased international cooperation in areas that support the overall aims of the policy What EMFF funds can support The fund provides support for sustainable development within the fishing and aquaculture sectors and conservation of the marine environment, alongside growth and jobs in coastal communities in the UK. You can apply for funding for things like: investments on board fishing vessels gear replacements improvements to shore-based facilities advisory services, partnerships, training and innovation investments in fisheries management and seafood processing investments in aquaculture, animal health and inland fishing Details on eligibility criteria can be found in the General Guidance note.

/government/publications/mapping-uk-shipping-density-and-routes-from-ais-mmo-1066,"The MMO has developed a new system to map locations of commercial and passenger vessels, to inform marine planning.   Mapping UK shipping density and routes from AIS (MMO 1066)  Marine Management Organisation UK shipping density maps and routes can be created to form a UK AIS dataset for 2011, 2012 and into the future as new data becomes available. The maps will help improve users understanding of sea area use by shipping. The tools and routines created by this project are designed to decode and display AIS data supplied by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency ( MCA ) which has been collected by their network of UK receiving stations. Through the use of common routines and methodology, future AIS processing and analysis can be conducted by UK administrations to a consistent and commonly agreed approach. The report was published on 4 June 2014. Data analysis software tool As part of this project, the Marine Management Organisation ( MMO ) developed open source software tools to process AIS data that can be downloaded using following link: MMO1066 AIS tool distribution package . The tool is available under open government license you do not require permission to develop it for your own needs; however we would be interested to learn of the work you carry out with the tool and any improvements you may make to tool. This is the context for the data analysis tool developed by this project – indicated as 2 in the following steps. 1. Raw data The first step in the process is to get raw data. For this project this was AIS shipping transits data – this was positions broadcast by vessels of 300 gross tonnes or more in UK waters, provided by MCA . If you are beginning at this stage, you must get raw data independent of MMO . 2. Data analysis tool A data analysis tool is then used to process the raw data into a format that is compatible with use in geographic information system ( GIS ) software. This processing focuses on producing data that can be analysed by categories attributed to it, like type of vessel (in the case of AIS data). This processing has been completed for AIS data in all waters within reception range (approximately 40 nautical miles) of the UK AIS receivers. The 2011 and 2012 AIS data derived density grid products are available through www.data.gov.uk . 3. Processed data At the end of data analysis by the tool, data compatible with GIS software is produced. 4. GIS software Data sets can now be fed into GIS software such as ArcGIS. 5. Spatial information Through GIS software, data can be interrogated, such as by category, to produce spatial representation reflecting attributes defined for the data, like a shipping density map."

The sooner you can get back to us the better so we can continue assessing your application. Assessing your application We will then decide whether to give you funding under the EMFF scheme, using specific selection criteria. This will either be done by the MMO or by a selection panel depending on the cost of your project. In England, if the value of your project is less than £100,000, the European Grants team will assess your application. If the value is higher than £100,000, a selection panel will assess your application. The selection panel meets 3 three times a year: The timetable of selection panel meeting dates and deadlines to submit applications for panel consideration will be published here shortly. Your application for funding will be assessed against a set of objectives which have been agreed with the EMFF Programme Monitoring Committee (PMC) which is made up of representatives from the fisheries, aquaculture and NGO sectors amongst others. This assessment will establish how your application for funding support the overall aims of the UK EMFF programme. Further details on the specific areas your application will be assessed against can be found within the [InlineAttachment:10]. Once your application has been assessed we will contact you to tell you our decision. Once your application has been approved, you will receive an offer letter. This letter will tell you: the amount of money you have been awarded and where the money is coming from the schedule of works agreed and the supplier responsible how the project is funded (who is providing funds and how much) a breakdown of the costs approved (for example, equipment purchase and salaries) any targets your project will need to achieve in order to receive the money the date your project will need to be completed by the date your claim(s) will need to be submitted by (taken from your application) any other terms and conditions associated with the offer what you need to do next You will need to accept this offer of EMFF funds before you can make a claim. We will also include a form for you to provide us with your bank details to enable you to receive payment for your claim. Publicity The European Commission and the MMO will publish brief details of all successful projects, including your name or your organisation’s name as applicable, a description of the project and broad details of any grants awarded; this is called the Transparency Initiative. In addition projects must acknowledge they have received European funding to the public. Projects must display; (a) The Union emblem in accordance with the technical characteristics are available on the EC website (b) A reference to the Fund or Funds supporting the operation. This is most likely to be the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund ( EMFF ) however it’s possible you have received funding from other European Funds in which case a reference the ‘ESI Funds’ meets requirements c) Providing on the beneficiary’s website, where such a website exists, a short description of the operation, proportionate to the level of support, including its aims and results, and highlighting the financial support from the Union; (d) Placing, for operations not falling under point c above, at least one poster with information about the project (minimum size A3), including the financial support from the Union, at a location readily visible to the public, such as the entrance area of a building. and; No later than three months after completion of the project, you must put up a permanent plaque or billboard of significant size at a location readily visible to the public for each project that fulfils the following criteria: The total public funding for the project exceeds EUR 500 000 (based on the exchange rate at the time of application); The project consists of the purchase of a physical object or of the financing of infrastructure or of construction operations. The plaque or billboard shall state the name of the project as well as the EU logo, MMO logo and the phrase ‘Investing in sustainable fisheries’. If you are required to put up a plaque or billboard as above and you do not you will be deemed to have not fulfilled the terms and conditions of the grant awarded to you and funding may be recovered. Durability of Operations To ensure the effectiveness, fairness and sustainable impact of the intervention of the EMFF scheme, provisions guaranteeing that investments in businesses and infrastructures are long-lasting and prevent European Funding from being used to undue advantage should be in place. Therefore items purchased using public funding from the EMFF Scheme must be owned and used for their original purpose for a minimum of five years, except where State aid rules provide for a different period or the items are leased, see the Leasing of items or equipment section for more advice. In the case of a project comprising investment in infrastructure or productive investment, and where the applicant is not a Micro, small or medium enterprise (SME), an applicant will be required to repay the funding contribution from the EMFF if, within 10 years of the final payment to the project, the project or its activity is subject to relocation outside of the European Union. Some or all of the funding for projects that do not meet the Durability of Operations above will be recovered. If your application is declined If the MMO declines your application, you will be sent a letter that explains why. You can appeal this decision through the MMO if you think that: it was based on a factual error it was legally wrong the MMO made an error in processing your application You have 28 days after the date of the decline letter to ask the MMO to review their decision. An Independent appeal officer will consider your application in full against the selection criteria. The appeal will either pass which means the original decision is overturned or fail and the original decision is upheld. We will notify you of the outcome of your appeal within 6 weeks of receiving it. If your appeal is successful and the original decision is overturned you will be issued with either an offer of funds letter or a partial offer letter.

/government/publications/the-garden-bridge,"Information on a marine licence application (MLA/2016/00048) for The Garden Bridge The Garden Bridge  Marine Management Organisation On 9 February 2016 The Garden Bridge Trust submitted an application to the Marine Management Organisation (MMO) for a marine licence to construct The Garden Bridge, a proposed pedestrian bridge over the River Thames in London. The Project includes a proposed new pedestrian bridge crossing the River Thames between Temple Underground Station and Queen’s Walk in London. The Bridge will be approximately 360m in length and vary in width between approximately 6m and 33m. The site includes land on the North Bank of the Thames near Temple Underground Station, including the northern foreshore of the Thames, and land on the South Bank incorporating The Queens Walk and the southern foreshore of the Thames. The Project also includes the relocation of HQS Wellington, currently moored at the western end of Temple Stairs, approximately 38m downstream. The relocation will require the installation of new mooring dolphins, access ramps and floating platforms to access the vessel in its new position. The existing dolphins and ramps will be removed making the new position permanent. Due to the shallow water level around the ship some dredging is required. The Project also includes the relocation of Crown River Cruise berths. The MMO determined the marine licence application on 29 July 2016 and all information relating to the MMO’s decision is contained within the Environmental Impact Assessment consent decision report. The marine licence L/2016/00218/1 is available from the marine licensing public register .

/government/news/register-for-marine-noise-introduced,"A Marine Noise Registry has been introduced by Defra and JNCC to collect and display data on noisy activities in the marine area.  Register for marine noise introduced Marine licences Wildlife and habitat conservation Marine Management Organisation The MNR is to record human activities in UK seas that produce loud, low to medium frequency (10Hz – 10kHz) impulsive noise. Marine licence applicants may be asked to provide additional data about the noise impact of their projects through the MNR . Where possible data is extracted from current marine licensing processes, however in some band 3 cases it will be mandatory for developers to provide information as a condition of their marine licence. This depends on the type of activity carried out and will be explained within relevant marine licence documents. For cases that involve impulsive noise impacts but are not band 3, conditions will not be added, but developers will be asked to submit data on a voluntary basis. When the MMO is asked to provide advice on Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects (NSIPs) which involve relevant types of noise it will recommend to the Planning Inspectorate and the applicant that the MNR conditions are added to the deemed marine licences. Developers using the MNR to provide information on seismic surveys no longer need to complete the voluntary form to notify the MMO. Data collected through the MNR will help the UK to assess its ability to achieve ‘good environmental status’ under the Marine Strategy Framework Directive. Information from the register will also be fed into a Europe-wide registry through OSPAR (the Oslo and Paris Convention for the Protection of the North-East Atlantic)."
/government/publications/plymouth-dredged-material-disposal-site-selection-phase-1,"Information on the completion of Phase 1 of a study to find the optimal site for disposal of dredged material in the Plymouth area. Plymouth Dredged Material Disposal Site Selection – Phase 1  Marine Management Organisation The dredging and disposal of material from ports, harbours, berths and marinas within the River Tamar and Plymouth Sound area is an ongoing activity that has been undertaken for over one hundred years. The dredged material has historically been disposed to the Rame Head South disposal site (PL031), a long standing open disposal site located approximately 6 km to the west of Plymouth Sound. In light of the continued requirement for dredging and disposal operations and the increased regulatory burden surrounding the Rame Head disposal site, the Marine Management Organisation (MMO) is working with users of the site in leading a disposal site characterisation study to identify an optimal, sustainable alternative site for long-term dredged material disposal operations. In December 2015 the Marine Management Organisation commissioned Cefas to undertake a site selection exercise as part of a characterisation study to identify potential alternative dredged material disposal sites.

/government/news/mmo-clarifies-rules-around-rescue-of-cetaceans,"The MMO has explained the rules around rescuing protected marine species. MMO clarifies rules around rescue of cetaceans Wildlife and habitat conservation Marine Management Organisation Following the death of a dolphin in Brixham the Marine Management Organisation has clarified the regulations covering attempts to rescue them. Dolphins, porpoises and whales are protected marine species. Wildlife legislation including the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010 generally makes activity disturbing, harming or killing them an offence. However if someone is coming to the aid of an animal classed as disabled then activities are covered by a defence in the legislation. With regards to the recent situation in Brixham the MMO has confirmed that the activity was permissible under legislation as an ill dolphin attempting to beach itself would be considered disabled and therefore no offences were committed by rescuers. The MMO has previously issued guidance about how to safely watch marine wildlife and recommends people make themselves aware of the WiSe scheme. . Guidance has also been published on observing seals. If you find a stranded marine mammal If you find a stranded animal please do not return them to the sea as they may need time to recover. Contact the British Divers Marine Life Rescue or RSPCA for advice. If you see mammals being disturbed If you see marine mammals being disturbed, please contact your nearest MMO office or local police force wildlife crime officer on 101. In Cornwall incidents can also be reported to the Cornwall Wildlife Trust on their 24 hour hotline 0345 201 2626."
/government/news/agreement-on-way-forward-for-river-thames-regulation,"A streamlined approach to regulating development in the River Thames has been agreed by the MMO and Port of London Authority Agreement on way forward for River Thames regulation Marine licences Marine Management Organisation The ‘Thames Concordat’ is a new set of principles both organisations will follow in cases where both the Marine Management Organisation ( MMO ) and Port of London Authority ( PLA ) have a regulatory remit. It aims to limit duplication for businesses seeking to carry out development in the Thames. Under the Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009 (MCAA) the MMO regulates activities in the marine area. This includes the tidal area of rivers such as the Thames. The PLA has a statutory responsibility for navigation, hydrodynamics, promoting the use of the river and for licensing works and dredging. The Concordat applies to areas where there is duplication between the MMO ’s and the PLA ’s statutory responsibilities. It covers from the PLA ’s seaward limits in the Outer Thames Estuary to its landward limits at Teddington Lock (the Tidal Thames) and tidal tributaries. Staff from the MMO and PLA will follow five key principles when considering applications for development in the Thames where both organisations have a regulatory remit: provide a single point of entry into the regulatory system for seeking consent for development establish a single lead authority for coordinating the requirements of Environmental Impact Assessment Directive or Habitats Regulations Assessments act on available opportunities for coordinating, dispensing or deferring regulatory responsibilities communicate the likely evidence requirements of all authorities as early as possible in the consent process coordinate the advice provided to applicants across their respective organisations The agreement continues the closer working between the two organisations with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs considering delegating powers under the MCAA from the MMO to the PLA . Shaun Nicholson, head of marine licensing at the Marine Management Organisation, said: “Since the MMO vested in 2010 we’ve continued to develop the marine licensing process which has resulted in a quicker turnaround and improved experience for applicants. “This agreement is a blueprint for setting out the more streamlined way in which we want to work in regulating activities in the Thames in future.” Jim Trimmer, PLA director of planning and environment said: “We are pleased to introduce the Thames Concordat, which marks a step forward in developing more efficient regulation on the River Thames. “We look forward to further efficiency improvement through the Thames Tideway Tunnel project and ultimately the delegation of marine licensing powers to the PLA .” The Thames agreement is a tailored version of the Coastal Concordat which was launched by Defra in Autumn 2013. Through the Coastal Concordat the MMO other regulators are improving co-ordination on coastal developments. The Concordat aims to enable sustainable growth in the coastal zone and reduce cost and delay for businesses. More information about the Thames Concordat is available on the Government and PLA websites."

/government/news/noise-and-windfarm-construction-off-the-sussex-coast,"The Marine Management Organisation (MMO) has been looking into concerns about noise off the Sussex coast and the Rampion Offshore Wind Farm. Noise and windfarm construction off the Sussex coast Marine licences Marine Management Organisation Officers from the MMO have visited the area where noise has been reported. We are also working closely with the developer to understand and address any relevant concerns. The windfarm developer, E.On, has made a number of changes to their processes to reduce noise impact. These include: installing noise-reducing acoustic panels around pump equipment onshore (which for safety reasons has to run continuously) reducing speed of vessels and using anchors so that engines can be turned off scheduling maintenance activities where noisy tools are required to be in day time only instructing vessels leaving Shoreham Port at night to follow a different route in order to minimise impact on residences at Shoreham Beach The developer has also committed to avoiding piling activity overnight when weather conditions mean excessive noise may carry to shore, for example during warm, still nights. Any further issues can be reported to the MMO by emailing info@marinemanagement.org.uk or calling 0300 123 1032. Please note the date, time and location of any occurrences so that these can be looked into. Background to the Rampion development E.On was given a Development Consent Order by the Government to construct Rampion Offshore Windfarm in July 2014. This followed careful consideration of the application and a supporting environmental statement. The statement assessed the potential noise impacts including airborne noise and concluded there would be no significant impact as a result of piling activities to construct the wind farm. Developments are only licensed when the Government is satisfied they meet legal requirements and any effects on the environment and quality of life are minimised. The work includes constructing 175 wind turbine generators, with the closest turbine being about 13km from the shore. Further details of the environmental impact assessment performed by the developers is available on the Planning Inspectorate website. Details of the MMO’s marine licensing remit with regards to the development are available elsewhere on this website."

/government/publications/north-sea-cod-catch-quota-trials-final-report-2015,"This report provides the results of the North Sea cod fully documented fishery scheme for 2015. North sea cod catch quota trials: Final Report 2015  Marine Management Organisation A trial was undertaken in 2015 with 18 vessels in the North Sea. Each vessel was fitted with Remote Electronic Monitoring (REM) and was required to operate under a discard ban for North Sea (Area IV) cod. Additional quota for use in fully documented fisheries provided for under the 2015 quota regulations was allocated to participants. The main aims of the trial were to: provide evidence and experience from the scheme in advance of the demersal landing obligation being phased in from 2016; investigate the potential of using market grading data for reference fleet monitoring; better understand the impact of the Catch Quota scheme and the landing obligation on the fishing industry Fishing operations were monitored for compliance with the requirement to retain and land all catches of cod by means of an audit of REM data and CCTV footage. In addition, the distribution of size-grades of landed cod was analysed as a means of providing an indication of possible high-grading amongst participant and non-participant vessels. Compliance monitoring and grade comparisons were both indicative of compliance with the scheme. In addition, cod length data generated from CCTV footage also correlated closely with the landed size distribution calculated from market grading data. These measures provide confidence that, as in previous years, there is a good level of compliance with the scheme. The report considers the extent to which REM monitored vessels can be considered as representative of the wider fleet (i.e. to act as a ‘reference fleet’). The results show a significant variation spatially and temporally in the size distribution of cod catch by participant vessels and more recent analysis suggests significant spatial variance between participant and non-participant vessels. Such variance is likely to impact the level of confidence that can be drawn from monitoring a subset of vessels and therefore further analysis in this area is recommended. Some of the trial participants have reported specific adaptations to avoid juvenile cod. These have included adding square mesh panels, increasing mesh size above legislative minimum requirements and behavioural adaptations. The main behavioural adaption reported has been avoidance of areas with known high levels of undersize fish. Work is ongoing in 2016 to study spatial variance between participant and non-participant fleets. This work has the potential to provide evidence of the reported spatial avoidance by the FDF fleet. It is considered that there is the potential for REM to provide a means of retrospective auditing of real-time, industry-reported data such as juvenile fish abundance. This could allow juvenile real time closures to be triggered accurately and in genuinely real time. In addition, REM can be used to generate spatial and temporal trends in length frequency data with potential for scientific use."

/government/news/fishing-industry-in-2015-statistics-published,"The Marine Management Organisation (MMO) has published its annual UK Sea Fisheries Statistics 2015. Fishing industry in 2015 statistics published  Marine Management Organisation It includes details on the UK fleet, the number of fishermen, the quantity and value of UK landings, international trade, worldwide fishing and the state of key stocks. The report highlights that in 2015: The quantity and value of sea fish (which include shellfish) landed by UK vessels has decreased by 7 per cent and 10 per cent respectively on 2014. UK vessels landed 708 thousand tonnes of sea fish into the UK and abroad with a value of £775 million. The decrease in landings was primarily driven by an 11 per cent decrease in pelagic landings, due to a fall in mackerel quota from the peak in 2014. Pelagic landing are still far higher than they were a few years ago. Mackerel and herring accounted for almost half of UK fleet landings (48 per cent) but a lower share in value (25 per cent). The Scottish and Northern Irish fleets caught mainly pelagic fish. Demersal fish account for the highest share of the English fleet’s catch and shellfish are predominately caught by the Welsh fleet. The UK fishing fleet remained seventh largest in the EU in terms of vessel numbers, with the second largest capacity and fourth largest engine power. Seventy three per cent of the quantity landed by the UK fleet was caught by vessels over 24 metres in length which accounted for 4 per cent of the total number of UK vessels. These vessels tend to catch lower value pelagic fish, their overall share of the value of the UK catch is 57 per cent. Around 12,100 fishermen were active in the UK. Over 1,900 were part-time. Scottish vessels accounted for 62 per cent of the quantity of landings by the UK fleet while English vessels accounted for 29 per cent. Peterhead remained the port with the highest landings – 127 thousand tonnes with a value of £111 million. Plymouth had the highest quantity of landings in England – 13,400 tonnes with a value of £15 million, closely followed by Brixham with 12,400 tonnes but with the higher value of £23 million. Exports of fish decreased by 12 per cent to 443 thousand tonnes compared with 2014. Over the same period, 681 thousand tonnes were imported, a fall of 6 per cent. World figures for 2014 showed that China caught the largest amount of fish, 15.0 million tonnes. Indonesia had the second largest catch at 6.0 million tonnes.

/guidance/marine-licensing-sediment-analysis-and-sample-plans,"Details of sediment and sample analysis for marine licence applications. Marine Licensing: sediment analysis and sample plans Marine licences Marine Management Organisation Details of sediment and sample analysis for marine licence applications and requirements for minor removal activities Sampling and sediment analysis You must submit results of sediment sample analysis to the MMO along with a marine licence application where applicable. Before you apply for a licence, specific analysis requirements for chemical and physical determinands (something being tested for) and an associated sampling plan will need to be agreed by MMO . Biological testing may be required where physical and chemical analysis is considered insufficient. If biological testing is necessary, advice will be provided. Laboratories should see the guidance on physical and chemical determinands for sampling and sediment analysis Submit data You must use the results template to submit sediment analysis data in support of a marine licence application. !@1 Your results should be a single report. Laboratories must also provide chain of custody evidence in support of the analysis results to prove samples have been handled and stored correctly. Storage requirements for samples are detailed in this guidance. MMO will return any incomplete submissions to you and this may delay the marine licence application process. Use existing data You may use existing analytical data on the physical and chemical properties of sediments during an application. The information must be reliable and collected within 3 calendar years of your valid marine licence application being received and accepted by MMO . You should engage with MMO at the earliest opportunity to establish suitability and relevance of existing data for use before relying on existing data. MMO requires evidence that the data complies with storage, analysis and quality control requirements. You must provide full information on the original analysis of samples using laboratory capability statements and laboratory methodological statements if the data was collected outside the marine licensing process. Laboratory capability MMO must ensure that sediment analysis data submitted to support an application are consistent and comparable between separate applications and to the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science’s action levels . These are currently used by MMO to decide how suitable it is to dispose of dredged sediments at sea. You must make sure that sediment analysis is performed by a competent laboratory. A laboratory may choose to sub-contract analysis of samples for specific determinands to alternative laboratories. Any sub-contracted laboratories must also meet the same requirements. Laboratories must submit a laboratory capability statement confirming they meet minimum standards before you apply for your licence. This is so the laboratory’s capability can be validated. !@2 The capability statement includes: being ISO/IEC 17025 accredited for particle size analysis, successfully participating in the National Marine Biological Analytical Quality Control ( NMBAQC ) Particle Analysis Size ring test for chemical analysis, successfully participating twice a year in QUASIMEME (Quality Assurance of Information for Marine Environmental Monitoring in Europe) over a minimum of 2 years Laboratories are encouraged to engage with MMO before you apply to validate the capability statement. Laboratories that have been validated to undertake sediment analysis to inform marine licence applications can be found in the table below, alongside the determinands they have been validated to analyse. Table 1 – Laboratories validated by MMO for sediment analysis to inform marine licence applications and validated determinands Yes - determinands validated No - determinands unvalidated   Cefas National Laboratory Service – Environment Agency Inorganics (inc.

Laboratories must provide details of methodologies and quality control processes for the sample analyses they perform. A laboratory must submit a methodological statement for particle size analysis and for each group of, or individual, determinands where methods differ. The statement or statements must be submitted before you apply for your licence. This is so the laboratory’s methods can be validated. !@3 The laboratory must detail performance characteristics of the methods within the methodological statement and must meet the minimum performance requirements described below. Laboratories can use methods other than those specified, but must demonstrate fitness for purpose within the methodological statement. Sediment analysis outputs must be comparable with those obtained using the methods detailed here. MMO must validate methodologies not previously accepted or changes to previously accepted methodologies before analysis outputs are accepted in support of an application. Laboratories are encouraged to engage with MMO to agree appropriate methodologies before you apply. MMO may request extra documentation to support the application. This may include but is not limited to: audit reports and improvement actions from UK Accreditation Service surveillance visits chemical reference material control charts instrumental reports for each sample including calibration curves full raw data from the analysis including procedural blanks or blank reagent results MMO may charge for validating the method and this may extend the length of the decision-making process for any application. London Protocol and OSPAR The UK is signed up to the London Protocol and OSPAR Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic , both of which address preventing marine pollution from disposal at sea. MMO licenses disposing of dredged materials at sea and uses guidelines produced by OSPAR to regulate this activity. A marine licence to dispose of dredged materials to sea requires the sediments to be characterised to allow the potential adverse environmental effects of disposing of the material to be considered. The OSPAR guidelines recommend a tiered approach to assess the sediments if sufficient information is not already available from existing sources. The assessments required will depend upon the specific details of the proposed activities, although characterisation of a standard set of physical and chemical determinands within the sediments is often necessary. Suitability of material Marine licence application chemical analysis results are assessed against the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas) action levels and geological background levels. The action levels are used to determine the contaminant loading of the material and it’s suitability for disposal at sea. Current Cefas action levels are provided in the table below: Contaminant or compound Action Level 1 (mg/kg dry weight (ppm)) Action Level 2 (mg/kg dry weight (ppm)) Arsenic 20 100 Mercury 0.3 3 Cadmium 0.4 5 Chromium 40 400 Copper 40 400 Nickel 20 200 Lead 50 500 Zinc 130 800 Organotins (TBT, DBT, MBT) 0.1 1 PCBs – sum of ICES 7 0.01 None PCBs – sum of 25 congeners 0.02 0.2 PAHs 0.1 None DDT *0.001   Dieldrin *0.005   These levels were set in 1994.

/guidance/fishing-activity-and-landings-data-collection-and-processing,"How data on landings statistics are collected and processed by fisheries administrations in the UK.  Fishing data collection, coverage, processing and revisions  Marine Management Organisation Fishing statistics are calculated using data collected and processed by fisheries administrations in the UK: Marine Management Organisation ( MMO ) Marine Scotland Department of Agriculture and Rural Development Northern Ireland (DARD) Welsh Government Departments in Jersey, Guernsey and Isle of Man The activity data collected are part of the monitoring and control of fishing activity required by each Member State under various sets of EU legislation. There are two main pieces of legislation that set out these requirements: The basic legislation that sets out the measures under the EU Common Fisheries Policy: Council regulation (EU) No. 1380/2013 The legislation that sets out the control system for ensuring compliance with the rules of the common fisheries policy: Council regulation (EU) No. 1224/2009 . This requires skippers to keep and submit logbooks, and provide landing declarations and sales notes. The responsibility for fisheries management and control within the UK is a devolved matter and there is a significant degree of delegation of responsibility to each administration. Fisheries administrations have autonomy in how they manage activity allowing each administration to structure its operations in ways that suit their own specific management issues. However, all administrations work together to ensure that collectively there are common standards of monitoring and enforcement of EU legislation. In addition to the reporting requirements that are set out in EU legislation, the master, owner or charterer of a licensed fishing vessel can be required to provide statistical information and other information. Details are in the Sea Fisheries (Conservation) Act 1967 and the Sea Fish (Conservation) Act 1992 . The method and exact nature of the data collected on fishing activity depends on the length of the vessel. Data collection for vessels over 10 metres in length The fishing logbook is the primary method of data collection. It captures data on fishing activity by individual vessels by trip, and for each day of activity within a trip. This includes details of the catch, by species, in terms of the presentation and quantity of fish retained on board. Information is also collected on the fishing gear used and the area where the fish were caught. Area details are division, rectangle and zone as defined by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea ( ICES ). Supplying logbook data is legally required for all over 10 metre vessels for catches of all species. Data for UK vessels must be submitted within 48 hours of landing to UK authorities – this includes landings into foreign ports. Landing declarations provide information on the weight and presentation of fish landed by species. As with logbooks, landing declarations must be submitted to authorities within 48 hours of landing. Sales notes are required in respect of first sales of fish and fishery products. Sales notes for first sales of fish must be submitted within 48 hours of sale (24 hours if submitting electronically) by the registered buyer of the fish, except at designated auction centres where the registered seller has responsibility. From 1 July 2012, UK fisheries administrations have been enforcing a strict expectation that all UK fishing vessels 15 metres and over in length should be reporting logbook and landing declaration data electronically. Fisheries administrations have now extended this to vessels 12 metres and over in length. Also, from 1 January 2009, buyers and sellers with an annual turnover of first sale fish of more than €400,000 have been required to submit sales notes electronically. This threshold was reduced to €200,000 from 1 January 2011. A UK electronic reporting systems (ERS) hub has been set-up to collect, process, and store the data. The requirements to report data on fishing activity are set out by EU legislation. Each fisheries administration operates a system of checking the individual submissions of data to ensure their accuracy and completeness. The rules applied are common across each administration and based on the structure set out in EU legislation for the fishing logbook, landing declaration and sales notes. These checks are to ensure that valid data are reported within the returns and that internal checks within the submitted data are carried out to ensure consistency. In addition there are systems in place that carry out cross-checks between the activity data reported and other sources of information on activity. These include satellite position reports and sightings of vessels collected by each administration during air, sea or land surveillance activities. UK fisheries administrations therefore operate common standards and procedures to ensure the consistent treatment of the data within the collection processes. This ensures that UK data are consistent with EU requirements for completeness and accuracy. The electronic reporting systems operated by fishing vessels contain a limited range of validation checks to help ensure correct data are reported. The electronic hub that receives and processes the data has additional checks using a suite of business rules and generates failure messages that are set to the vessel operators in cases whether the business rules are breached. Skippers would be required to resubmit corrected data. The data entry systems used to capture information from paper declarations contains similar checks. In cases where a discrepancy has been identified, corrections are made to the data as appropriate. Any discrepancy found could be indicative of a breach of EU legislation, either in terms of incorrect reporting of activity or the activity reported might be in breach of EU requirements. These discrepancies are investigated and appropriate actions taken. These can range from a simple verbal instruction to the vessel operator advising them of how to correctly report information, up to a full prosecution of the master and/or owners of the vessels concerned if a serious offence has been found to have been committed. Minor issues are usually corrected during the data capture process. For more serious and larger scale issues then corrections may not be made until after the results of prosecutions are known. Details of recent prosecutions carried out by the MMO can be found in the enforcement news section. Data collection for vessels 10 metres and under in length For 10 metre and under vessels, there is no statutory requirement for fishermen to declare their catches. Historically, information for this sector has been collected with the co-operation of the industry and included: log sheets and landing declarations voluntarily supplied by fishermen sales notes and assessments of landings collected from market sources and by officials located in the ports This data collection has been replaced after the Registration of Buyers and Sellers of First-Sale Fish Scheme was introduced in September 2005. Registered buyers are now legally required to provide sales notes for commercially sold fish. During 2005 and 2006, UK fisheries administrations introduced a system of restrictive licensing for activity targeted at shellfish. As part of this system, new reporting requirements were introduced requiring fishermen fishing with 10 metre and under vessels to complete diaries of their daily activity to be submitted each month. Summary information from these diaries is now in use in Northern Ireland but was discontinued in the rest of the UK at the end of February 2009. Data coverage Data collection for vessels over 10 metres in length aims to achieve full coverage of activity by this sector of the fleet, i.e. these vessels are required to submit complete details on their activity every time they go to sea to fish commercially. For the 10 metre and under sector, landings are recorded on sales notes provided by the registered buyers. Some information, such as gear and fishing area, are not recorded on the sales note but this information is added by coastal staff based on local knowledge of the vessels they administer - for example, from observations of the vessel during inspections at ports or from air and sea surveillance activities as well as discussions with the owner and/or operator of the vessel. From 1 January 2011 the Isle of Man authorities became fully integrated with the data collection and recording systems operated by mainland fisheries administrations, enabling the inclusion of details of the activity of their vessels that was previously not available. This meant the aggregate summary totals the Isle of Man previously supplied to supplement UK activity data were replaced by records showing the same level of detail as provided by mainland vessels. Landings for the larger Channel Islands fleet are also recorded on the data systems, but relatively small amounts of landings by the smaller vessels (less than one tenth of one per cent of all UK fleet landings) are not included. Details of these landings are provided by Jersey and Guernsey authorities for quota management purposes but they are excluded from the monthly statistics publication. The reliability of the data collected is dependent on the information provided by fishermen. The reporting requirements on fishermen are set out by EU legislation with each administration producing guidance notes for fishermen on what their reporting obligations are. As mentioned above, UK fisheries administrations carry out a mix of manual and automatic checks on the information provided by vessel operators. These include a check between logbook information and that given in the sales notes or observed as landed as well as checks against other sources of information like satellite position reports, information from aerial and at-sea surveillance and inspection activity carried out by UK enforcement officers. Despite legal obligations for fishermen to declare their catches, a proportion of fishing activity remains unreported. A 2009 study jointly funded by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Department for International Development (Agnew DJ, Pearce J, Pramod G, Peatman T, Watson R, et al. (2009) Estimating the Worldwide Extent of Illegal Fishing. PloS ONE 4(2):e4570) estimated that between 2000 and 2003, illegal fishing in the northeast Atlantic amounted to between 5 and 13 per cent of reported catches of species studied. So the extent of illegal and unreported fishing by UK vessels is uncertain and will vary across stocks. However, it is considered that the overall level of unreported fishing has been reduced in recent years following the introduction of a scheme of registration for buyers and sellers of first-sale fish, and the implementation of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1005/2008 establishing a Community system to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. The statistics published in the monthly return represent landings reported to the fisheries administrations. Landings do not typically equal total catches, as fish may be discarded. Discarding could occur in cases where fishermen would accidently catch fish which they did not have quota for, catch damaged or less profitable fish, or catch undersized fish which they could not sell. The degree of discarding varies by stock, and with the area and type of fishing being carried out. Details of levels of discards can be found in the advice released by ICES each year as it forms an important element of the assessment of the state of fish stocks. The EU’s new landing obligation, being phased in from 2015 onwards, is intended to end the discarding of marketable fish back into the sea, which has proved to be bad for fish stocks, bad for the marine environment and costly for fishermen. A specific assessment has been collated of this information for fisheries including those that take place around the UK or are of interest to UK fishing vessels that will be covered by the landing obligation. More details are available at: discard Atlas of North Sea fisheries discard Atlas of the North Western Waters demersal fisheries To allow fishermen to adapt to the change, the landing obligation will be introduced gradually, between 2015 and 2019 for all commercial fisheries of species subject to annual quotas. As of 1 January 2015, the landing obligation has been in force for pelagic and industrial fishing, as well as for salmon and cod fisheries in the Baltic. Therefore the figures presented in the monthly statistics should not be interpreted as total removals from the sea; the figures are the reported live weight of fish landings. Data processing Information from log sheets, landing declarations, sales notes and other sources is keyed into computers connected to the main databases by government staff at port offices, or is transferred electronically from the UK ERS Hub. Individual database structures will differ for each fisheries administration but the details collected will be the same. Data from each administration’s database are merged into a single unified database for analysis. Details of the areas fished are taken from the logbooks and entered as codes for the ICES divisions and statistical rectangles. Where a statistical rectangle is split into different areas – for instance, where it’s partly in EU waters and partly in Norwegian waters – an extra code is used to indicate the zone fished. Where a vessel fishes in more than one area in a single trip, the total amounts for the trip of each species, as given in the sales notes and landing declarations are allocated to the areas in proportion to the estimated quantities of the species taken from each area, as recorded in the logbook. In many cases only the weight of fish landed is provided, as it is impractical to record the weight of fish at the time of capture due to working conditions. The landed weight may differ significantly from the weight of the fish as it was taken from the sea, in large part due to the processing of the catch on board the vessel, such as gutting and filleting. To render the data comparable, the landed weights are automatically converted to a live weight equivalent using standard EU conversion factors according to the species landed and its presentation, e.g. gutted or skinned. The data capture systems used include sets of business rules to check that the data being submitted for each fishing trip conform to certain standards – this includes checking individual data items to ensure that they are valid entries (e.g. a date is a valid date, text is not entered where a number is expected, valid information for ports visited or species landed are reported etc.) The business rules are maintained by database managers and reviewed by statisticians on a regular basis. The complete fishing records are transmitted to the central computer systems where further checks are carried out on the data before they are reflected in the main landings databases. These checks include more detailed processing of the data reported for a fishing trip comparing the data elements reports to make sure that the information for a trip is internally consistent – e.g. making sure that a date of landing is after the date of departure for a trip. In addition to the validation processes listed above, the information reported by fishermen is run through automatic cross-checks with other sources of information on activity available to fisheries administrations to ensure consistency and accuracy in the information reported. The majority of these checks are mandated within the EU legislation. These checks include comparing the activity data reported against the satellite tracking data that larger fishing vessels are required to operate while they are at sea; checking the information reported in logbooks against the data reported by auction centres and fish merchants for fish sold by the vessel operators; comparisons against any information on sightings of vessels while at sea by fisheries administrations’ surveillance vessels and aerial surveillance. Regular checks on data validity are also carried out by the statistics team as an extra safeguard. These include identifying unlikely combinations of species and fishing area which are reported to port staff for correction where necessary. In addition to the processes and checks outlined above to ensure the quality of the data captured and held on fishing activity, the European Commission and its associated bodies carry out inspections and audits of the UK’s systems to control fishing activity. Within these inspections, visiting officials investigate various aspects of the overall administrative processes in place to control fishing activity to review the degree to which they comply with the EU legislative obligations. Appropriate actions are taken in light of the results of these inspections to ensure that the administrative systems in place are fit for purpose and provide the required level of control on fishing activity. More information on the EU system for fisheries controls is available on the DG MARE website – the Directorate-General for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries. MMO holds information on all landings into England, Wales and Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man by UK vessels and of landings abroad by vessels administered by MMO , Welsh Government, DARD and Isle of Man Department of Environment, Food and Agriculture. Marine Scotland provides figures for landings into Scotland by all UK vessels and landings abroad by Scottish administered vessels. Once accepted as valid and complete, activity and landings data for the UK are compiled in a central database containing vital information from the systems managed by MMO and Marine Scotland. Regular checks, often as part of quota and effort management or analyses for enforcement purposes, are made on the quality of the data and unusual records referred to staff members in coastal offices to confirm or correct as necessary. Fisheries administrations also issue a breakdown of landings to the Producer Organisations who are asked to reconcile the landings with their members’ fishing trips as part of the validation process. Also, before the data are published, amendments are made to records with implausible average prices based on average prices for the same species. When calculating average prices, landings with zero value are excluded to give a true reflection of the price of fish being sold. There are various reasons why landings may have a zero value – some fish which cannot be sold and have a zero value, like undersized fish landed as part of catch quota work, or scientific dispensation landings that cannot be sold but have to be recorded in sales notes to allow cross checks with landing declarations. There are also instances where fish are not offered for sale or are intended for sale at a later date. This was a relatively new issue following the introduction of electronic reporting and mainly affected large landings of herring and mackerel into the Netherlands and Germany, accounting for around 5 per cent of all UK landings. However, a recent exercise saw imputed values, based on sales agents’ price figures, being added to the database for 2012 to 2014. This exercise is continuing for 2015 data and it is expected that the total weight of zero value landings will be far less than one per cent of all landings. Information can be found in Appendix 4 of UK Sea Fisheries Statistics . Data revisions: Policy MMO produces its annual statistical publication, UK Sea Fisheries Statistics, in September each year. A detailed breakdown of landings for 2015 were shown for the first time in the annual report while previously published data for 2011 to 2014 were revised to reflect the latest available figures. The magnitude of revisions is typically larger for more recent years although the size of revisions is usually very small. There will be a number of causes of revisions: receipt of additional data. Despite strict data reporting requirements, some data are not received or entered at the time of publication. revisions to data sources. Corrections are made to database entries throughout the year where these are found to be incorrect. In addition, for landings data systematic corrections are made to implausible quantities and values (including those trips with zero value) prior to production of the publication to reduce the influence of outliers rectification of data processing errors. Where data are found to have been incorrectly processed for a previous publication, these errors are corrected as soon as possible. Information on annual revisions can be found in Appendix 5 of UK Sea Fisheries Statistics . For the monthly statistical publication, data are presented for the current year-to-date as well as for the most recent month. Year-to-date figures are also compared with the same period in the previous year. So, for example, the August 2016 publication issued at the end of October 2016 will show cumulative figures for January to August 2016 as well as figures for August 2016. The year-to-date figures will be compared with those for January to August 2015. Current year data are based on the latest available figures from fisheries administrations’ data systems and will be subject to the same types of revision as described in (i) to (iii) above. Figures for 2015 and 2016 in the monthly return will be revised once UK Sea Fisheries Statistics is published in September 2017. All figures are therefore provisional. It is worth noting that the deadline for submitting 2015 catch data to the European Commission, primarily for quota and effort management purposes, was 15 February 2016. To ensure UK data reporting was as complete as possible, concerted efforts were made by coastal staff, at the end of 2015 and well into the New Year, to remove the backlog in data entry. Changes to 2015 data published in September 2016 were therefore relatively small. To see time series of historic landings based on data in the most recent editions of UK Sea Fisheries Statistics, the [InlineAttachment:3] (MS Excel Spreadsheet, 88KB) shows charts and data comparing total tonnage landed over the six year period for the following landings: UK vessels landing into the UK UK vessels landing abroad UK vessels landing into the UK and abroad Foreign vessels landing into the UK UK and foreign vessels landing into the UK !@3 Data revisions: Year to date figures Lags in data entry vary during the year – this reflects peaks and troughs in activity due to seasonal factors such as the weather affecting the level of activity as well as the availability of some fish within the seas around the coast of the UK, with the level of activity seen having a direct impact on the level of data entry work required. The information presented here concentrates on the impact of lags on the cumulative landings data for the current year. We expect these to be most significant early on in the year and reduce in terms of their impact on cumulative totals as the year progresses and earlier data become relatively stable. Year-to-date landings are the key figures used to compare the performance of the UK fishing fleet in the current year with earlier years, given the focus on annual quotas set for fish stocks that are considered as under pressure from the level of fishing activity seen. In order to better understand the effect of revisions, the [InlineAttachment:2] spreadsheet shows charts comparing the values of the cumulative 2015 year to date figures at the time they were first published with the most recent estimates published in UK Sea Fisheries Statistics 2015 for the following landings: UK vessels landing into the UK UK vessels landing abroad UK vessels landing into the UK and abroad Foreign vessels landing into the UK UK and foreign vessels landing into the UK !@2 Separate charts are shown for demersal fish, pelagic fish, shellfish and all fish species. Based on latest figures for UK vessels landing into the UK, lags in data for all fish are relatively small (see the ‘all fish’ chart in the sheet ‘1. UK land into UK’, and the data highlighted in yellow in the sheet ‘6. chart data’). For example, for 2015 data, the first estimates of cumulative landings for the year are generally around 1 per cent lower than the most recent estimates. However, lags are far more pronounced for UK vessels landing abroad and for foreign vessels landing into the UK, since it takes longer to receive a full set of complete and validated documentation. Lags are also more pronounced for demersal and shellfish species, whereas pelagic lags are very small. This is because pelagic fisheries are dominated by very large fishing vessels targeting industrial sized quantities of a small number of species (almost always landed whole) in fewer, but longer, fishing trips. Skippers and their agents are likely to operate highly organised businesses and completion of documentation will generally be to a higher standard requiring less manual intervention by data entry teams at the coast. Trips involving demersal fish and shellfish comprise a larger number of vessels, fishing a greater number of trips and catching a wider range of species in far smaller amounts. Fish can have a range of presentations and the logbooks are more likely to be problematic, and the sheer volume of these landings can give rise to backlogs. Also, most shellfish species are not subject to quota and effort management and so have a lower priority in terms of data entry. Despite this, the actual tonnage identified in lags for these demersal and shellfish trips is relatively small compared with overall landings being reported. Data revisions: Monthly figures A new ‘revisions triangle’ analysis of the change in monthly figures for the same five categories of landings can be viewed in the spreadsheet. !@1 This shows how the first reported figures (or first estimates) change as the year progresses. We will continue to update this over the coming months and revised figures for historic years will become available once data are next updated for UK Sea Fisheries Statistics in September 2017. Results show that for UK vessels landing into the UK, the total of the first estimates for 2014 and 2015 accounts for 97 per cent of the latest estimates. And for the second estimates this rises to 99 per cent. While there is some variation in the scale of revisions between individual months, we can say that we broadly expect the first month estimates to be within 3 per cent of final figures, and the second year estimates to be within 1 per cent. Because of the additional time it takes for landings abroad to be entered on our systems, we expect the first estimates of UK vessels landing into the UK and abroad to be within 6 per cent of the final figures, and the second estimates to be within 3 per cent. As with the cumulative year to date figures, relative revisions for demersal fish and shellfish for UK vessels landing abroad and for foreign vessels landing into the UK will be greater but the amounts involved are considerably smaller. Data revisions: Improving the statistics MMO is taking steps to improve the electronic data submitted by the fishing industry. The systems on board fishing vessels are supplied directly to fishermen by commercial companies under a government administered type approval scheme. Consequently, fisheries administrations do not have direct control over the design and operation of the software systems so long as they meet the minimum functionality required by EU legislation. Very little validation of data is implemented in the at-sea systems and so the quality of data depends strongly on the ability of the skipper to enter the correct information. MMO has undertaken the following actions to improve the entry of data: support to the Industry from a dedicated member of staff, who coaches skippers in the use of systems and deals with follow-up queries training of ‘super users’ in each MMO coastal office to support local skippers to improve the quality of data submitted funding the software suppliers to provide additional user training Further actions include: a redesign of MMO systems to improve efficiency of processing and to free up staff time to deal more proactively on data quality improved reporting within the business to identify and resolve data quality issues more promptly enhanced management information on the data entry and validation processes to ensure data are fit for purpose MMO is also considering making better use of unconfirmed data, i.e. data which have not gone through the full suite of checks required under EU legislation, but where the key elements within it are regarded as fit for purpose for better management of fisheries. Several operational returns produced by fisheries administrations already make use of the unconfirmed data, for example, the weekly quota uptake monitoring spreadsheets. The MMO will be exploring the possibility of including unconfirmed data within the monthly landing release to further reduce the impact of lags in reported statistics. Data reliability The measures for control on the reporting of data on fishing activity provided by EU legislation are enforced through the activity carried out by officials within each of the UK fisheries administrations to ensure compliance with these reporting requirements. Where issues are identified with the data, either with the data being reported by individual fishing vessel owners/operators or individual merchants, or where the control regime itself is thought to have weaknesses, additional activities may be carried out to strengthen or supplement the existing reporting systems. In such cases, care is taken to ensure that there is no excessive or inappropriate additional reporting burden placed on those involved in the fishing industry. Together these activities help to ensure that the data are considered fit for purpose - in terms of coverage and accuracy - as the key source of information with which officials and the industry can manage fishing activity. This includes activities such as the monitoring and management of the uptake of landings against the level of available fish quotas, and also the monitoring of activity by individual fishing vessels to ensure they comply with the limits on fishing effort as set out by various effort control regimes. The information is also widely used to support the development of new and revision of existing fisheries policies within the UK. The data are also made available within the public domain for the use of those with an interest in identifying and assessing the types and levels of fishing activity seen around the UK coast and carried out by the UK fishing fleet.

The coastal office designated as a vessel’s administration port is typically the responsible office closest in proximity to a vessel’s operational base. A vessel’s administration port may differ from its registration port. Cod Recovery Zone ( CRZ ) The Cod Recovery Zone ( CRZ ) is a group of sea areas in which restrictions exist on fishing effort by vessels 10 metres or over using certain regulated gears. The CRZ comprises four areas: Kattegat, Irish Sea ( ICES division VIIa), North Sea ( ICES division IIIa excluding Kattegat; ICES sub-area IV; EU waters of ICES division IIa; ICES division VIId) and West of Scotland ( ICES division VIa and EU waters of ICES division Vb). The regulated gears are: Beam trawls of mesh: equal to or larger than 120 mm (BT1) equal to or larger than 80 mm and less than 120 mm (BT2) Gill nets, entangling nets (GN1) Trammel nets (GT1) Longlines (LL1) Bottom trawls and seines of mesh: equal to or larger than 100 mm (TR1) equal to or larger than 70 mm and less than 100 mm (TR2) equal to or larger than 16 mm and less than 32 mm (TR3) Demersal The term demersal fish covers species living on or near the sea bed. Engine power Engine power refers to a measure of the power of a fishing vessel’s engine (in kW). Where an engine has been permanently de-rated and this has been declared to the Register of Shipping and Seamen (RSS), this is the de-rated engine power; otherwise, it is the maximum continuous engine power (MCEP) declared to the RSS. Where neither of these are available the registered engine power is used. Fishing areas Fishing areas are defined by international convention. The immediate waters around the UK are subdivided into ICES sub-areas IV (North Sea), VI (West of Scotland) and VII and its divisions the Irish Sea, VIIa; Celtic Sea, VIIg,h; Bristol Channel, VIIf; and the English Channel, VIId,e. See Appendix 3. Fishing effort Fishing effort is an aggregate measure of the activity of fishing vessels in a given sea area. It may be measured as the total time spent at sea (in hours or days), as the sum of the products of fishing capacity and time at sea for each vessel (in GT days) or as the sum of the products of engine power and time at sea for each vessel (in kW days). Fish producer organisation ( FPO ) Fish producer organisations are institutions set up in accordance with EC regulations to improve the market for their members’ catches. FPOs may also be granted responsibility by Fisheries Administrations for the management of fish quotas in addition to this function. The International Council for the Exploration of the Sea ( ICES ) The International Council for the Exploration of the Sea ( ICES ) coordinates and promotes marine research on oceanography, the marine environment, the marine ecosystem, and on living marine resources in the North Atlantic. See also: Fishing areas. Landed weight Mass (or weight) of a product at the time of landing, regardless of the state in which it has been landed. Landed fish may be whole, gutted and headed or filleted. Live weight The mass or weight of a product, when removed from the water. Pelagic The term pelagic fish covers species found mainly in shoals in midwater or near the surface of the sea. Quota A share in a total allowable catch ( TAC ) held by an EU member state. EU TACs are divided on the basis of a number of factors, including the member state’s past catch record. Shares are awarded according to a principle of ‘relative stability’, namely that each member state should enjoy a fixed percentage share of the fishing opportunities for commercial species across time. See also: Total allowable catch. Shellfish The term shellfish covers all crustaceans and molluscs. Sole Recovery Zone ( SRZ ) The Sole Recovery Zone ( SRZ ) corresponds to the Western Channel ( ICES division VIIe), in which restrictions exist on fishing effort by vessels 10 metres or over using regulated gears. In the SRZ , regulated gears are beam trawls of mesh size equal to or greater than 80mm and static nets, including gill-nets, trammel-nets and tangle-nets, with mesh size less than 220mm. Stock A stock is that part of a species population exploited in a defined fishing area. Total allowable catch ( TAC ) A total allowable catch ( TAC ) is a catch limit set by EU fisheries ministers for a particular stock. TACs are fixed on an annual basis on the basis of scientific research by national and international organisations, including ICES and the European Commission’s Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF). TACs are usually expressed in tonnes live weight. See also: Quota. Western Waters The Western Waters are a group of sea areas in which restrictions exist on fishing effort by vessels 15 metres or over on trips with certain target species. The Western Waters comprise nine areas, of which UK registered vessels are permitted to deploy effort in four: ICES sub-areas V and VI, ICES sub-area VII, ICES sub-area VIII and the Biologically Sensitive Area. Target species are demersal species (excluding those covered by Council Regulation (EEC) No 2347/2002), scallops and edible crab and spider crab. In the Biologically Sensitive Area, restrictions exist on fishing effort by vessels 10 metres or over on trips with these target species."

/government/news/future-of-uk-helicopter-search-and-rescue-agreed,"The Department for Transport has announced the signing of a £1.6 billion contract to provide the UK's search and rescue helicopter services. Future of UK helicopter search and rescue agreed  Maritime and Coastguard Agency Ministry of Defence Department for Transport The award of the contract to Bristow Helicopters Ltd was announced today by the Secretary of State for Transport, Patrick McLoughlin . UK SAR is currently provided by RAF and Royal Navy personnel using Sea King helicopters from 8 bases across the UK and through a civilian helicopter service under contract to the Maritime and Coastguard Agency ( MCA ) from 4 bases. The new service procured by the Department for Transport ( DfT ) will operate in a similar manner to the existing MCA contract and will run for 7-10 years. The contract will be managed by the MCA . The new service will operate a mixed fleet of 22 state-of-the-art helicopters from 10 locations around the UK: Sikorsky S92 helicopters will continue to be based at the existing MCA bases at Stornoway and Sumburgh, and at new bases at Newquay, Caernarfon and Humberside airports. AgustaWestland AW189 helicopters will operate from Lee on Solent, Prestwick airport, and new bases at St Athan, Inverness and Manston airports. All bases will be operational 24 hours a day. These base locations are strategically placed near areas with high SAR incident rates and will help ensure maximum operational coverage across the UK while reducing transit times to incidents. Bristow Helicopters Ltd and the MOD have agreed to a ‘managed transition’ to enable Service Personnel who wish to continue to work in UK SAR to do so without risking the current military service provision. This process is entirely voluntary and available to all ranks of military personnel in SAR roles. All decisions will be based on the manpower requirements of the RN and the RAF at the time. Those who wish to stay in the Services will be re-deployed elsewhere as part of their normal career pattern. Civilian personnel currently working for UK SAR will have the opportunity to work with Bristow Helicopters Ltd under the rules of Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) . The new UK SAR service will become operational during a phased transition during which the military SAR service will be drawn down. This will take place between spring 2015 and early 2016, and will enable current SAR Sea Kings to be retired from service. The MCA ’s 4 bases will transition to the new service in 2017. By summer 2017 the new contractor will be fully operational at all 10 bases. The bases from which the RAF and RN currently provide SAR are: RAF Boulmer; RAF Valley; RAF Lossiemouth; Royal Naval Air Station ( RNAS ) Culdrose and HMS Gannet at Prestwick. SAR also operates from Wattisham, Chivenor and Leconfield. All these bases have a wider military role and their future is not linked to this UK SAR announcement. Personnel currently involved in SAR duties have been briefed on the details of this announcement."

/guidance/shipping-industry-regulation,"How the shipping industry is regulated and how to keep up-to-date when regulations change or new regulations are introduced. Shipping industry regulation  Maritime and Coastguard Agency Introduction The shipping industry is regulated by various UN agencies - primarily the International Maritime Organization ( IMO ), which develops and maintains the framework of global maritime safety regulations. Maritime regulations also originate from EU legislation and UK legislation. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency ( MCA ) is responsible for implementing the government’s maritime safety policy in the UK on behalf of the Department for Transport (DfT) as one of its executive agencies. The MCA works closely with national and international partners in the shipping industry to promote the safe construction, operation and navigation of ships. This guide covers how the industry is regulated, the different sources of maritime regulations and how you can keep up-to-date when regulations change or new regulations are introduced. Sources of maritime regulations Regulations which govern the maritime industry come from: UK legislation EU legislation agreements, resolutions and conventions made by various UN agencies, including the International Maritime Organization ( IMO ) and International Labour Organization ( ILO ) UK legislation UK legislation is mainly made up of Acts of Parliament and statutory instruments. Acts of Parliament are the highest level of law. Acts often grant power to government ministers to create more detailed regulations called Statutory Instruments ( SIs ). Most UK legislation is in the form of SIs . Many maritime SIs have supporting documentation in the form of Marine notices (M-notices) and codes of practice. Find a directory of UK legislation on the Legislation.gov.uk website . EU legislation As a member state of the EU, the UK is subject to EU legislation. EU legislation comes in the form of: regulations directives decisions Regulations are enforceable as law within the UK as soon as they are passed in the EU and published in the European Journal. By comparison, directives and decisions must be transposed (transferred) into UK national law before they come into force. You can read an overview of EU Maritime Policy on the European Commission website . The EUR-Lex website is the official source of all EU treaties, legislation (proposed, upcoming and in force) and case-law. You can find EU legislation on the EUR-Lex website . The IMO The IMO is the UN agency that specialises in regulating the international shipping industry. It aims to provide a regulatory framework covering safety, environmental concerns, legal matters, technical co-operation, maritime security and the efficiency of shipping. The IMO has its headquarters in the UK. How it works: The IMO carries out its work in a series of meetings attended by member states. These meetings produce large amounts of documentation, such as circulars and resolutions, which IMO member states - including the UK - are encouraged to accept and implement. Find out about the work and responsibilities of the IMO on their website . You can also find IMO circulars on the IMO website and read IMO resolutions on their website . The ILO The ILO is a UN organisation that: promotes dialogue between employers and workforces worldwide campaigns for fair and decent working conditions for employees encourages employment opportunities  Maritime Labour Convention The ILO ’s MLC 2006 provides comprehensive rights and protection at work for seafarers all over the world. The MLC consolidated the existing 65 international labour standards. Find out about the MLC on the ILO website . You can also read information about the MLC on the MCA website . New, upcoming and changing maritime regulations The majority of UK maritime SIs are supported by Marine notices (referred to as M-notices) and codes of practice. These documents expand on the technical detail of the shipping and fishing legislation they support. They may be mandatory or non-mandatory, depending on whether they are given force of law by an SI . M-notices inform the shipping and fishing industries of important safety, pollution prevention and other maritime information. M-notices are issued by the MCA . There are also codes of practice that provide practical guidance on how to comply with the legislation. There are 3 types of M-notice: Merchant Shipping Notices ( MSNs ) provide mandatory guidance on legislation, and must be complied with when enforced by an SI Marine Guidance Notes ( MGNs ) provide guidance on the interpretation of the law, recommendations on best practice and general safety advice Marine Information Notes ( MINs ) are intended for a specific audience - eg equipment manufacturers - or give time-limited information - such as timetables for MCA examinations - and expire after a certain date (usually no more than 12 months after publication) M-notices also have suffixes to indicate whether the documents relate to: merchant ships (M) fishing vessels (F) merchant ships and fishing vessels (M+F) Consultations The MCA carries out public consultations on maritime issues including new legislation, proposed changes to existing legislation and guidance. You can find details of past and present consultations on the MCA website . Availability of M-notices You can obtain M-notices in three ways - as: a set of bound volumes an annual subscription individual documents You can find the latest MSNs , MGNs and MINs to buy online on the Stationery Office website . Annual subscriptions and copies of individual notices are also available from the MCA ’s official distributors - the EC Group.

Repatriation of seafarers on sea-going ships regulations  Maritime and Coastguard Agency The current provisions for repatriation are set out in the Merchant Shipping and Fishing Vessels (Repatriation) Regulations 1979. The proposed new regulations give effect to the provisions of Regulation 2.5 and Standard A2.5 of the Maritime Labour Convention 2006 ( MLC ) and will supersede the 1979 regulations for all UK sea-going merchant ships, commercially operated yachts and other commercially operated vessels. Fishermen and seafarers employed on UK vessels not subject to the MLC , which includes vessels not operating commercially, will however continue to be covered by the existing regulations. Regulation 2.5 and Standard A2.5 of the MLC revise the international requirements for the repatriation of seafarers. Generally these revised requirements are covered by existing UK legislation.

Coastguard coordinate search for person swept out to sea from Loe Bar  Maritime and Coastguard Agency Coastguards will resume the search at first light this morning (1 January 2014) for a person who went missing last night after being swept out to sea from Loe Bar, near Porthleven. The person had gone out walking with a group of friends who had decided to make for Loe Bar. The group went for a paddle in the rough seas and when some of them were up to their knees a large wave swept the person off their feet. One of the group called 999 and spoke to Falmouth Coastguard who immediately requested the following to begin a search: Coastguard Rescue Teams from Penzance, Porthleven, Mullion and Porthoustock RNLI all weather lifeboats from Penlee and Lizard rescue helicopter from RNAS Culdrose The coastguard rescue teams, lifeboats and helicopter searched for some hours in atrocious weather conditions but sadly were unable to find any sign of the missing person. By 4.30 am they had covered the search area many times over but had been unable to locate a person in the water. The search was therefore suspended until first light when the coastguard teams would begin another search. Phil Mathias, Falmouth Coastguard Watch Manager says: The weather for searching tonight has been particularly challenging and as the night has gone on, conditions have deteriorated. There have been south to south westerly gale force to severe gale force winds with very rough sea and rain. The teams have conducted a very intensive search for the missing person. We have been able to focus our efforts into a relatively tight area because of onshore winds but have still been unable to locate the missing person. We will resume our search with coastguard teams at first light today (1 January 2014). [Contact:1507]"
/government/news/rottweiler-dog-buddy-rescued-from-mud-at-langstone-harbour,"Hayling Island and Portsmouth Coastguard Rescue Teams and the Portsmouth Coastguard Sector Manager rescue a dog stuck in the mud. Rottweiler dog, ‘Buddy’ rescued from mud at Langstone Harbour  Maritime and Coastguard Agency A rottweiler dog has been rescued from mud at Langstone Harbour by the Hayling Island and Portsmouth Coastguard Rescue Teams and the Portsmouth Coastguard Sector Manager this afternoon (11 January 2014). The 8 year-old dog, Buddy, had become stuck up to his chest in mud whilst enjoying an afternoon stroll with his owner. Concerned passersby called 999 and spoke to Solent Coastguard after observing the dog’s predicament. Solent Coastguard called out the Coastguard Rescue Teams and sector manager and also requested a dog handler from Hampshire Police to attend. Steve Duff, Portsmouth Coastguard Sector Manager says: The owner was obviously very upset to see her dog’s predicament and we were concerned because the tide was starting to flood the creek. The teams had to work very quickly to get the dog out and put him in a stretcher. We managed to get Buddy extracted in the nick of time, just as the water was starting to lap at our boots. The stretcher, with Buddy and one of the team on board, was then winched to shore. Buddy was washed down, wrapped in blankets and reunited with his relieved owner who was able to take him home, cold and tired, but hopefully unharmed. If you’re out walking with your dog near cliffs or areas that you suspect might be dangerous, it’s advisable to keep your dog on a lead. However, if your pet takes an unexpected deviation and gets into difficulty at the coast, please do not attempt to rescue it yourself but call 999 immediately and ask for the Coastguard. We have specialised equipment to ensure that your dog can be rescued safely without endangering you. A photo of Buddy and his rescuers can be downloaded from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency ( MCA ) website. [Contact:1507]"

The warning comes after a number of people have taken equipment from the French fishing boat Le Sillon, which washed up on rocks at Totty Cove over the weekend. Falmouth Coastguard coordinated the rescue of the 6 crewmen on board on Saturday 1 February after Le Sillon was hit by large waves in the stormy conditions, knocking out the power and steering.

The type of material that must be reported includes any part of the hull, fixtures, fittings, cargo and any fishing equipment. If you recover an item, you have 28 days to fill out one of our report forms and submit it to us. You can find the forms on our website Those who don’t declare items are breaking the law and could find themselves facing fines of up to £2,500 and paying the owner twice the value of the item recovered. It’s expected the wreck of Le Sillon will continue to break up, due to the recent bad weather.

Canadian canoes swamped by waves on their way to Salt Island  Maritime and Coastguard Agency An overnight trip to Salt Island ended prematurely when 5 Canadian canoes were swamped by waves as they crossed Stangford Lough. At just after 12 noon a member of the public called 999 to report that 2 kayaks were in difficulty north of Green Island and there were people in the water. Belfast Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre sent the Coastguard Rescue Teams based in Portaferry and Bangor to the Lough with the RNLI Lifeboat based in Portaferry. Dive Rhib Nemo also joined the rescue. Seven canoeists from a party of 14 were pulled from the water. All 4 adults and 10 teenagers were taken to the shore by the 2 boats where they received medical attention. Jude McNeice Belfast MRCC Watch Manager said: The group were equipped with lifejackets and safety helmets but obviously weren’t expecting to spend time in the cold water.

Ensign large yacht services: advice notes on surveys  Maritime and Coastguard Agency Ensign is the Large Yacht Unit of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA). They carry out the surveys on large commercial yachts with the UK flag. This guidance is for: large yacht owners operators builders designers Carrying out surveys on non-UK or unknown flags Ensign can still carry out a survey for compliance with the large yacht codes (LYCs), even where the eventual flag is unknown, or other than British. The Red Ensign Group administration should be approached for surveys if the flag is theirs but not UK (for example Bermuda, Cayman Islands, Gibraltar, British Virgin Islands, or the Isle of Man). Documentation issued by Ensign This could be either: a charter yacht certificate a letter of compliance These may not have any official standing with other flag authorities, but they do indicate a standard of safety as required by the LYC. Advice for yacht builders When drawing up contracts that call for a charter yacht certificate, please note: some items, such as crew qualifications and ISM requirements, are beyond the builder’s control and in the hands of the owner. In such cases a Letter of Compliance should be requested. What MCA and classification (class) societies survey MCA and the classification society carry out their surveys under different parts of the LYCs. The division of responsibilities lists for LY3 and LY2 show the different LYC sections, and who is responsible for surveying them. For example, you’ll see that a large part, comprising the hull and machinery, falls to the class society. Ensign carries out the plan approval and survey for the sections assigned to MCA. An Ensign surveyor would probably visit a minimum of 3 times: once at an early stage once to witness stability tests (when construction is 98% complete) a final visit on completion This is dependent on location, and how well surveys are presented. For the sections of the code that fall to MCA, the drawing list helps in completing the survey. It’s best to submit these early in the project, to prevent any problems once construction is complete. Documents required from class societies A statement indicating that their assigned sections of the Code have been satisfactorily completed. (Ensign requires this to issue the final documentation.) an International Load Line Certificate should be issued using the relaxations permitted by the Code a certificate of commercial classification a Cargo Ship Construction Certificate (if the vessel is over 500GT) Classification societies recognised by MCA American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) Bureau Veritas (BV) Det Norske Veritas - Germanischer Lloyd (DNV GL) Lloyds Register (LR) Registro Italiano Navale (RINA) Nippon Kaiji Kyokai (NKK) The large yacht code The ‘Large Commercial Yacht Code’ was updated from LY2 to LY3 in August 2013. The full name of the original Code was the ‘Code of Practice for Safety of Large Commercial Sailing and Motor Vessels’ (now known as LY1). Ensign’s fees Ensign’s fees are £130 per hour for plan approval, survey and travel, plus expenses. They are required to take a deposit in advance, and to keep the account in credit afterwards.

He was brought ashore by the RNLI hovercraft before receiving medical attention and being taken to hospital by the North West Ambulance Service. Watch Manager Stuart Atkinson who coordinated today’s (6 April 2014) rescue said: “The winter storms have moved the sand around offshore.

Tide warning after 2 rescues in 2 hours  Maritime and Coastguard Agency The first 999 call came in just after 3pm yesterday (30 April 2014) from a member of the public who reported that two people had become cut off by the tide at Saltwick Nab, Whitby. The Whitby Coastguard Rescue Team, the Whitby RNLI lifeboat and the search and rescue helicopter from RAF Leconfield were sent to the scene. When they got there, they found two people were attempting to climb up the cliff away from the rising water. They were winched on board the helicopter and taken to the top of the cliff where they were met by Coastguard Rescue Officers. They weren’t hurt. Humber Coastguard took the second 999 call just after 4.30pm. This time, a man and a woman had become cut off by the rising tide in Wells, Norfolk. It was reported they were almost up to their necks in water and there was limited visibility due to the foggy conditions. The Wells and Cley Coastguard Rescue Teams were sent to the scene along with the Wells RNLI Inshore lifeboat. The pair were located by the lifeboat using GPS data from the couple’s mobile phone and brought safely back to shore. Mike Green, Watch Manager at Humber Coastguard, said: It appears these four people had a lucky escape. We were able to send units to their rescue quickly, and ensure they were brought back to dry land safely. We always advise people to check the weather and tidal conditions before setting out. You need to consider whether you could end up cut off by the incoming tide. Also, please don’t attempt to climb cliffs as a short cut back to the top, as you could hurt yourself in the process. If you are in trouble, or spot someone else in difficulty, call 999 and ask for the Coastguard.” [Contact:1507]"

The climbers had requested an ambulance but no further information was available. In view of the 35 metre height of the cliff, the Coastguard rescue helicopter was scrambled, Swanage RNLI Lifeboat launched and the Swanage Coastguard Rescue Team sent to the scene. When the teams arrived on scene, it was established that one of the climbers had suffered a fall and a suspected broken rib. He was therefore unable to climb back up the cliff. The Coastguard rescue helicopter, after preparing the casualty, airlifted him to the Poole Hospital landing site to be met by Poole coastguard rescue officers and ambulance for onward transportation to Poole Hospital. Swanage Lifeboat recovered their crewman who had also attended the casualty. Swanage Coastguards monitored a further three climbers until they were safely back at the top of the cliff. Portland Coastguard Watch Manager Maddy Davey, said, In this particular area, there is little or no mobile phone coverage. In areas like this it is advisable to have another means of raising the alarm, for example an additional person, not involved in the climbing activity, who could immediately inform the Coastguard of an incident.

/guidance/merchant-ships-construction-and-maintenance-standards,"Construction, radio and marine equipment standards for merchant ships and special shipping. Merchant ships: construction and maintenance standards Surveys and inspections Construction, maintenance and operation standards Maritime and Coastguard Agency Introduction The construction and operation of merchant ships is controlled by a wide range of legislation. Many of these are based on international standards agreed by member states of the International Maritime Organization ( IMO ). These IMO standards are usually agreed under European law before passing into UK legislation where amendments can be made. However, there are also other regulations related to specific vessel types. This guide discusses the construction standards for merchant ships and special shipping, as well as standards for radio, navigation and marine equipment. Merchant and special shipping construction standards The construction of UK merchant ships is controlled by the Merchant Shipping (Cargo Ship Construction) Regulations 1997. This comprehensive legislation specifies construction standards, as well as safety issues ranging from bilge pumping to the prevention of fire hazards. These construction standards form the basis on which merchant ships are surveyed and certificated. You can read more in Fishing vessels: classification, registration and inspection . There are specialist construction standards which cover the different types of merchant vessel you may have. These include a code of practice for vessels engaged in oil recovery and specialist guidance on standards for the construction and operation of special ship types and offshore support vessels. Radio and navigation equipment standards for merchant ships Radio equipment on merchant ships is subject to the Merchant Shipping (Radio Installations) Regulations 1992 and 1998. It must conform to performance standards established by the IMO . There are separate performance standards for very high-frequency radio, radio-telephones and radio telegraphy as well as for other equipment. There are also requirements under the 1992 regulations to meet the requirements of the Global Maritime Distress Safety Systems ( GMDSS ), including the provision of duplicate equipment and shore-based or on-board maintenance facilities. Merchant ships must also comply with the requirements of the IMO Safety of Life at Sea ( SOLAS ) convention. To meet these requirements guidance is available for the installation of lighting systems and other navigation equipment using the most recent technology. This ensures that vessels comply with SOLAS and the related International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea. Marine equipment standards All electrical equipment used on merchant ships must be properly maintained. You should give particular consideration to the risks associated with vibration and mechanical shock. This applies to all electrical equipment including lighting, radios, navigational systems, operational machinery and safety systems. Maintenance ensures the availability of equipment and prevents accidents from happening which result from loose connections or components. Correct maintenance - including accurate record-keeping - is an important part of the ship’s statutory survey. It is also recommended that up-to-date operating and maintenance manuals are made available on board ships and that they are provided in the working language used on the vessel.

Share hydrographic data with the MCA and help improve mariner safety MCA will pass data to the UKHO from the hydrographic surveys you perform. This will help them compile new or updated nautical charts, and so help improve safety for mariners. Your survey does not need to be carried out to full charting standards to be of use. Even without a full search for dangers, a modern survey can improve on our knowledge of the seabed. There will be no legal liability on you for the way that we use your data. Data gathering: MCA guidelines To make the bathymetry data as useful as possible, MCA recommend that you render and send it in digital form, especially data which fully complies with all aspects of International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) S44 Order 1a. Data in the following formats is welcome: Caris HDCS directory (i.e. HIPS) Generic Sensor Format or Fledermaus PFM ASCII xyz The data is also useful if: full-density digital data is supplied – before any gridding, binning or tinning is applied. (If gridded datasets have been created, you can send these to MCA ) the soundings are reduced using observed tides (not predicted tides from tide tables) depths are referenced to UKHO chart datum for the area Any spurious data must be cleaned from the final dataset you send us. Digital data with rejected soundings can be included, but must be flagged as deleted. Please state the method used in any data-cleaning (e.g. shoal or median biased). If you have it, also send MCA a report of the survey that describes how the data was gathered and processed, especially if it includes: a list of the equipment and software used how positioning equipment was set up, calibrated and used how the echo-sounder transducer was set up and levelled, together with all sensor offsets details of the horizontal datum to which the positions are referred (or the grid, if appropriate) how tides were measured how the tide pole or tide gauge was levelled how depths were reduced to chart datum Guidance for offshore developers doing hydrographic surveys Read marine guidance notice (MGN) 371 and the hydrography guidelines together.

/guidance/fishing-certification-and-training,"How to get statutory safety training and the certificates of competency you will need to work in the fishing industry. Fishing certification and training Training and certification Funding Maritime and Coastguard Agency It’s important that all fishermen understand the risks involved in fishing at sea and know what to do in an emergency. Before you go to sea as a fisherman you must take formal safety training and have certificates to prove that you have done the training. In this guide you will find information on safety training for fishermen, crew agreements, the different Certificates of Competence ( CoC ) and details about providers of fishing industry training. Safety training for boat workers and Certificates of Competence If you’re new to the fishing industry you must attend the following safety training courses: Basic sea survival Basic fire fighting and prevention Basic first aid Basic health and safety All new entrants must do the Basic Sea Survival course before going to sea for the first time. The other 3 basic safety training courses must be done within 3 months of starting work as a fisherman. If you have 2 years fishing experience you must attend the Safety Awareness and Risk Assessment course. You can find training and certification requirements for fishing vessel crew in the Maritime and Coastguard Agency ( MCA ) Marine Guidance Note ( MGN ) 411 (M+F) .

Apply for a UK CoC :fishing vessel officers Apply for a UK engineering fishing certificate Crew Agreements Certain members of your crew must sign a Crew Agreement, which is an employment contract for a specified period of time that sets out their roles and responsibilities whilst at sea. You will have to meet different crew document requirements according to the length of your fishing vessel. Fishing vessels between 55 and 80 feet If your fishing vessel is between 55 and 80 feet you must have the following crew documents: list of crew - forms ALC(FSG) 4 outer cover (Red and Blue), ALC(FSG) l(b) list of crew, ALC l(c) list of young persons official log book Preparation of documents You must complete and sign the outer cover of ALC(FSG) 4 in accordance with the headings on it (except for the bottom section), remembering to fill in the red copy as well as the blue. The list of crew form ALC(FSG) l(b)  must contain details of all those who are employed on board, in accordance with the column headings. The official log book must be maintained in accordance with Statutory Instrument No. 570 of 1981 that requires: the outer cover and pages 2 and 3 are completed in accordance with the various headings at the time of opening the crew agreement the instructions on births and deaths on pages 4 and 5 are followed closely, especially with regard to the Return of Death on form RBDl all crew member illness and injury on board the vessel is carefully recorded in the top half of pages 6 and 7 and also on form WRIK and then forwarded to the nearest Marine Office immediately when the vessel returns to port all casualties are recorded in the lower half of pages 6 and 7 and also reported in part IV of form WRIK and forwarded to the nearest Marine Office immediately all musters, including boat drills, training and inspections of fire and life saving appliances are recorded on Page 8 the narrative section on pages 9-12 to contain a record of every crew member who is discharged from the vessel, as well as any occurrence not otherwise recorded Disposal of documents: list of crew The blue copy of a document is the ship’s duplicate and must be present on the vessel each time she goes to sea. If you are a vessel owner, you must maintain a copy of the crew list ashore. The master of a vessel should - as soon as possible and within three days - notify the owner of any changes made in the list of crew members. The red copy of the crew list must be delivered to the Marine Office within two days of being drawn up. The list of crew remains active for six months from the date the first name is entered. It must be closed at the end of that period, or, if the vessel is then at sea, upon the first return to port within 30 days after that time. It must, in normal circumstances, be delivered to a Marine Office within two days of closing. Disposal of documents: official log book When a vessel is at sea, the official log book must be kept on board at all times. The log book remains in force for the same period as the list of crew and should be delivered to the Marine Office at the same time, in normal circumstances, within two days of closing. If a radio log book is required, it should be delivered at the same time. Reminders: list of crew If you are a master of a vessel it is your responsibility to complete and maintain the list of crew, except the copy kept ashore. You must also deliver the Red copy to the Marine Office. When the list of crew is closed, you must complete the details required on the cover and ensure that it is properly completed to show dates and places of discharge, signatures, etc. Reminders: official log books For any vessel of 40 feet (12 metres) or more in length, but less than 80 feet (24.4 metres), the master must ensure that the crew are properly trained in the use and location of all life-saving and fire appliances and equipment and such training must be carried out once a month. The lifesaving equipment and fire appliances must also be inspected once a month. If there is a failure to conduct any muster, drill, inspection or training session, you must write an explanatory entry in the official log book (page 8). There are therefore no circumstances in which the columns in page 8 of the log book should be left blank. Fishing vessels over 80 feet in length The main difference with a fishing vessel over 80 feet in length is the number of documents that you must maintain in the Crew Agreements and list of crew. You will usually require the following documents on board: outer cover (Red and Blue) agreement - incorporating list of crew list of exempt persons - often not necessary list of young persons on board contractual clauses provisions and water crew copy Download Merchant Shipping Notice ( MSN ) 1314 (PDF, 14KB) Guide to the fishing industry on documents required by law to be maintained from the MCA website. For all types of fishing vessel The list of crew Blue copy is the ship’s copy and must be on the vessel each time she goes to sea. A copy of this list should be maintained by the owner ashore. The list of crew Red copy must be delivered to the Marine Office within two days of being made up. It is the master’s responsibility to complete and maintain the list of crew and to deliver the Red copy to the Marine Office. A master must complete the details required on the cover when the book is closed. The official log book must be kept on board at all times and remains in force for the same period as the list of crew. If you fail to conduct any muster, drill, inspection or training session, you must write an explanatory entry in the official log book (page 8). Breach of Crew Agreements If a seafarer’s breach of Crew Agreement leads to expenses or losses to the vessel or business, they can be deducted a set amount of wages. The maximum wage deductions are as follows: unauthorised absence - £100 breach of duties under the Crew Agreement - £300 breach of duties under a fishing vessel Crew Agreements - £200 Fishing training providers You can access training necessary for the fishing industry via a Sea Fish Industry Authority (Seafish) approved and supported network of training providers.

/guidance/medical-certificates-maritime-security-guards,"Guidance for maritime security guards and their employers about the medical certificates needed for working at sea.  Medical certificates: maritime security guards Training and certification Maritime safety Maritime and Coastguard Agency Overview Maritime security guards are also known as private maritime security contractors (PMSCs), armed guards, or security personnel. This guidance for maritime security guards, and their employers, outlines the medical fitness certificate requirements specific to them. Medical certificates If your normal place of work is on a UK flag vessel, then you are classed as a ‘seafarer’ and you need an ENG1 certificate or equivalent . Read ‘Seafarers: medical certification guidance’ . Maritime security guards who fail ENG1 colour vision tests If you fail an Isihara test, you’ll get your ENG1, but it will be restricted: ‘No navigational lookout duties’ If you pass a lantern test at one of four centres in the UK, the restriction can be removed. This is providing there are no other medical conditions that may affect your fitness to work at sea. Employers of maritime security guards: medical certification guidance Because a maritime security guard is classed as a ‘seafarer’, they must have the minimum appropriate medical fitness certificate: an ENG 1 or equivalent. An ENG 1 is an assessment of a person’s fitness to work at sea. It doesn’t assess their mental health, or how suitable they are to carry a firearm. If you want your security guards to have additional fitness, mental health or firearm testing: get legal advice on the competence level a doctor needs to assess them on get them tested with another doctor Please note: The approved doctor might be happy to carry out the additional testing, but this is at their discretion because it falls outside of the ENG1 requirements. Discuss this with MCA before the appointment is booked. Further guidance for employers The Department for Transport (DfT) has issued a code of practice that details the best way to assess a maritime security guard’s fitness. !@1"

It was recognised for the USCG’s Qualship 21 for 2014-15, thanks to an excellent Port State Control record achieved by UK-flagged vessels. Qualship 21 assesses ships’ safety and pollution prevention records and is awarded against a stringent set of criteria, including the requirement for a less-than 1 per cent detention ratio over a rolling thee-year average. The award reduces the likelihood that UK-registered ships will be proactively targeted for future inspection by US Port State Control inspectors. Head of the UK Ship Register, Debasis Mazumdar, said: The Maritime and Coastguard Agency is delighted to have kept Qualship 21 for the UK Ship Register. The UK Ship Register team works closely with our customers to maintain excellent Port State Control records for ships registered under the UK flag; this success is due in large part to the high standard of service delivered by the MCA’s surveyors and the high quality of ships registered with us.

/guidance/large-yachts-construction-and-maintenance-standards,"Large Commercial Yacht Code requirements for the construction, maintenance and operation, and responsibilities for surveying and certifying of large commercial yachts.  Large yachts: construction and maintenance standards  Maritime and Coastguard Agency Introduction There are different requirements for the classification, certification and survey of vessels, which must be adhered to. The requirements for the construction, maintenance and operation of all large commercial yachts are provided by the Large Commercial Yacht Code ( LY2 ). Large commercial yachts are defined as vessels that: are in commercial use for sport or pleasure are 24 metres and over in load line length, or if built before 21 July 1968, 150 gross tonnes (gt) or over carry no cargo carry no more than 12 passengers LY2 only applies to large commercial yachts which are less than 3,000gt. This guide explains how LY2 sets standards for the construction, equipment carriage requirements, operation and examination of large commercial yachts. It also sets out Ensign’s (the MCA ’s Large Yacht Services) responsibilities for surveying and certifying large yachts under the Code. The Large Commercial Yacht Code LY2 was developed to establish standards of safety and pollution prevention appropriate to the size and use of these vessels. In general, these standards are set by international conventions or equivalent standards. LY2 is regularly reviewed and revised to take into account technical developments and the needs of the industry - the most recent revision was in 2007. The Code has the force of law in the UK.

/guidance/control-and-management-of-ballast-water,"How to manage ballast water in shipping including exchange and treatment, plans and systems, and management requirements for specific regions. Control and management of ballast water Pollution prevention Maritime and Coastguard Agency Introduction Loading and discharge of ballast water is an essential part of a ship’s operation, and is fundamental to maintaining safe operations under different conditions of load. However, large vessels require thousands of tonnes of water to ensure stability and manoeuvrability, and the environmental impacts of this can be considerable. These impacts result from the fact that the ballast water can contain hundreds of different species, many of which can have serious ecological, economic and public health effects if transferred to regions where they are not native. The recognition of these effects has made ballast management increasingly important for protection of the marine environment. This guide explains the need to control and manage ballast water. It also includes information on ballast water exchange and treatment, ballast water management plans and systems, and management requirements for specific regions. Control and manage ballast water and sediments The ballast water that ships require to maintain stability and ensure manoeuvrability contains microscopic organisms. Most will not survive the voyage, but those which do may establish themselves in a new environment. As non-native species these can have a severe impact on local ecology, economy and public health. The International Maritime Organization ( IMO ) has developed a Convention aimed at preventing these harmful effects, adopting the International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships’ Ballast Water and Sediments (the Ballast Water Management Convention) in 2004. This convention provides a structure to address the issues of ballast water and provides two performance standards for the discharge of ballast water - D1 and D2. The D1 standard is for ballast water exchange, and specifies the volume of water to be replaced. The D2 standard covers approved ballast water treatment systems, and specifies levels of viable organisms left in water after treatment. The Convention will come into force at different times, depending on ballast-tank capacity and date of vessel construction. At the present time, the Convention is not in force. Other guidelines issued in relation to the Convention include procedures for: ships to carry a ballast water management plan recording and reporting of ballast management minimising uptake of organisms, removing of sediment and avoiding unnecessary discharge Guidelines for ballast water exchange Ballast water exchange involves replacing water taken in port or near the coast at the start of a voyage with water taken up from open ocean areas. This reduces the risk of introducing species as deep ocean water tends to contain fewer organisms and these generally have more difficulty surviving in coastal and port environments when discharged. The D1 standard developed by the IMO , as part of the Ballast Water Management Convention, specifies that you must replace at least 95 per cent of the water. If the exchange involves pump-through of ballast tanks, at least three times the volume should be pumped through each tank. As safe and effective ballast water exchange at sea depends on weather and sea conditions, an exchange may not always be possible. In addition, there is likely to be a residue of organisms in the water, and these can still cause issues if you discharge closer to land - particularly if tanks are allowed to extensively silt up. At no time when undertaking ballast water exchange should the stability of the vessel be impaired. Guidelines for ballast water treatment Ballast-water exchange at sea is not considered an ideal method of ballast-water management, and considerable efforts are being made to develop treatment methods. These methods must be in accordance with Standard D-2 of the IMO ’s Ballast Water Management Convention. Standard D2 specifies that treated and discharged ballast water must have: fewer than ten viable organisms greater than or equal to 50 micrometers in minimum dimension per cubic metre fewer than ten viable organisms less than 50 micrometres in minimum dimension and greater than or equal to 10 micrometers in minimum dimension per millilitre In addition, Standard D2 specifies that your discharge of the indicator microbes shall not exceed specified concentrations as follows: toxicogenic vibrio cholerae (O1 and O139) with less than one colony-forming unit (cfu) per 100 millilitres or less than 1 cfu per 1 gram (wet weight) zooplankton samples escherichia coli less than 250 cfu per 100 millilitres intestinal enterococci less than 100 cfu per 100 millilitres These are the indicator microbes, as a human health standard, but they are not limited to these types. Options being considered for ballast-water treatment include: mechanical filtration and separation treatment methods such as sterilisation chemical treatment a combination of these methods Research is still being conducted into these methods, although it is agreed that any treatment must be safe, environmentally acceptable, cost-effective and must work. Create a ballast water management plan The IMO has developed guidelines for control and management of ships’ ballast water, which operate alongside the international Ballast Water Management Convention. Although compliance with the guidelines is not legally required at this time, UK-registered ships are encouraged to follow them. Your ships should carry and implement a ballast water management plan, detailing safety procedures for your ship and crew. The plan must provide a detailed description of the actions to be taken to implement the ballast water management requirements. The ballast water management plan must be approved by a recognised Classification Society, and must include safety procedures for the ship and crew. It must also have a detailed description of actions to be taken to implement the ballast water management requirements. Your ships should also carry a Ballast Water Record Book, which must be completed after each ballast water operation. Ballast water management plans are required for ships taking on or discharging ballast water in some ocean sectors. Ballast water management requirements in specific areas In addition to the IMO ’s Ballast Water Management Convention, specific areas of the oceans have additional requirements for ballast water control, which you must adhere to. Antarctic waters There are specific requirements for the uptake or discharge of ballast water in Arctic or Antarctic waters. You must follow these unless the safety of the ship is jeopardised by a ballast exchange, or where it is necessary for saving life at sea. A ballast water management plan is to be prepared for vessels entering Antarctic waters, taking into account problems of ballast water exchange in Antarctic conditions. Your vessels should keep a record of ballast water operations. Ballast water should first be exchanged before arrival in Antarctic waters or at least 50 nautical miles from the nearest land in waters at least 200 metres deep. Similarly, ballast water taken on in Antarctic waters should be exchanged north of the Antarctic Polar Frontal Zone, and at least 200 nautical miles from the nearest land in water at least 200 metres deep. The release of sediments during the cleaning of ballast tanks should not take place in Antarctic waters. Vessels that have spent significant time in the Arctic should discharge and clean tanks before entering Antarctic waters. If this is not possible, sediment accumulation in ballast tanks should be monitored and sediment disposed of in accordance with the ship’s ballast water management plan. Washington State waters Some United States territorial waters also have regulations controlling ballast water management. If your commercial vessel is over 300 gross tonnes it is not permitted to discharge ballast water in Washington State waters without previously having undergone open ocean exchange or some approved form of treatment. Brazilian waters Vessels entering Brazilian waters must carry a ballast water management plan.

/guidance/prevent-pollution-and-reduce-harmful-emissions-at-sea,"How the maritime industry should treat waste at sea and in ports, reduce oil and air pollution, and control ozone-depleting substances. Prevent pollution and reduce harmful emissions at sea Pollution prevention Maritime and Coastguard Agency Introduction It is generally recognised that all businesses have a major role to play in preventing pollution and reducing releases of harmful emissions into the environment and this is particularly true of the shipping industry. The impact of pollution on fragile ecosystems is particularly severe in the marine environment, and to address this there is a substantial body of UK, European Union ( EU ) and wider international regulations related to environmental control, including comprehensive survey and certification requirements. General requirements for pollution prevention in the marine environment Most international regulations on marine pollution come from the 1973 International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships ( MARPOL ), which was updated in 1978. MARPOL was developed by the International Maritime Organization ( IMO ) and is aimed at preventing and minimizing pollution from ships - both accidental and from routine operations. There have been a number of amendments to the Convention since it was first produced, and MARPOL now has six technical annexes covering marine pollution by: oil noxious liquid substances carried in bulk harmful substances carried in packaged form sewage from ships garbage from ships air pollution from ships Survey and certification requirements for pollution prevention in the marine environment The specific requirements for survey and certification of ships will depend upon the specific pollution prevention issue being considered. Some ships may only require a single survey at construction, while for others a renewal may be required every five years with additional mid-term surveys. For more information on the regime for air emissions (including the requirements for engine NOx survey) see the section of this guide about air pollution and ozone-depleting substances. Anti-fouling systems ( AFS ) are also the subject of the periodic survey regime. See the next section in this guide for further information. For more information, see the guides on Vessel classification and certification and vessel survey and inspection requirements . Guidance on use of anti-fouling systems Organotin compounds found in many AFS have been shown to have adverse effects on the ecology and on marine organisms. Their use is now prohibited in AFS for all ships, irrespective of size, and on fixed or floating platforms. Ships longer than 24 metres but less than 400 gross tonnes must carry a Declaration, with supporting documentation, showing that the AFS used on the ship complies with the regulations. Ships of more than 400 gross tonnes must be surveyed on first use of an AFS , or when it is changed or substantially replaced. The ship’s Certificate must be endorsed accordingly. Ships with no AFS which trade internationally must carry either a Declaration or Certificate stating specifically that no AFS has been used. The sale and marketing of anti-fouling paints for marine use containing organotin compounds is prohibited within the UK and other EU states. You can download Marine Guidance Note ( MGN ) 398 (M+F) Merchant Shipping (Anti-Fouling Systems) Regulations 2009 Prevention of marine pollution by garbage and sewage The disposal of garbage and sewage from ships is a major environmental issue, and Annexes IV and V of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships were developed to address this. Within the UK, Merchant Shipping (Prevention of Pollution by Garbage) Regulations 1998 were developed to address this and were updated in 2008 to reflect changes made to the system internationally. You can [download MGN 385 (M+F) Guidance on the Merchant Shipping (Prevention of Pollution by Sewage and Garbage from Ships) Regulations 2008(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mgn-385-prevention-of-pollution-by-sewage-and-garbage-from-ships-regulations-2008) Under these Regulations: every ship of 12 metres or more must display placards informing crew and passengers about disposal requirements for garbage every ship of 400 gross tonnes or certificated for 15 passengers or more must have a garbage management plan and maintain a garbage record book The Regulations also specify that vessels covered by the regulations must have at least one of the following: a sewage treatment plant which complies with the Merchant Shipping (Marine Equipment) Regulations 1999 a sewage comminuting and disinfecting system, with facilities for temporary storage of sewage a holding tank for the retention of sewage which has sufficient capacity and has a visual indicator of the amount of its contents Sewage that has been treated can be discharged anywhere at sea. Sewage that has been comminuted and disinfected can be discharged a minimum of three miles from the nearest land. Untreated sewage must be discharged no less than 12 nautical miles from the nearest land. In all the above cases the vessel must be proceeding at not less than 4 knots when making the discharge. Other ships can opt into the provisions of the regulations and for smaller vessels guidance is provided by the Small Commercial Vessel and Pilot Boat Code of Practice. You can download MGN 280 (M) Small Vessels in Commercial Use for Sport or Pleasure, Workboats and Pilot Boats - Alternative Construction Standards Port waste management planning Port waste management is regulated by the Merchant Shipping and Fishing Vessels (Port Waste Reception Facilities) Regulations 2008, which includes requirements for vessels to: notify the port before arrival of waste onboard and the amounts to be offloaded offload all ship-generated wastes to port/terminal reception facilities, unless they have notified that they will be retaining wastes on board pay for the use of waste discharge facilities In turn, harbour and terminal operators must provide adequate waste reception facilities, and must have in place a port waste management plan. Although fishing vessels are exempt from notifying ports of their waste, and of paying a mandatory charge, they must land waste into the facilities provided by the port or directly to a waste contractor through a private contract. Smaller vessels not governed by this regime are expected to dispose of their waste in an environmentally sound manner. Vessels must make sure that waste from exhaust gas cleaning systems equipment is handled carefully and not discharged into ports, harbours or estuaries unless it is thoroughly documented that the waste streams will have no adverse impact on its ecosystem. Air pollution and ozone-depleting substances Air pollution from ships, and in particular the emission of sulphur and nitrogen compounds ( SOx and NOx ) and ozone-depleting substances ( ODS ) is strictly controlled by regulations that implement the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships ( MARPOL ) and its various annexes and protocols. MARPOL Annex VI, which is specifically about air pollution, has 19 separate regulations, as well as a Code for controlling nitrogen oxide emissions. Annex VI is implemented in UK law through the Merchant Shipping (Prevention of Air Pollution from Ships) Regulations 2008 (as amended). Volatile Organic Compounds ( VOCs ) Control of VOCs at tanker terminals is left to individual terminals to reflect the variation in VOC impacts found between terminals. A port wishing to manage VOCs must contact the MCA and indicate: the size of tankers to be controlled the cargoes requiring vapour emission control systems the vapour emission control system to be employed operational practices the date the harbour or terminal would like the controls to start The application must be submitted at least 18 months before the date that the harbour or terminal has applied for the VOC to be regulated. Ozone-depleting substances The use of virgin hydro-fluorocarbons ( HCFCs ) is prohibited for maintenance and servicing from 1 January 2010 and for all HCFCs for maintenance and servicing from 1 January 2015. After 1 January 2015 HCFCs can continue to be used in existing installations provided that no maintenance or servicing takes place. The use of ODS is not prohibited in systems and equipment installed before 19 May 2005. Sulphur control Masters are required to record evidence of the changeover to low sulphur fuel in order to demonstrate compliance having entered a Sulphur Emission Control Area. Sampling Masters of all ships subject to Annex VI must: keep records of fuel oil delivered to and used on the ship, with detailed information, on a bunker delivery note take and keep a sample of the fuel oil, signed by the supplier and the officer in charge of bunkering Delivery notes must be kept on board for at least three years. The sample must be retained under the ship’s control until the fuel oil is used, or 12 months, whichever is longer. Local suppliers of fuel oil for combustion purposes, delivered to and used on board ships, must register with the MCA . Guidance on oil pollution and fuel oil sampling The main international body of regulations to prevent pollution from ships is MARPOL . For more information, see the section of this guide on general requirements for pollution prevention in the marine environment. Annex I of the Convention, which is specifically aimed at preventing oil pollution, was subsequently supplemented by a separate IMO Convention on oil pollution preparedness, response and co-operation. These Conventions have led to the development by the IMO of a manual on oil pollution, which provides practical information on preventing pollution and dealing with incidents. The Manual can be bought from the IMO publications department. To order, call the IMO helpline on 020 7735 7611 or email sales@imo.org . Oil Record Books Every ship of 400 gross tonnes and above, other than an oil tanker, and every oil tanker of 150 gross tonnes and above, must keep and complete an Oil Record Book. It must be completed whenever any of the following operations take place in the ship: ballasting or cleaning of oil fuel tanks discharging ballast or cleaning water from oil fuel tanks disposing oily residues (sludge) discharging overboard bilge water which has accumulated in machinery spaces Oil tankers will need to record extra operations including loading, unloading and transferring oil cargo. Constructional requirements There are detailed construction requirements for new ships within the MARPOL annex which are particularly relevant to oil tankers but impact on other vessels as well. Pollution prevention for fishing and inland waterway vessels The cumulative effect of relatively small-scale pollution from garbage, bilge washing and catering waste causes a range of problems, as does lost fishing gear. Some of this material does not degrade easily, and can cause injuries to marine life, as well as propeller fouling and intake blockages. To prevent these problems, operators of fishing vessels should: have onboard procedures that minimise the accidental loss of fishing gear at sea bring garbage and debris ashore for disposal become involved in the port’s waste management plan and in particular raise any inadequacies with the port authorities Inland waterways Inland waters in the UK are categorised into one of four groups. In outline, these are: narrow rivers and canals with a general depth of less than 1.5 metres wider rivers and canals with a general depth of over 1.5m, and significant wave heights of less than 0.6 metres tidal rivers and estuaries and large lakes with significant wave heights of less than 1.2 metres tidal rivers and estuaries with significant wave heights of less than 2.0 metres Operators of vessels in these waters should comply with local bylaws relating to the discharge of waste water and dispose of rubbish at suitable shore facilities. Sanitation systems capable of discharging sewage must not be fitted unless they can be sealed or rendered inoperable. Sealed sanitation systems must be in accordance with the BS MA101:1986 Specification for toilet retention and re-circulation systems for the treatment of toilet waste. Oil-tight trays must be fitted under every engine and gearbox to prevent oil leaks. No fixed bilge pump should draw from an oil-tight area.

/guidance/vessel-classification-and-certification,"Class and permitted use of passenger ships, cargo ships, tankers, tugs, tenders, fishing boats, yachts, commercial vessels, and the required certificates. Vessel classification and certification Surveys and inspections Ship registration Maritime and Coastguard Agency Introduction All seagoing vessels registered in the UK are assigned to a specific class, which defines their type of permitted use, determines which certification they must hold and specifies the inspection and survey regime required to comply with this certification. These classes are established and assigned by the Recognised Classification Societies, who also approve surveys and inspections. This guide explains the main classes of UK-registered seagoing vessels, and gives outline details of the statutory certificates they must carry.

/government/news/kayakers-rescued-off-devon-coast,"Three kayakers were rescued on Saturday 8 miles off the Devon coast. Kayakers Rescued Off Devon Coast  Maritime and Coastguard Agency At 8.25am on Saturday 21 June 2014 Swansea Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre received a mobile phone call from 3 kayakers who reported they had got into difficulties after the double kayak had capsized during a 22 mile paddle from Ilfracombe to Lundy Island. The mobile phone signal from the caller was weak and dropped out at times due to the kayakers being far offshore but Coastguard coordinators were able to get an approximate position of the incident. Swansea Coastguard asked Appledore and Clovelly RNLI lifeboats to head to the location 8 miles off the coast and while lifeboats were heading to the scene Swansea Coastguard was contacted by the container vessel Endeavor, which spotted the kayakers. The vessel stood by until the Clovelly inshore lifeboat arrived and recovered the 3 men and then rendezvoused with the Appledore all weather lifeboat. The men were taken back to shore by Appledore RNLI lifeboat and were assessed by paramedics for hypothermia but fortunately did not need further medical attention. Coastguard advice for kayakers in general is to always wear a buoyancy aid, check weather and tides, keep within your limits. Make sure you have a good range of communications on board if you need to raise the alarm because mobile phone and handheld VHF coverage can be limited when offshore. Carry flares, a PLB (personal locator beacon) and a GPS (Global Positioning System). [Contact:1507]"
/government/news/falmouth-maritime-rescue-coordination-centre-help-yacht-off-seychelles,"Falmouth Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre is currently involved in a search and rescue operation in the Indian Ocean. Falmouth Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre help yacht off Seychelles  Maritime and Coastguard Agency At 0830 this morning Falmouth Maritime Rescue Co-ordination Centre (MRCC) received an emergency positioning beacon alert (EPIRB) from a 45ft yacht with 3 people on board, including a British national, around 300 miles south of the Seychelles. The vessel has suffered severe damage to its main rudder and is taking on water. The crew is using pumps to limit the amount of water taken onboard. Falmouth MRCC has asked a Maersk tanker in the region to divert to the yacht. The tanker is expected to arrive at around 1930 UK time. The seas are rough to very rough with wind speeds in excess of 25 knots. Falmouth has alerted search and rescue authorities in the area including the Seychelles Coastguard. Falmouth Coastguard Watch Manager, Martin Bidmead, said: The yacht’s remote location presents a number of challenges and the Falmouth MRCC has alerted the Seychelles Coastguard and other vessels in the region to get the search and rescue operation under way and assist the crew of this yacht as quickly as possible. We continue to be in touch with the vessel providing advice and updates."

Download MSN 1770 (F) The Code of Safe Working Practice for the Construction and Use of 15-24 Metre Fishing Vessels . Fishing vessels of 24 metres and over in length are covered by the 1975 Fishing Vessel (Safety Provisions) Rules, as amended, and the Fishing Vessels (EC Directive on Harmonised Safety Regime Directive) Regulations 1999. In general, all fishing vessels must be surveyed before entering service to make sure that they comply with the appropriate certification requirements. Vessels less than 15 metres in length must be built to Seafish construction standards, surveyed against these standards by Seafish and then inspected by the MCA prior to registration as a fishing vessel. These vessels must then be inspected by the MCA every five years to continue working. The owner of the vessel, or their representative, is also required to self-certify annually. Vessels of 15 metres in length to less than 24 metres must also be built to, and surveyed against, Seafish Construction Standards and then surveyed by the MCA before registration. These vessels must have a full renewal survey every five years with a mid-term inspection to maintain the UKFVC . The owner of the vessel, or their representative, also needs to self-certify annually. Vessels of 24 metres in length and over must be built to Classification Society Standards and surveyed by the relevant society to make sure it meets those standards. It must then be surveyed by the MCA prior to registration. The IFVC lasts four years and in that time they must be surveyed annually by the Classification Society, have an intermediate survey by the MCA after two years, and have full renewal survey after four years.  The MCA provides guidance for owners of small fishing vessels on preparing for surveys. Download a survey preparation guide for vessels up to 15 metres from the MCA website (PDF, 510K) . Fishing vessel inspection and survey requirements and procedures The MCA surveys all UK commercial fishing vessels above 15 metres in overall length in order to make sure they comply with legal safety requirements. Once your vessel has passed the survey, it will be provided with the relevant safety certificate. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, this certificate is the IFVC . For this to remain in force you need to make sure that there is: an annual survey of the vessel - by a classification society if the vessel is classed an annual survey of the vessel - by the MCA to the standards of a classification society if the vessel is not classed an intermediate survey three months either side of the second anniversary of the certificate For vessels of 15 metres in length to less than 24 metres, the required certificate is the United Kingdom Fishing Vessel Certificate. To remain in force the vessel needs to have an inspection between 24 and 36 months after the certificate is issued. Commercial fishing vessels under 15 metres in length require inspections instead of surveys. If the vessel passes the inspection, it will be awarded the Small Fishing Vessel Certificate ( SFVC ) (Merchant Service Fee ( MSF ) 1316). All commercial fishing vessels need the appropriate Fishing Vessel Certificate before they can go to sea. Survey requirements for fishing vessels 15-24 metres in length For commercial fishing vessels 15-24 metres in length, the survey requirements cover safety standards set out in MSN 1770 Code of Safe Working Practice for the Construction & Use of 15 metres LOA to Less than 24 metres RL Fishing Vessels. Download a survey/inspection checklist for fishing vessels of 15-24 metres .

Fishing vessel construction survey procedure For fishing vessels of 15 metres in length and above the procedure involves: applying using form MSF 5100 together with your fee deposit submitting of plans to the MCA surveyor for approval visits - the MCA surveyor will visit your yard during construction, and they will work with Seafish surveyors or class surveyors to make sure the relevant Code of Safe Working Practice and the Seafish certificate of construction (for vessels 15-24 metres in length) is complied with final visit - when the MCA surveyor carries out stability and operational tests and a general inspection of staffing levels, qualifications, health and safety procedures,  and whether crew are familiar with all the equipment and emergency drills etc sea trials - discretionary attendance When the MCA surveyor visits, they will need external and internal access to all areas of the vessel. They will only allow exemptions from the survey standards if they can see that equivalent materials or systems are in place. Renewal surveys usually need two visits from the surveyor, one out of water and one afloat, to carry out operational and stability tests. If the surveyor isn’t satisfied with the survey, they will provide a list of defects and may return later to check that they have been resolved. The MCA surveyor may also decide to detain the vessel. If the vessel passes the survey, the MCA will issue the relevant United Kingdom Fishing Vessel Certificate ( UKFVC ), which covers a specific period. In order to make sure the certificate is still valid during this period, the MCA or Classification Society will carry out intermediate inspections or annual and intermediate surveys, dependent on the size of the vessel. Vessels of 15-24 metres in length are also required to conduct annual self certifications. Risk assessments All fishing vessels require risk assessments. For further information see the health and safety at sea section on the MCA website . Fishing vessel documents To pass a survey, vessels must carry the relevant documents. For example: all fishing vessels over 16.8 metres (55 feet) - an official log-book all fishing vessels over 24.4 metres (80 feet) - a crew agreement, posted on ship with a copy kept at an address within the UK all fishing vessels over 12.2 metres (40 feet) - a list of crew, with a copy kept at an address within the UK MSN relevant to fishing vessels You can find further guidance on documents to be held by vessels of 16.8 metres to less than 24.4 metres in length in MSN M.1303.

Enforcement measures If your vessel contravenes the relevant Code or conditions for exemptions, you will face a fine or imprisonment if convicted. Flag-in fishing vessels surveys You can find information on the flag-in process for fishing vessels on the MCA website . Inspection of fishing vessels under 15 metres in length Fishing vessels under 15 metres in length require inspections instead of surveys. From 2011, the MCA will introduce a new Small Fishing Vessel Code that requires fishing vessels under 15 metres in length to have a SFVC ( MSF 1316). These certificates have been issued from July 2010. Inspections are carried out by MCA surveyors or inspectors to make sure that fishing vessels which are less than 15 metres in length meet the requirements of MSN 1813, the Code of Practice for the Safety of Small Fishing Vessels. Inspections are free of charge. To pass the inspection, your fishing vessel must meet a range of safety requirements and carry the following documents: a list of crew on all fishing vessels over 12.2 metres (40 ft) in length, with a copy kept at an address within the UK MSNs relevant to fishing vessels Download MSN 1813 Code of Practice for Small Fishing Vessels 2007 . You can also find information in annex 1 of the Under 15m LOA Fishing Vessel Inspection Regime Instructions for the Guidance of Inspectors on the MCA website . How to prepare for a vessel survey Fishing vessels 15 metres in LOA and over that are registered in the UK must have a UKFVC or an IFVC . A vessel can be surveyed to make sure it meets safety standards up to six months before its existing certificate expires. The survey can be completed in two visits - although additional visits may be necessary depending on the surveyors’ findings. You should have all your records and certification ready for inspection before the survey begins. The two main elements of a fishing vessel inspection are: an ‘out of water’ survey an ‘afloat’ survey, including stability checks Out of water survey You can prepare your fishing vessel for an ‘out of water’ survey by: pressure washing the hull carrying out ultra-sonic tests on the total hull area and any suspect areas on steel vessels removing and cleaning sea valves, - inlets and overboard checking draft marks checking propeller shaft clearances by lifting the shaft and using a clock gauge or feeler gauges checking the propeller hub condition and operation - eg if it’s a controlled pitch propeller recording rudder pintle bearing clearances ensuring safe access for the surveyor to all areas of vessel having a shipwright present during the survey visit to discuss any action needed with the surveyor if the vessel is wooden Afloat survey An afloat survey will include: a lightship check an inclining or roll test a stability assessment Radio survey A radio survey should also be booked as part of the overall survey. It must be carried out before a UKFVC or IFVC can be issued to the vessel owner. The MCA provides a list of organisations authorised to survey radio installations on fishing vessels. Download contact information for authorised surveyors of radio installations on passenger ships, fishing vessels and unclassed cargo vessels . On board survey During an on board survey of a fishing vessel, the surveyor will check areas such as the: wheelhouse wheelhouse top casing top shelter top accommodation main deck fish room engine room equipment tests vessel operations and drills Except for remote winch stops, fishing gear is not tested during a UKFVC or IFVC inspection. Fishing gear Fishing gear is tested independently of UKFVC / IFVC certification under the regulations: Provision and Use of Work Equipment - Marine Guidance Note ( MGN ) 331 (M+F) - non-lifting equipment on fishing vessels Guide to Lifting Operations and Lifting Equipment Regulations - MGN 332 (M+F) - lifting equipment on fishing vessels For further information on fishing gear testing see the guide on fishing safety, health and safe working practices . Booking a fishing vessel survey You can book a fishing vessel survey by contacting your nearest MCA fishing survey office - find local fishing survey office contact details . Download fishing vessel survey preparation guidance from the MCA website (PDF, 511K) . Registering fishing vessels A fishing vessel is a boat used to catch sea fish for profit, even if it is only used occasionally. Every British sea fishing vessel - with certain exceptions - that fishes for profit must be registered by law. All fishing vessels that catch sea fish for profit must also have a licence issued by the appropriate Fisheries Department. You should contact your Local Fisheries Office about licensing at the same time as applying for registration. You can get full or simple registration for a fishing vessel. Full registration requires: proof of ownership, including Bills of Sale builders certificate for new vessels forms MSF 4740, MSF 4728 including a declaration of the maximum continuous engine power ( MCEP ), MSF 4705 and MSF 4743 A vessel with full registration can have mortgages registered against it. Simple registration requires: an accepted receipted invoice forms MSF 4740, MSF 4728, including a declaration of the MCEP Mortgages cannot be recorded against a vessel with simple registration. How to Register You will need to complete a British ship form and submit it with the appropriate fees and support documentation, eg: a copy of certificate of incorporation - if the owner is a body corporate safety certificate - for vessels over 15 metres International Tonnage Certificate (ITC69) - if the vessel is over 15 metres Seafish Certificate Find form MSF 4740 Application to Register a British Ship . Carving and Marking On receiving your application, the vessel will be issued with a Carving and Marking note. The vessel must be carved and marked and measured by an Authorised Measurer. A measurement  of vessels: 15 metres in length and over is carried out by one of the classification society surveyors, who complete a certificate of measurement and an International Convention certificate 1969 under 15 metres in length in England, Wales and Northern Ireland is carried out by a local Coastguard - in Scotland measurement is carried out by a local fishery officer and a certificate of measurement only is issued for these vessels The Carving and Marking note and the measurement certificate are then to be returned to the UK Ship Register in Cardiff, along with the appropriate fee. When you apply to register, you must have a list of nominated names for the vessel. These names must be unique to the port that you wish to register under. A Certificate of Registry is valid for five years and must be renewed if you want to continue to fish for profit. Fishing vessel survey A fishing vessel must be surveyed before it can be registered. In most cases surveys are carried out by a UK Ship Register surveyor. However, under certain circumstances, surveys can be carried out by a Class surveyor on our behalf. To avoid any lost time, a transfer of flag survey can be arranged to suit the working pattern of your vessel. The Principal Fishing Surveyor ( PFS ) will request a copy of all existing statutory certification in order that new certificates can be prepared prior to survey. If, during a survey, your vessel meets international standards of safety and pollution prevention, a short-term certification can be issued immediately. Full term certification would then follow in due course. Details of certification, plans and operational information will be discussed by the owner and the PFS . You can find a list of ports of choice on the UK Ship Register website . You can find a list of authorised surveyors/inspectors of marks on the UK Ship Register website . Small fishing vessel survey If you own a fishing vessel that is under 15 metres in LOA , it will not be subject to a regular statutory survey. However, UK law requires that registered small fishing vessels are seaworthy and equipped to a safe standard so still need to have regular inspections. If your vessel was built after 16 July 2007, its construction must conform to the Seafish standard for small fishing vessels. If your vessel does not conform to this standard you will not be able to register it. The only way to ensure that your vessel does conform is for Seafish to oversee the construction. If your vessel was built prior to 16 July 2007, you will need to prove that the vessel is seaworthy. To do this, you will need to go through Seafish who will complete a registration inspection. Seafish will examine the structure of your vessel against their standard for small fishing vessels. The UK registry will then examine the Seafish report and either: allow registration ask you to address areas of concern If there are any areas of concern, you will have to address them before registration can proceed.

All existing vessels that want to join the fishing vessel register will have to undergo a Seafish survey. Seafish surveys, fees and contact details Seafish charge a fee for the survey of existing vessels. To arrange Seafish work you should contact them directly. You can call Seafish Marine Services on 01472 252 300 or by Fax on 0131 558 1442. You can also contact them by email at information@seafishmarineservices.com . MCA Safety Inspections An MCA safety inspection on all vessels - new builds and otherwise - must follow the Seafish survey/registration inspection. The MCA inspection will cover safety equipment and crew qualifications and is free of charge. You can arrange an MCA safety inspection by contacting the relevant offices. These include: West UK: Plymouth Marine Office on 01752 266 211 or fax 01752 225826 East UK: Hull Marine Office on 01482 866 606 or fax 01482 869 Scotland and Northern Ireland: Aberdeen Marine Office on 01224 597 900 or fax 01224 573 725 Download MSF 5100 Application for Survey and Inspection of ships and fishing vessels .

Coastguard locate lost fisherman near Whitby  Maritime and Coastguard Agency At 11:30pm last night (Tuesday 8 July 2014), Humber Coastguard was contacted by the police regarding a missing fisherman. The man had descended the cliffs by rope at Castle Chamber Scar, between Whitby and Robin Hood’s Bay. The tide was coming in and the fisherman had lost battery power in his head torch and was unable to find the rope which led him back to the cliff top. He was able to phone for assistance, but the mobile telephone coverage in the area was patchy. Humber Coastguard coordinated the search for the man involving Coastguard rescue teams from Whitby and Robin Hood’s Bay. The Whitby inshore and all weather RNLI lifeboats and a rescue helicopter from RAF Leconfield were also tasked to the scene. The lifeboat spotted the man who was becoming cut off by the tide, and the helicopter airlifted him back to the cliff top. Bev Allen, Humber Coastguard Watch Manager, said: It is essential to make sure you are properly equipped for this type of activity. This gentleman could have been spotted faster if he had been wearing high visibility clothing, rather than a dark outfit. Unfortunately this area has remote telephone signal coverage and we were unable to contact him on his mobile phone. We recommend that night fishers always carry back up safety equipment, such as replacement batteries for torches, wear reflective safety clothing and some kind of flotation device in case you enter the water by mistake.

The Hoylake and Crosby Coastguard Rescue Teams, along with two Coastguard sector managers, were sent to the scene. The fire boat and specialist Merseyside fire units were also asked to attend. When rescue teams arrived, they found that the couple were stuck up to their knees not far from the river and were struggling to move. The dog was also unable to free itself. Using their specialist equipment, Coastguards were able to dislodge the mud around each of them and free their legs. They weren’t badly hurt, but the woman was taken to hospital to be checked over. Stuart Atkinson, Watch Manager at Liverpool Coastguard, said: Despite the warm and dry weather we’ve been having recently, there are still plenty of muddy patches along parts of our coastline that we need to keep a lookout for.

/government/news/one-man-and-his-dog-rescued-from-unseaworthy-sail-boat,"One man and his dog have been rescued after they became stranded in the Bristol Channel. One man and his dog rescued from unseaworthy sail boat  Maritime and Coastguard Agency A Coastguard-coordinated rescue in the Bristol Channel last night (Thursday 24 July 2014) has underlined the importance of ensuring a vessel is seaworthy and properly equipped before taking to the waves. Just before midnight, the Swansea Maritime Rescue Co-ordination Centre were contacted by the police who had received a call from a mariner, accompanied only by his dog, whose 17ft sailing boat had become stranded mid-Channel, just south of Lundy Island, after the outboard motor failed. Upon further investigation it was discovered that the vessel was one of the least seaworthy that Swansea Coastguards had encountered in a good while: its hull was leaking, the mast was missing, with an old windsurfing rig serving as a poor substitute; the boat had no lights, no VHF radio – the sailor contacted the emergency services on a mobile phone – and his GPS device wasn’t working, so he was unable to give his position. Coastguards had to use onshore telecommunications beacons to estimate his location to within 30km. The optimistic voyager, who had also neglected to carry any charts, informed Coastguards that he was en route to the Hebrides, having set out from Instow, North Devon. Coastguards had to use onshore telecommunications beacons to estimate his position to within 30km. This enabled them to task the search and rescue helicopter from Chivenor who spent two hours searching for a boat in the dark with no lights on, and just after four in the morning the sailor and canine companion were winched from the boat. RNLI’s Appledore lifeboat was tasked to recover the vessel from a position 2.5 miles SSW of Lundy so that it was no longer a danger to shipping in the busy Bristol Channel. The volunteer lifeboat crew returned to station at 0915 in the morning, ready for a full day’s work. Bernie Kemble, Swansea Coastguard Watch Officer, said: So many things were wrong with this gentleman’s boat and lack of preparation that the situation was almost comical. He had taken to sea in what was effectively a leaky fibreglass hull, without even the most basic communications and safety equipment. Thankfully, weather conditions were calm, he was avoided by other vessels in the area and he was able to use the only piece of communications equipment he had to hand – his mobile phone – to raise the alarm. However, the situation could have been far more serious and he and his dog were lucky that they were rescued promptly. We would remind anyone in trouble at sea or on the coast to dial 999 and ask for the Coastguard. The sailor and his dog were both reported to be unharmed by their ordeal. [Contact:1507]"

/government/news/search-after-reports-of-paraglider-ditching-in-lake-district,"The Coastguard coordinated a large search after reports that a paraglider had crash landed at Ullswater. Search after reports of paraglider ditching in Lake District  Maritime and Coastguard Agency Liverpool Coastguard received a telephone call just after 3pm on Wednesday 6 August 2014 from the company Ullswater Steamers stating that they’d been told a paraglider had ditched in the water. Boats on the lake were told about the situation and all vessels belonging to the Ullswater Steamer company along with two private vessels were asked to head to the scene. The Maryport Coastguard Rescue Team and the Mountain Rescue Teams from Penrith and Patterdale were also sent to investigate along with police units in the area. A search and rescue helicopter from RAF Boulmer was also called in to assist and carry out searches over the lake. The Tornado, a power boat on the lake, reported that they had come across a large balloon, approximately 1 metre by 1.5 metres that could well have been mistaken at a glance for a paragliders wing. After a thorough search of the area had been completed, Liverpool Coastguard stood units down once satisfied nobody was in the water. Lucy Hicks, Watch Manager at Liverpool Coastguard, said: We wanted to make sure that there was nobody in difficulty at Ullswater this afternoon and carried out a thorough search. We now believe that the incident was a false alarm with good intent and the culprit was indeed this balloon. I’d like to take this opportunity to remind those carrying out these types of activities, including paragliding, that you ensure the appropriate authorities are aware of your location and intentions. Paragliders should also be aware of wind conditions and local anomalies within the area of the lake as it is surrounded by high fells, and beware that gusts can create a downdraft and possibly cause a glider to ditch. If you spot anyone in difficulty on the water or at the coast, remember to call 999 and ask for the Coastguard. [Contact:1507]"

/guidance/high-speed-craft-construction-and-maintenance-standards,"Operational codes of practice, construction and maintenance standards for cargo or passenger high-speed craft and Ro-Ro. High-speed craft: construction and maintenance standards Construction, maintenance and operation standards Maritime and Coastguard Agency Introduction High-speed craft is a special category of sea-going vessels that includes hovercraft, catamarans and hydrofoils. The construction and operation of commercial high-speed craft is generally subject to similar legislation to that controlling other merchant shipping. However, because of the specific issues created by their speed of travel, there are both additional and substitute regulations that take account of the operation of these craft, whether used for cargo or passengers. This guide explains about operational codes of practice, construction and maintenance standards and discusses the specific issue of high-speed roll-on/roll-off craft. High-Speed Craft Code The International code of safety for high-speed craft was developed originally by the International Maritime Organization ( IMO ), which prepares the majority of regulations and standards concerning the operation of both cargo and passenger vessels operating on international voyages. The code provides comprehensive guidance on the correct equipment and methods of operation and maintenance for high-speed craft. A new chapter of the IMO ’s Safety of Life at Sea ( SOLAS ) Convention came into force in 1996, making the code mandatory for all high-speed craft built on or after 1 January 1996. The code is regularly updated to take account of technological developments for high-speed craft. The code has been adopted into UK maritime law, most recently through the Merchant Shipping (High Speed Craft) Regulations 2004 . Construction standards for high-speed craft The International Code of Safety for High-Speed Craft establishes detailed standards for construction of high-speed craft. These cover: structural considerations crew and passenger accommodation steering and control safety, life-saving and emergency equipment propulsion systems and machinery electrical, radio and navigational equipment stabilisation These standards are the basis on which ship surveys are conducted and on which operational certificates are issued. Many high-speed craft suffer from problems of control in following and quartering seas, prompting the Maritime and Coastguard Agency ( MCA ) to conduct research into the issue. You can download Marine guidance note (MGN) 327 (M) high-speed craft dynamic stability in following and quartering seas - design guidance . Maintenance and operational standards for high-speed craft The International Code of Safety for High-Speed Craft provides extensive guidelines on maintenance of the vessel, including preventative inspection, routine maintenance and modifications. The code also includes procedures for recording and reporting maintenance. Maintenance is a core issue in periodic inspections of the vessel. As an owner, if you fail to observe correct maintenance procedures this could lead to legal action against you. The code also gives detailed instructions for the correct operation of your high-speed vessels, including documentation, training, safety and emergency instructions. There are additional instructions for cargo and passenger craft, particularly for training and emergency procedures. Requirements for Ro-Ro high-speed craft High-speed roll-on/roll-off ( Ro-Ro ) vessels such as catamarans and hydrofoil craft are subject to the general requirements of the International Code of Safety for High-Speed Craft. However, they are also covered by specific regulations, particularly in relation to passenger and crew safety. There are specific references in the code to stability and buoyancy issues. Ro-Ro vessels are also covered by the damage stability requirements of the SOLAS Convention, while vessels operating on international voyages in northwest Europe and the Baltic must comply with the ‘Stockholm agreement’. Both of these lay down requirements for the stability of Ro-Ro vessels in the event of damage causing water to flood vehicle decks. Proving the seaworthiness of your high-speed craft All high-speed craft are subject to the 2001 Merchant Shipping (Mandatory Surveys for Ro-Ro Ferry and High Speed Passenger Craft) Regulations . These require that all vessels have an initial survey and a renewal survey after no more than 5 years and additional surveys as required, such as after substantial repairs take place. Inspections are also required of individual equipment such as safety systems, radios and navigational systems - some of which require more frequent surveys."
/government/news/falmouth-coastguard-operations-centre-joins-national-network,"Falmouth Coastguard Operations Centre (CGOC) is to become part of the new Coastguard national network for the very first time this week. Falmouth Coastguard Operations Centre joins national network  Maritime and Coastguard Agency Work has been carried out at the search and rescue coordination centre at Pendennis Point, upgrading the technology and introducing new systems. This means Falmouth CGOC will be connected to the National Maritime Operations Centre ( NMOC ) in Hampshire and other Coastguard stations around the country, which will be able to offer mutual support during busy periods. From Saturday 1 November 2014, Falmouth CGOC and the new national network will start to take on operations from Brixham Coastguard. The changes to Her Majesty’s Coastguard will see the NMOC and 10 other CGOCs around the UK work together to manage the workload. There will be no reduction in rescue resources. The availability of Coastguard Rescue Teams, lifeboats, rescue helicopters and other rescue units will be unaffected. James Instance, Maritime Operations Controller at Falmouth CGOC , said: The public won’t notice any difference to the way search and rescue missions are responded to. If you call 999 and ask for the Coastguard, or issue a mayday broadcast, we will still be here to help you. The only change is that we’ll have a new national network that will be able to oversee and assist with operations around the whole of the UK. Here at Falmouth CGOC we’re now part of this network, so we can call upon help from our fellow Coastguards elsewhere in the country, and also in turn help them out if needed. Peter Davies was manager at Brixham Coastguard and has now taken up a new role at the NMOC . He said: This new state-of-the-art network will ensure that we are better prepared and will improve how we manage the workload. It’s key to remember though that the changes affect how we deliver the coordination to search and rescue incidents, but the rescue teams in your community are unaffected. There will still be the same number of lifeboats, Coastguard Rescue Teams, helicopters and other rescue resources. I’d also like to take this opportunity to thank the staff at Brixham Coastguard, who have served the community with the upmost professionalism over many years. I am pleased that some are staying with the Coastguard and have relocated to roles elsewhere. The new national network is scheduled to be fully operational by the end of 2015. [Contact:1507]"

Over the coming months, seven more coastguard helicopter bases will open and our current base at Lee on Solent will move over to the Bristow contract. As the new bases open, the military helicopters which currently carry out civilian search and rescue will finish their civilian obligations. The new crews will be highly experienced, many will be existing crew who are currently working in search and rescue either for the military or coastguard. The helicopters will provide search and rescue many miles out to sea and all the way around the 10,500 miles of UK coast. Our coastguard helicopters will also operate extensively inland. The helicopters are Sikorsky S92s and Agusta Westland AW189s. They can fly further and faster than those helicopters they replace. The latest technologies including night vision, infrared, thermal imaging and high illumination lighting technology will all be used by the crew to find people in distresss and bring them to safety."

Assessing risk and responding to UK coastal and marine pollution Pollution prevention Maritime and Coastguard Agency Maritime and Coastguard Agency ( MCA ) is the UK’s competent authority responsible for the provision of response procedures designed to deal with any emergency at sea that threatens or causes actual pollution. National contingency plan for marine pollution from shipping and offshore installations The draft national contingency plan for marine pollution from shipping and offshore installations has been recently reviewed and is out to consultation. It sets out revised procedures for incident response. MCA programmes and takes part in maritime exercises designed to maintain the operational readiness of its staff and equipment. Its Counter Pollution and Response ( CPR ) branch also organises training courses for local authorities ( LAs ) to prepare their staff when responding to shoreline pollution. Oil spill contingency regulations and guidelines OPRC regulations The 1998 Oil Pollution Preparedness, Response and Co-operation Convention ( OPRC ) regulations state that UK ports, harbours and oil-handling facilities must prepare and submit oil spill response contingency plans to MCA for approval. This must be done if the port, harbour or oil handling facility is in any one of the following categories: any harbour where a statutory harbour authority has an annual turnover of more than £1 million any harbour or oil-handling facility offering berths alongside, on buoys or at anchor, to ships of over 400 gross tonnes (gt) or oil tankers of over 150 gt any harbour or oil-handling facility in respect of which the Secretary of State ( SoS ) has served the harbour authority or operator a notice stating that he is of the opinion that maritime activities undertaken at that harbour or facility involve a significant risk of spillage of over 10 tonnes of oil any harbour or oil-handling facility on which the SoS has served the harbour authority or operator a notice stating that he is of the opinion that it is located in an area of significant environmental sensitivity, or in an area where a discharge of oil or other substances could cause significant economic damage OPRC guidelines The OPRC guidelines are for those involved in the creation of oil spill response contingency plans. They promote a coherent national approach to the successful management of oil pollution incidents. They’re designed to ensure that the national contingency plan ( NCP ) and local plans, including those of harbour authorities, work together to respond effectively. Shoreline clean-up assessment techniques (SCAT) As part of an oil spill response, SCAT teams systematically survey the area affected by the spill to provide rapid accurate geo-referenced documentation of shoreline oiling conditions. This information is used to develop real-time decision-making and to expedite shoreline treatment planning and response operations. A SCAT programme includes field assessment surveys, data management, and data application components as part of the spill management organisation. The field survey teams use specific and standard terminology to describe and define shoreline oiling conditions. The SCAT process is flexible, and the assessment activities are designed to match the unique spill conditions. The SCAT manual is a field guide to the documentation of oiled shorelines in the UK. You can download the SCAT manual and SCAT rapid survey form and instructions . Training courses The following MCA courses are accredited by the Nautical Institute and are for LAs .

/government/news/mud-rescue-exercise-at-wirrals-west-kirby-beach,"Coastguards and Merseyside Fire & Rescue Service put their skills to the test this weekend, as they took part in a joint training exercise. Mud rescue exercise at Wirral's West Kirby beach  Maritime and Coastguard Agency Coastguard Rescue Officers from the Hoylake and New Brighton teams were involved in mud rescue scenarios alongside fire officers. The exercise took place on West Kirby beach on the Wirral on Sunday 30 November 2014. Starting at 8.30am, a simulated 999 call reported that two people were stuck in the mud near to West Kirby Marine Lake, an area not uncommon for real mud rescues to occur. Both emergency services arrived on scene and set up their mud rescue equipment and worked together to free and bring the casualties safely ashore. This was an opportunity for the Coastguard and Merseyside Fire & Rescue Service to share knowledge, training and skills in a collaborative way to benefit future rescues. Coastguard Rescue Officer Gary Wright coordinated the joint exercise. He said: Our priority is getting the best outcome for the casualty and joint working between emergency services is essential to that. Through this exercise, we have developed closer working relationships and a better understanding of how the Coastguard and Merseyside Fire & Rescue Service can support each other in mud rescues on the Wirral coast. In addition to mud and quicksand rescues, Coastguard Rescue Teams are also trained and equipped to deal with a wide range of other emergencies, including water rescue, rope rescue and searching for lost or missing people. We hope to carry out further joint training exercises like this involving other emergency services, to continue to build on our existing strengths and capabilities. Between 1 January 2014 – 1 December 2014, Liverpool Coastguard dealt with 70 mud incidents. The Coastguard is a 24/7 emergency service, ready to respond at any time day or night to incidents on our coastline or out at sea. If you see someone in difficulty at the coast, call 999 and ask for the Coastguard. [Contact:1507]"
/guidance/fishing-vessels-standards-for-construction-and-maintenance,"Codes of practice and standards for constructing, maintaining and operating fishing vessels  Fishing vessels:  construction and maintenance standards Vessel and crew safety and certification Maritime and Coastguard Agency Introduction The construction, maintenance and operation of fishing vessels is controlled by national and international regulations and legislation. These form the basis of the classification, certification and inspection of fishing vessels. This guide outlines the standards and regulations applying to fishing vessels. It also covers sources of additional information for owners, operators and crew. Fishing Vessels: Codes of Practice The standards for the construction and maintenance of fishing vessels vary according to the vessel’s overall length. There are separate standards for fishing vessels, covering fishing vessels of the following length: up to 15 metres overall length from 15 overall length to 24 metres registered length over 24 metres registered length Vessels under 24 metres registered length Vessels of less than 24 metres are covered by codes of practice, set out in the Maritime and Coastguard Agency ( MCA ) documents, Merchant Shipping Notice ( MSN ) 1813 (F) and MSN 1770 (F). Vessels over 24 metres registered length The code of practice for fishing vessels over 24 metres in length were published in 2011. The codes and regulations cover fishing vessel design and construction - as well as maintenance, safety and emergency procedures. They form the basis for surveys of new vessels, and of the periodic surveys of all fishing vessels over 15 metres length. Vessels under 15 metres overall length Fishing vessels under 15 metres are not subject to statutory surveys, but the MCA will inspect them periodically to ensure they are seaworthy, equipped to a safe standard, and that they comply with the relevant code. Construction standards for fishing vessels If your fishing vessels are registered in the UK, or operating in UK waters, they are required by law to be seaworthy and equipped to a safe standard. Specific construction standards cover the physical structure of the vessel - including deckhouses and superstructures - and machinery and equipment. The Sea Fish Industry Authority ( Seafish ) has established construction standards for fishing vessels of up to 15 metres overall length, and of 15 to less than 24 metres. All new vessels must meet these standards. Vessels up to 15 metres overall length If you want to register a vessel of up to 15 metres on the UK register, you must demonstrate its seaworthiness and safety. If your vessels were built after 16 July 2007, they must conform to the Seafish Construction Standards. If your vessels were built before 16 July 2007, you must prove they are seaworthy by submitting them to Seafish for a registration survey, for assessment against their standards. After registration, you will need to arrange a MCA inspection of safety equipment and crew qualifications. This inspection must be repeated every five years, along with annual self certification. For more information, see the guide fishing vessel classification, registration and inspection . Details of Seafish survey fees can be obtained by contacting Seafish Marine Services on 01472 252 300 or by emailing information@seafishmarineservices.com . Vessels 15 to 24 metres overall length Medium-sized fishing vessels must meet the construction requirements in the code of practice for fishing vessels of 15 to 24 metres. Download Merchant Shipping Notice ( MSN ) 1770 (F) The Code of Safe Working Practice for the Construction and Use of 15-24 Metre Fishing Vessels from the MCA website (PDF, 1.23MB). New vessels in this size range must also conform to the Seafish Construction Standards. These vessels must be surveyed by Seafish against their Construction Standards, then undergo an MCA survey under the code of practice MSN 1770. The vessel should be resurveyed after five years to renew its Fishing Vessel Certificate, and also undergo a mid-term inspection. Owners must also complete an annual self-certification. For more information, see the guide to fishing vessel classification, registration and inspection . Vessels over 24 metres The construction of larger fishing vessels is governed by the Fishing Vessels (EC Directive on Harmonised Safety Regime) Regulations 1999, as amended in 2003. The regulations require vessels of this size to comply with the Torremolinos Protocol and the amendments to the protocol contained in the 1999 and 2003 Regulations. The protocol sets standards in areas such as construction, stability, machinery, emergency procedures and vessel certification. Existing vessels should also comply with the Fishing Vessels (Safety Provisions) Rules 1975, as amended. Your surveyor can provide guidance on which sections of the rules apply to you. Fishing vessels over 24 metres must be surveyed annually by UK-authorised Classification Societies, to ensure compliance with the regulations. The Classification Society will carry out a full survey every five years, to ensure the vessel remains in class. The six Classification Societies are: American Bureau of Shipping Bureau Veritas Det Norske Veritas Germanischer Lloyd Lloyds Register of Shipping Registro Italiano Navale The MCA will survey the vessel for its International Fishing Vessel Certificate when the owner wishes to place it on the UK Register, and at intervals of four years afterwards. The MCA will also carry out an intermediate survey, 21 to 27 months after the certificate was issued. For more information, see the guide to fishing vessel classification, registration and inspection . Maintenance standards for fishing vessels Fishing vessel codes of practice emphasise the importance of regular maintenance of a high standard - particularly of safety equipment and systems. For vessels below 24 metres in length, this requirement forms part of the annual self-certification needed to maintain the Fishing Certificate. The MCA inspects vessels of 15 to 24 metres overall length. Vessels over 24 metres have safety equipment and systems checked annually, and are also subject to more detailed statutory intermediate surveys. If safety equipment is not properly maintained, vessels may be detained and the owners prosecuted. The MCA also provides guidance on specific problems, such as: premature failure of copper pipes in engine cooling water systems avoiding engine failure due to fuel contamination avoiding flooding by using suitable grades of stainless steel for pipe work bilge systems and additional/alternative equipment to help prevent flooding testing of emergency sources of electrical power maintenance of electrical equipment maintenance of portable fire extinguishers fire detection and alarm systems on fishing vessels The Royal National Lifeboat Institution ( RNLI ) publishes a range of leaflets, reports and DVDs on fishing safety. Find fishing safety advice on the RNLI website. Flooding The condition of seawater pipework within a fishing vessel is an important factor in preventing flooding in a vessel. Stainless steel seawater pipework can reduce pipework corrosion, but some grades of stainless steel are not suitable for marine use. For example, austenitic stainless steels (304/304L and 316/316L) may be at risk of chloride stress corrosion cracking when used with seawater or polluted water, possibly leading to fracture. One solution is to increase the nickel content (eg alloy 330, 904L) or to use a duplex or ferritic stainless steel, eg 329, 2205, 439, 26Cr 1 Mo.

You can contact the RNLI helpline on 0800 328 0600 or email fishingsafety@rnli.org.uk . Operational standards for fishing vessels Fishing vessel codes of practice and regulations provide guidance on best practice in areas such as: fire protection, including fire precautions and the deployment and use of fire-protection equipment protection of personnel, including risk assessments, accident prevention and securing of equipment life-saving equipment emergency procedures, including inspections and drills in relation to emergency procedures You must ensure that all onboard equipment is of serviceable condition and regularly maintained. Equipment and maintenance schedules are inspected during statutory surveys of vessels over 15 metres in length. The MCA will check these areas in smaller fishing vessels during normal inspections.

/guidance/inland-waterways-and-categorisation-of-waters,"Details for owners, operators and Masters of vessels on inland waters, including categorisation, application, safety requirements and best practice. Inland waterways and categorisation of waters Inland waterways Maritime and Coastguard Agency Introduction The UK has over 4,000 miles of inland waterways. Construction requirements and levels of safety equipment that must be carried on vessels in the UK depend on the nature of the waters in which the vessel operates. There are no national construction requirements for private pleasure vessels. Inland waters are categorised as A, B, C or D. This includes canals, non-tidal rivers, tidal rivers, large, deep lakes and lochs, and estuaries. Inland water categorisation policy and processes are dealt with by the Navigation Safety Branch ( NSB ) of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency ( MCA ). These categories are defined and listed in Merchant Shipping Notice ( MSN ) 1776. This guide explains what inland waters are, how they are categorised, how to apply for categorisation of waters, safety requirements for vessels operating on inland waters, and best practice to adopt. It is aimed at owners, operators and Masters of vessels operating in all inland waters categories. Inland waters and how they are categorised ‘Inland waters’ includes any area of water not categorised as ‘sea’ - eg canals, tidal and non-tidal rivers, lakes, and some estuarial waters (an arm of sea that extends inland to meet the mouth of a river). Inland waters are classified as one of four categories: Category A - narrow rivers and canals where the depth of water is generally less than 1.5 metres Category B - wider rivers and canals where the depth of water is generally 1.5 metres or more and where the significant wave height could not be expected to exceed 0.6 metres at any time Category C - tidal rivers, estuaries and large, deep lakes and lochs where the significant wave height could not be expected to exceed 1.2 metres at any time Category D - tidal rivers and estuaries where the significant wave height could not be expected to exceed 2 metres at any time These categorisations determine the waters not regarded as ‘sea’ for the purposes of most Merchant Shipping legislation, except that, for marine pollution legislation, ‘sea’ normally includes any estuaries or arms of the sea, and therefore tidal Category C, and Category D, waters. Water categorisation policy and processes are dealt with by MCA . You can search a map of UK waterways on the MCA website . Find a list of waterways in the UK and their classifications on the MCA website . You can also  download MSN 1776 (M) on the categorisation of waters from the MCA website (PDF, 679KB) . Applications for categorisation of waters Inland waters are not regarded as ‘sea’ for the purposes of Merchant Shipping legislation and vessels operating in categorised waters have different construction and equipment standards. Because of this, it is important that the area you conduct your business in is correctly categorised. You can make a request for the categorisation - or re-categorisation - of a defined area of water as long as you hold an interest in the area requested. Water categorisation matters are co-ordinated by the Hydrography, Meteorology and Ports Branch of the MCA . Applications for categorisation - or re-categorisation - are considered by the Limits Committee, working with regard to the opinion of the local Marine Office. If you intend to apply, you should seek advice about categorisation of a particular stretch of water from your local Marine Office. You can find contact details for your local MCA Marine Office on the MCA website . Categorising or re-categorising an area of water Applications for categorisation or requests to change an existing categorisation may be made by any person or organisation with an interest and need to be fully supported and accompanied by the following information as appropriate: chart of location recent sounding charts levels of vessel movement types of vessel using the area physical description of the area details of significant wave heights predominant wind chart for the area general rationale to support the application supporting letter from the local Harbour/Navigation Authority Evidence as to how the significant wave height has been established has to be provided. This information should, ideally, include evidence that the significant wave height at a representative point or points within the proposed area, does not, at any time, exceed the maximum limit specified in the definition of the proposed category. That is: Category B - up to 0.6 metres Category C - up to 1.2 metres Category D - up to 2.0 metres This evidence could, for example, be based upon information derived from a mathematical model of the geographic area that has been validated by wave height observations from a wave rider buoy or seabed pressure sensor. Other evidence may be accepted if considered suitable by the Limits Committee of Focal Point Group 2. For an application for a winter or summer seasonal area, measurements should represent the period of worst weather. For all-year-round applications, measurements should represent the worst winter conditions. In addition to wave heights you should also consider other factors such as the: strength of any tidal stream effect of the prevailing wind against the tidal stream which can shorten the sea - giving rise to steeper waves which are more liable to break height of banks at the water’s edge and the degree of shelter that may be found in bad weather effect of any surrounding high land which may give rise to sudden and unpredictable wind shifts and strengths fetch of the wind - especially in long, straight estuaries with a low lying hinterland effect of underwater banks on the tidal streams effect of shifting underwater sand banks which result in changing navigational channels relevant local phenomena - eg a bore Consideration of applications The NSB co-ordinates the categorisation of a defined area of water which is listed in MSN 1776 (M). You can  download MSN 1776 (M) on the categorisation of waters from the MCA website (PDF, 679KB) . The MCA will consider any request for the categorisation of new or for changes in the existing categorisation of areas. For a successful application the following process needs to be followed, to avoid unnecessary delays. Once the application is complete, all supporting documents are sent to the local Marine Office for the attention of the Surveyor-in-Charge ( SIC ) or Area Operations Manager ( AOM ). Find contact details for your local Marine Office on the MCA website . The SIC or AOM will consult with the nearest Coastguard Station and the District Safety Committee or Small Passenger Ship Steering Group as appropriate. They may want further clarification and revert back to the applicant. Once content with the application they will revert with comments / recommendations to the NSB . NSB will review the application within 28 days and if considered appropriate will submit the application to the Limits Committee of Focal Point Group 2 for consideration and ratification. Find information on the categorisation of waters on the MCA website . Safety requirements for boats to operate on inland waters If you operate a vessel commercially on inland waters, you must comply with construction regulations and standards for safety equipment to be carried onboard. Inland water passenger ships that were not new at April 2010 are covered by several sets of regulations and guidance - your local MCA Marine Office can provide you with advice about these. A ‘passenger ship’ is a vessel that carries more than 12 passengers. You can find contact details for your local MCA Marine Office on the MCA website . The Safety Code for Passenger Ships Operating Solely in UK Categorised Waters provides the technical requirements for new passenger vessels, from April 2010. The Code also contains safety requirements with which the ship must comply in order to secure a Passenger Ship Safety Certificate. A ‘passenger ship’ is a vessel that carries more than 12 passengers. You can download the Safety Code for Passenger Ships Operating Solely in UK Categorised Waters from the MCA website (PDF, 1.67MB) .  For further information, please contact your local MCA Marine Office. The European Commission Directive 2006/87/EC (as amended) on Technical Requirements for Inland Waterways Vessels lays down the technical requirements for inland waterway vessels. Vessels that operate only on UK inland waterways will be exempt from the Directive, provided they comply with applicable UK technical and safety requirements. However, vessels that operate on the Community waterways of European Union Member States in mainland Europe will be subject to the technical requirements laid down in the Directive. Vessel owners or operators who wish to operate their vessels on those waterways will need to get in touch with the relevant waterway authorities in the country concerned, in order to obtain a Community Inland Navigation certificate. You can find the Commission Directive 2006/87/EC (as amended) on Technical Requirements for Inland Waterways Vessels on the MCA website . The Code for the Design, Construction and Operation of Hire Boats is a national code of safe practice for boats let for hire on inland waterways. It applies to vessels for not more than 12 people without a skipper or crew for sport or pleasure (excluding pleasure vessels as defined in the Merchant Shipping (Vessels in Commercial Use for Sport or Pleasure) Regulations 1998). The Code covers: risk assessment technical standards operational standards change control record keeping You can download the Code for the Design, Construction and Operation of Hire Boats from the MCA website (PDF, 404KB) . For vessels carrying no more than 12 passengers on inland waters, see the section in this guide on the ‘Inland Waters Small Passenger Boat Code’. Registration and licensing for vessels operating on inland waters Vessels operating on inland waters must be registered and hold a licence. British Waterways and the Environment Agency are the two major navigation authorities in charge of inland rivers, canals, estuaries and harbours in the UK. All craft wishing to cruise on the inland waterways network must be registered with the appropriate region of British Waterways or the Environment Agency. Failure to do so may result in prosecution and a fine. Every type of pleasure craft must be registered and licensed, including motor cruisers, sailing cruisers, narrow boats, open vessels such as canoes or rowing boats, and houseboats. A variety of different licences are available, from annual licences to visitor licences. You should contact the Environment Agency or British Waterways to find out what the registration and licence arrangements are for your area. All applications for vessel licences must be accompanied by a valid Boat Safety Scheme ( BSS ) certificate, except for privately owned open boats and vessels carrying MCA certification. Every vessel must display its current valid navigation certificate and registration number at all times. For rivers and canals not controlled by the British Waterways or the Environment Agency, you should seek advice from whoever controls the navigation and their licensing requirements. You can find a list of Navigational Authorities on the MCA website . For more information, also see the guides on how to apply for, upgrade or renew a Boatmasters’ Licence , Vessel classification and certification, and standards for the construction and maintenance of inland waterway vessels . Alcohol and entertainment licensing The Licensing Act 2003 applies the alcohol and entertainment licensing regime to vessels on which alcohol is sold, or entertainment takes place. You can find  information on alcohol and entertainment licensing on the Department for Culture, Media and Sport ( DCMS ) website . The Inland Waters Small Passenger Boat Code The Inland Waters Small Passenger Boat Code is a best practice guide for vessels carrying no more than 12 passengers on inland waters designed to ensure safety, technical and competency standards are met. This includes trip boats, hotel boats and water taxis operating in harbour areas, estuaries, lakes, rivers and canals. The Code lays down benchmark safety standards and is intended to be applied on the basis of risk and the operators’ experience. It is non-mandatory and provides advice to operators, navigation authorities and licensing authorities. When operating a boat on inland waters, you should always consider any: area of operation, and any possible weather conditions availability of dedicated emergency rescue operations wholly within sight of the supervising body seasonal operations only - eg between 1 April and 31 October vessels operating in close proximity to one another provision or wearing of additional individual personal survival equipment enhanced communications between vessels nature of the sport or pleasure activity safety of any vessel - by design, test and experience ratio of suitably trained crew to other persons onboard enhanced provisions for distress alert and rescue means provided for ‘dry’ evacuation from a vessel in emergency situations The Small Passenger Boat Code covers a wide array of information, but in particular covers all of the following: machinery - such as diesel, petrol, steam, LPG or electronically powered engines electrics - eg electrical installations and how to reduce the risk of electric shocks steering gears - how the vessel should be provided with an effective means of steering bilge pumping and drainage - how powered or hand-operated bilge pumping must be adequate for the size of the vessel stability - for specific types of vessels, such as motor vessels, inflatable boats, sailing vessels and sailing multihull vessels freeboards - for motor vessels in all inland water categories, and inflatable boats life-saving and fire-fighting appliances navigation equipment - covering navigation lights, shapes and sound signals accommodation safety briefings - of staff and any passengers Access the  Inland Waterways Small Passenger Boat Code .

Inland waterway vessels: construction and maintenance standards Inland waterways Maritime and Coastguard Agency Introduction When designing and constructing a boat’s hull, the materials and equipment you use must be suitable for the service they are intended for. You must also make sure that the boat’s structural strength is adequate for the safe operation of the vessel in the areas it’s intended for. The standards for designing, constructing and maintaining the hull, main and auxiliary machinery, electrical and automatic plants of a vessel must be done with the rules in place at the date of its construction. Some types of vessels, such as passenger ships, may also have to be specified for classification by a recognised organisation, such as a Classification Society. Safe maintenance standards for inland waterway vessels There are codes, best practice guides and standards you need to be aware of in order to safely maintain inland waterway vessels. These are relevant for designers, builders, surveyors, vessel operators, certifying authorities and users of inland waterway vessels. You also need to consider technical requirements, contained in merchant shipping notices and regulations. The following documents address standards of construction and equipment for inland waterway vessels.

/guidance/standards-for-the-construction-and-maintenance-of-passenger-ships,"Codes of practice and standards for safely operating and navigating passenger ships, catamarans and hovercrafts. Passenger ships: construction and maintenance standards Construction, maintenance and operation standards Maritime and Coastguard Agency Introduction A wide range of international regulations ensure the safe operation of passenger ships. There are also specific codes of practice for small passenger vessels operating in UK inland waters and for other passenger ships operating in UK waters. In addition to the legislation for passenger ships there are also regulations controlling the operation of roll-on/roll-off passenger ships and high-speed vessels such as catamarans and hovercrafts. This guide discusses the construction, maintenance and operational standards for passenger ships. Passenger ships codes of practice There is an exceptionally wide range of regulations and standards covering passenger ship construction and operation. Many of these are incorporated in Conventions of the International Maritime Organization ( IMO ). The most significant IMO Conventions in relation to passenger ships are the Safety of Life at Sea ( SOLAS ) and Load Lines Conventions. Each of these is regularly reviewed and - where necessary - updated. All UK-registered passenger ships operating internationally must comply with their terms. Read detailed information about the IMO ’s work on passenger ships on the IMO website . For ships operating solely in UK waters - and for small passenger vessels operating in UK inland waterways - there are separate codes of practice. For a comprehensive list of UK categorised waters, download Merchant Shipping Notice ( MSN ) 1776 (M) Categorisation of Waters from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency ( MCA ) website (PDF, 186K) . These codes incorporate guidance on complying with the various regulations concerning the construction and safe operation of passenger vessels operating only in UK waters. They provide standards mainly for safety issues but also comprehensive guidance on vessel construction. They also cover the installation and operation of machinery and equipment including navigation, radio and safety systems. There is a special code of practice for high-speed craft such as catamarans. For more information, read the guide to standards for the construction and maintenance of high-speed craft . Construction standards for passenger ships UK-registered passenger ships on international voyages must be built in accordance with the 1998 Passenger Ship Construction Regulations. These regulations establish a series of standards, which cover issues ranging from stability to steering gear.

Passenger ships are normally classified according to the types of voyage that they undertake and there are separate standards for different classes of ship. For a detailed explanation see Vessel classification and certification . For passenger ships operating solely within UK waters, the construction standards are incorporated into the codes of practice. These cover a similar range of issues with a specific emphasis on safety. Maintenance standards for passenger ships Appropriate maintenance of equipment and machinery used on passenger vessels, including safety equipment and services, is controlled through legislation. Maintenance issues are reviewed as part of the regular surveys UK-registered ships are subject to. In addition, the MCA has the right to inspect maintenance logs and take relevant action if equipment is not adequately maintained. Operational standards for passenger ships The operation of passenger vessels is subject to a wide range of regulations, which cover issues such as safety management, radio and navigational installations and training. Passenger ships are also covered by merchant vessel codes of practice, and by performance standards for radio equipment, navigation systems, the Global Maritime Distress Safety System and marine equipment. Requirements for ro-ro passenger ships Roll-on/roll-off (ro-ro) vessels are designed to carry wheeled vehicles and equipment and are widely used for short-sea ferry operations for both passenger cars and heavy-goods traffic. They are covered by passenger and merchant shipping regulations and codes of practice. Some ro-ro vessels are high-speed craft such as catamarans, and for these vessels specific regulations apply. For more information on this you can see the guide on standards for the construction and maintenance of high-speed craft . There are specific considerations which need to be considered for the stability of ro-ro ships and for the safety of passengers and crew members moving about on vehicle decks.

/government/news/holyhead-coastguard-operations-centre-joins-national-network,"Holyhead Coastguard Operations Centre (CGOC) is to become part of the new Coastguard national network for the very first time this week. Holyhead Coastguard Operations Centre joins national network  Maritime and Coastguard Agency Work has been carried out at the search and rescue coordination centre to upgrade the technology and introduce new systems. This means Holyhead CGOC will be connected to the National Maritime Operations Centre ( NMOC ) in Hampshire and other Coastguard stations around the country, which will be able to offer mutual support during busy periods. From January 2015, Holyhead CGOC and the new national network will start to take on operations from Liverpool Coastguard. The changes to Her Majesty’s Coastguard will see the NMOC and 10 other CGOCs around the UK work together to manage the workload. There will be no reduction in rescue resources. The availability of Coastguard Rescue Teams, lifeboats, rescue helicopters and other rescue units will be unaffected. Graham Clark, Maritime Operations Controller at Holyhead CGOC , said: The way we deliver the coordination of search and rescue operations on our coast and out at sea is changing. But the public won’t notice any difference. If you call 999 and ask for the Coastguard, or issue a mayday broadcast, we will still be here to help you. The new national Coastguard network will be able to oversee and assist with operations around the whole of the UK. Here at Holyhead CGOC we’re now part of this network, so we can call upon help from our fellow Coastguards elsewhere in the country, and also in turn help them out if needed. It’s vital to remember though that the rescue teams in your community are unaffected. There will still be the same number of lifeboats, Coastguard Rescue Teams, helicopters and other rescue resources. The new national network is scheduled to be fully operational by the end of 2015.

/guidance/maritime-security,"How ship security is managed in the UK, and how to comply with EU regulation on ship security.  Ship security Maritime safety Maritime and Coastguard Agency Overview The maritime community has a series of special measures to enhance maritime security. These are contained in the International Convention for Safety of Life at Sea ( SOLAS ) Chapter XI-2 and the International Ship and Port Facility ( ISPS ) Code. The EU regulation on enhancing ship and port facility security transposes SOLAS XI-2 and the ISPS Code into UK law and requires EU member states to introduce effective sanctions for breaching provisions of the regulation. This guide explains how maritime security is managed in the UK, how security measures are applied and how you should comply with them. It also provides guidance on how to deal with stowaways and deter acts of violence against merchant ships, such as piracy and armed robbery. You can find guidance on complying with European Commission ( EC ) inspections of ships and shipping companies, and information on maritime security training. It also explains how Ship Identification Numbers ( SINs ) and Continuous Synopsis Records ( CSRs ) work. Maritime security management The Security Policy Branch is part of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency ( MCA ) and co-ordinates a series of special measures to ensure security in the maritime community. The MCA Security Policy Branch The Security Policy Branch provides technical advice and guidance to make sure that SOLAS Chapter XI-2 and ISPS Code are consistently applied and maintained. The Department for Transport and the MCA Security Policy Branch DfT is responsible for security across all forms of transport, including maritime. As policy leaders and advisers, DfT implements measures in UK ports and on UK-registered ships carrying more than 12 passengers to ensure that security arrangements meet UK standards. The MCA is responsible to DfT for: implementing the ISPS Code for all UK-registered cargo ships undertaking security aspects of Port State Control ( PSC ) inspections of foreign vessels in UK ports, including passenger ships where this is a logical extension of the PSC inspection receiving and handling ship security alerts in line with agreed standard operating procedures approving and auditing training providers for Ship Security Officer ( SSO ) and Company Security Officer ( CSO ) courses The ISPS Code is a comprehensive set of measures designed to strengthen the security of ships and port facilities. It is implemented through the EU regulation on enhancing ship and port facility security (725/2004). The code has two parts, one mandatory (Part A) and one recommendatory (Part B). The EU regulation makes some of Part B of the ISPS Code mandatory. The code takes the approach that ensuring the security of ships and port facilities is a risk management activity and that, to determine what security measures are appropriate, an assessment of the risks must be made in each particular case. The purpose of the code is to provide a standardised, consistent framework for evaluating risk. This enables governments to counteract changes in threat with changes in vulnerability for ships and port facilities by adopting the appropriate security levels and corresponding security measures. For further information, you can call the MCA Security Policy Branch on 023 8032 9478 or email them at HQ_maritimesecurity@mcga.gov.uk . Ship Security Plans To comply with the ISPS Code requirements, every company/ship must have a Ship Security Plan ( SSP ). As a minimum, this must address the requirements in paragraph A/9.4 and B/9.2 (made mandatory by EU regulation) of the code. The purpose of an SSP is to: help prevent illegal acts against the ship, crew and passengers minimise damage to the marine environment and port facilities SSPs for UK-registered vessels must be approved by the MCA , except for passenger ships, which are approved by the Department for Transport ( DfT ). When you submit an SSP it must be accompanied by a Ship Security Assessment ( SSA ). The SSA is an essential and integral part of the process of developing and updating an SSP . Cargo Ship Security Instructions show CSOs for UK-registered cargo ships what must be contained within SSPs . For a copy of the Cargo Ship Security Instructions, email the Security Policy Branch at hq_maritimesecurity@mcga.gov.uk . You should send your SSP to your assigned security liaison officer for approval. There is no charge applicable for approving SSPs at present. Ship Security Alert Systems ( SSAS ) The SSAS is part of the ISPS Code. It is a system that contributes to the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO’s) efforts to strengthen maritime security and suppress acts of terrorism and piracy against shipping. The SSAS for UK-registered ships should be programmed to send an alert to the competent authority approved by the MCA , and to Maritime Rescue Co-ordination Centre Falmouth.

EC inspections for marine security Under European Commission Regulation 324/2008, the Commission has powers to inspect UK-registered ships while in a port of an EU member state. A ship may be selected by the Commission for inspection when it is berthed in a port that is undergoing a security inspection. Download the Commission’s Regulation 324/2008 from the MCA website (PDF, 55KB)   The MCA or DfT normally notify ships or shipping companies of any inspection. Sometimes notification comes from the maritime administration of the EU member state of the port the ship is located in. It is a legal requirement to help the Commission conduct these inspections, and they have the same right to inspect all aspects of the ship’s maritime security compliance as UK flag inspectors. The Merchant Shipping (Ship Inspection and Survey Organisations) Regulations 1996 (contained in Merchant Shipping Notice No. M.1672) contains information on common rules and standards for ship inspection and survey organisations.

Ship Identification Numbers and Continuous Synopsis Records SINs and CSRs are special measures to ensure maritime safety contained in the SOLAS Chapter XI-1. They are also closely associated with the application of the ISPS Code. SOLAS Chapter XI-1 Regulation 3/4.1 requires that a SIN be permanently marked in a visible place on the vessel, eg: on the stern on either side of the hull, amidships port and starboard, above the deepest assigned load line on either side of the superstructure, port and starboard on the front of the superstructure in the case of passenger ships, on a horizontal surface visible from the air Identification for large commercial yachts UK-registered large commercial yachts are authorised to display the SIN on a ‘horizontal surface visible from the air’, in the same way as passenger ships. Read about large commercial yachts’ SINs and markings on the MCA website . Continuous Synopsis Record The CSR is intended to provide an on-board record of the history of the ship. Every ship that SOLAS Chapter I applies to must have an updated CSR containing specified information, including: name of the state for which the ship is entitled to fly the flag date of ship registration SIN port it is registered at name, registered address and unique identification number of owner The Registry of Seamen and Shipping issues CSRs .

/government/news/flying-the-flag-for-merchant-navy-day,"Merchant Navy Day celebrated at Department for Transport. Flying the flag for Merchant Navy Day  Department for Transport Maritime and Coastguard Agency The Red Ensign flag will fly over the headquarters of the Department for Transport to mark the UK’s twelfth Merchant Navy Day on Saturday, 3 September (2011). Instigated in 2000, Merchant Navy Day provides an opportunity to honour those merchant seafarers who have in many cases given their lives to the industry, as well as the chance to celebrate success and look ahead to the future of British shipping. Shipping Minister, Mike Penning, said: This country has a rich and proud maritime heritage covering many centuries and I am confident this will continue long into the future. It is often forgotten that over 20,000 merchant seafarers lost their lives in the Second World War alone, doing a job that was crucial to the war effort. On Merchant Navy Day we remember them, and the other men and women of the Merchant Navy who have lost their lives over the years. Shipping is every bit as important to the UK today - with the vast majority of goods arriving in our country by sea. The twenty-first century has so far been marked by a revival in the fortunes of British shipping, which I am determined to see continue. More young people are being attracted to a career at sea, and more ships are flying the Red Ensign. Our shipping register has a reputation for high standards, which we have every intention of maintaining. So we salute British ships and seafarers, and look with optimism to the future prosperity of the UK maritime sector. Further information The Red Ensign is the official flag of the commercial shipping fleet of the UK and its Crown Dependencies and Overseas Territories. It will fly over the headquarters of the Department for Transport - Great Minster House in Marsham Street, London SW1 - on Saturday 3 September. The significance of the date is that it is the anniversary of the sinking of the SS Athenia, the first British merchant vessel lost during World War II. Since July 2001 the UK registered fleet has increased from 6,700,130 to 18,074,997 gross tons, an increase of over 160% over the past decade. The UK has the eleventh largest Merchant Fleet in the world and the fourth largest in Europe. The increase in tonnage on the UK shipping register has been achieved without compromising quality standards. The Maritime & Coastguard Agency ( MCA ) have appointed dedicated customer account managers to assist with enquiries throughout the registration process. This - and removing excess regulation - has made the UK flag more attractive. The tonnage tax was introduced in the Finance Act 2000. Shipping companies can opt into tonnage tax, or stay in the current corporate tax regime. Tonnage tax applies normal corporation tax to notional profits determined by the tonnage of the ships operated. It brings certainty and clarity about tax liabilities and is used by a number of other EEA countries, including Germany, the Netherlands, Greece and Norway. The tonnage tax is enabling British shipping to be more internationally competitive. A feature of the UK tonnage tax is the minimum training obligation. This normally requires each shipping company in the tax to recruit and train one officer trainee each year for every 15 officer posts in its fleet, and to give consideration to employment and training opportunities for ratings.

/guidance/inland-waterways-types-of-vessels,"Guidance about the types of vessels that can operate on UK inland waters. It also refers to EU requirements and regulations. Inland waterways: types of vessels Inland waterways Construction, maintenance and operation standards Maritime and Coastguard Agency Overview This guidance is for the owners and operators of: passenger ships non-passenger vessels pleasure boats These are the three main types of vessel that can operate on UK inland (categorised) waters. The guidance gives some further details about each type of vessel, and the relevant requirements for them whether they are UK vessels in UK waters, UK vessels in EU waters, or EU vessels in UK waters. UK inland waterways: passenger ships Passenger ships are ships that carry more than 12 passengers. On inland waters there are three different types of passenger ships: Class IVs and Class Vs ships complying with the safety code for passenger ships (MSN 1823) passenger ships from other EU states operating on UK categorised waters Class IVs and Vs Class IVs and Class Vs are existing passenger ships built before 2010. There are a lot of regulations and standards which apply to them, so you might need to engage a marine consultant to identify what requirements are applicable to your vessel. Where there is a doubt about the application of a specific regulation you can contact your local MCA Marine Office for clarification. MSN 1823 applies to ships built after 6 April 2010, and also to: ships built after that date, and which have never been certified as a UK passenger ship previously passenger ships which were Class IV or Vs previously, but which have been laid up for more than 5 years. UK inland waterways: non-passenger vessels Non-passenger vessels are generally: freight vessels tug boats workboats that work on inland waterways These are classed as Class IX(A) ships. Under the UK’s vessel classification system: Class IX(A) covers non sea-going freight vessels and all non-passenger vessels Class IX(A)(T) covers non sea-going tankers MGN 469 gives further information on the regulations that apply to non-passenger vessels. In addition, the Inland Waters Small Passenger Boat Code provides a national standard for small commercial vessels carrying up to 12 passengers. These vessels are not classified as passenger vessels in accordance with Merchant Shipping legislation using categorised waters. EU states: passenger and non-passenger vessels If passenger and non-passenger vessels from other EU states are operating on UK categorised waters, they need to comply with MSN 1824 . It refers to EU Directive 2006/87/EC as amended, and gives the full technical requirements for inland waterways vessels: MIN 467 provides information on amendments to directive 2006/87/EC laying down technical requirements for inland waterway vessels UK inland waterways: pleasure vessels A pleasure vessel is: used by its owner only for fun or sport not used for the owner’s financial gain For a full legal definition of pleasure vessels, read Regulation 2 of the Merchant Shipping (Vessels in Commercial Use for Sport or Pleasure) Regulations 1998, SI 1998/2771 If a vessel doesn’t fall under this description it’s not considered a pleasure vessel - so the rules for commercial vessels will then apply. Pleasure boats have very few national rules, as long as they carry no more than 12 passengers. They’d then be considered passenger ships and the relevant rules will apply. MGN 489 (amended) details the regulations that apply to pleasure boats. Pleasure boats: licensing requirements If you are operating a pleasure craft on the inland waters network, such as a: motor cruiser sailing cruiser narrow boat houseboat you may need to be registered with the relevant navigation authority, and hold an appropriate licence. Contact the local navigation authority for information about the registration and licensing arrangements for your area. Operating a UK vessel on EU inland waters Some UK vessels may operate on European inland waterways. They must have: a European Vessel Identification Number (ENI) from the Royal Yachting Association a Union Inland Navigation Certificate (UINC) You’ll receive the UINC when a survey on your vessel has been completed, in line with the directive requirements. Arrange a vessel survey through the relevant waterway authority. You’ll need the ENI to enter on the UINC. Read MSN 1824 for more relevant information."

New state award for a Merchant Navy Medal for Meritorious Service  Maritime and Coastguard Agency Department for Transport Thank you Admiral Lord West, Captain Matthew Easton and the rest of the Merchant Navy Medal Fund Committee for inviting me to say a few words. It’s an honour to be here. And what better place for such a ceremony than Trinity House, steeped in maritime history. First I would like to congratulate this year’s recipients of the Merchant Navy Medal. It is a prestigious accolade. Sometimes people forget how important merchant seafarers and fishers are to our island nation. So it is right that they are recognised for the vital role they play in often difficult and dangerous conditions. Today’s medals are particularly special as they are the last set awarded by the Merchant Navy Medal Fund. Back in 2011, the Fund began a campaign for a medal that is granted a place in the order of wear. Two years later, Her Majesty the Queen approved a recommendation to introduce such a medal - a state award with a place in the order of wear. And earlier this year, the Royal Warrant was signed. Throughout this period, the Merchant Navy Medal Fund Committee worked closely with the Department for Transport and although it has taken some time to get to this point; these things are never as straightforward as they appear. I am delighted to announce today that from 2016 we will have a new state award for a Merchant Navy Medal for Meritorious Service with a place in the order of wear. The first awards will be announced on Merchant Navy Day – 3rd September 2016. May I take this opportunity to thank the Merchant Navy Medal Fund Committee for the work they have done in recognising the outstanding service of those who have been awarded Merchant Navy Medals over the past 10 years. Nominations for the first awards of the new Medal for Meritorious Service will open today. The present committee, with its deep understanding of all aspects of the merchant shipping and fishing industries, will continue to work in an advisory capacity. So let me finish by thanking you all once again for your contribution. For your recognition of seafarers’ achievements over the past decade. And for your work with the Department for Transport, which has culminated in today’s announcement; a new Merchant Navy Medal for Meritorious Service. Thank you."

/government/speeches/government-is-committed-to-uk-maritime-growth,"The Royal Yachting Association upholds maritime standards, but it also contributes to our maritime economy. Government is committed to UK maritime growth  Maritime and Coastguard Agency Department for Transport I am delighted to have been given the opportunity to address the Royal Yachting Association at the Boat Show today (13 January 2016). The Royal Yachting Association is renowned the world over for its regard for maritime safety and its determination to maintain seafaring standards, while this year’s boat show has the distinction of being the third occasion in 4 months that the eyes of the maritime world have been on London. Last September saw the second ever London International Shipping Week. It was a landmark event for the shipping industry, for the UK, and for every one of the dozens of maritime nations that participated. London International Shipping Week was also the week that Lord Mountevans’s seminal Maritime growth study was published. It was the first comprehensive review of UK’s maritime sector in 20 years. And I know the association and many others here made important contributions to the maritime growth study, so this is a great opportunity to give you an update. One thing the maritime growth study made very clear was the importance of the marine and maritime sectors to the UK. They directly contribute at least £11 billion a year to the economy, while supporting over 113,000 jobs and six and a half thousand businesses. Nonetheless, the study concluded that there is still much we can achieve. World sea trade is expected to double by the year 2030, and maritime centres in Europe and the Far East are undergoing rapid growth as they seek to emulate our historic success. So the government and the maritime industry must work together to strengthen the UK’s position in an ever-more-competitive global market. With that in mind, on 16 December 2015 I published the government’s formal response to the maritime growth study. We agreed to accept its findings, and I am pleased to report today some of the changes that are now underway. First, we formed, and in November held the first meeting of, a new Ministerial Working Group for Maritime Growth. The membership comprises ministers from across government. Several industry invitees also attended the meeting, including representatives from Maritime UK and the Marine Industries Leadership Council. We discussed how to get more investment in our maritime industries, how to increase our exports, and how to seize the opportunities presented by apprenticeships. Next, the government is to review the numbers of British seafarers and the skills our country needs to secure maritime growth. If necessary, we will look at the levels of support for maritime training funding to ensure it remains fit for purpose. And we are also responding to Lord Mountevans’s recommendations concerning the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, and, in particular, its UK Ship Register . It’s great that, in tonnage terms, the register has had a year of modest growth. But we want that trend to continue. So we have appointed Simon Barham to be the MCA ’s new director of the UK Ship Register. Simon will be primarily focused on attracting owners of quality ships to sign up to the UK Flag and working to secure the long-term commercial success of the UK Ship Register. He brings 40 years of maritime experience to the task from a varied career in the industry. Meanwhile, the MCA is reforming its survey and inspection function to make it more flexible, efficient and customer-focused. In the longer-term, we will look to build on these changes and continue to make the MCA , and the services it provides, more responsive and commercially focused. We are exploring what more can be done to ensure that the ship register has the flexibility and capability to compete with the best in the world – making full use of the findings of the maritime growth study and UK Ship Register Advisory Panel. And we agree with Lord Mountevans that the MCA would benefit from the additional leadership and guidance that could be provided by a non-executive chair, so we are going to recruit someone who can bring the necessary commercial experience to continue these reforms and support the work of MCA . Altogether there’s a lot happening in response to the maritime growth study. But the recreational side of the maritime industry is just as important to the UK economy as the more directly commercial side. The UK has cutting-edge expertise in the design and manufacture of sailing yachts, superyachts, and high-end powerboats. Anyone requiring further evidence of this need only take a look around this year’s show. The government is clear that growth in these industries is part-and-parcel of the growth we want to see in the whole maritime sector. That is why we are so grateful to the association for contributing to the maritime growth study, and for how it has continued to contribute now we are implementing the recommendations. So in conclusion, I would like to say thank you to the Royal Yachting Association for your support for what we are trying to achieve for the sector. Thank you for another year of working to support seafarers, sportsmen and women and recreational sailing throughout the UK and beyond. And thank you for hosting today’s reception. I trust that 2016 will be another year of success for the association and all its members — whether in sport or in commerce. Thank you."

Government gives £915,000 boost to water rescue charities  Department for Transport Maritime and Coastguard Agency Almost £1 million has been awarded by Maritime Minister Robert Goodwill today (18 February 2016) to 51 UK charities to support water rescue services in local communities. The government scheme gives voluntary groups crucial funding for new equipment and training to support their rescue efforts on and around inland and inshore waterways. The money is for the purchase of lifeboats, launch vehicles, rafts and safety gear, as well as going towards training and other costs to support lifesaving efforts. This is the second year of the 5 year scheme. In January 2015 more than £800,000 was awarded to 21 charities across the UK. Details of those who have shared the £1.7 million government funding over the last 2 years has been published. Inshore and inland rescue boat grant scheme funding recipients, 2014 to 2016 Maritime Minister Robert Goodwill, who is also the Ministerial Flood Recovery Envoy for Yorkshire, said: “This funding recognises the enormous efforts of voluntary rescue boat teams and their tireless work in providing 24/7 services during emergencies and extreme weather. “These groups often rely on charitable donations to sustain their operations. This additional funding will make a real difference to them and the communities they serve, enabling them to buy the essential equipment and training which will save more lives and keep crews safe.” An expert panel — including representatives from the devolved administrations, Defra, the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, Royal National Lifeboat Institution, and the Royal Yachting Association — assessed applications submitted to the Department for Transport under the 2015 to 2016 round of the scheme on the basis of: how the equipment or training will be used to support lifesaving, search and rescue operations and flood response capability locally and nationally whether the funding will deliver wider community benefits how the equipment and skills will bring sustainable benefits Bids for funding were accepted from UK charities as defined in the Charities Act 2006. Other criteria are set out in the guidance notes published on GOV.UK . The annual £1 million fund also covers administration of the scheme. List of new grant recipients !@1 [Contact:1015]"

UK Transport Minister Robert Goodwill pays tribute to Northern Ireland’s water rescue services  Department for Transport Northern Ireland Office Maritime and Coastguard Agency UK Transport Minister Robert Goodwill was in Northern Ireland today (25 February 2016) to meet search and rescue crews and hear how funding awarded over the last couple of years, most recently last week, is protecting people from drowning. He met volunteers from Lough Neagh Rescue in Antrim and Lagan Search and Rescue in Belfast. Lough Neagh Rescue has received more than £70,000 since the UK government’s rescue boat fund was launched in 2014 to 2015. Lagan Search and Rescue has received more than £85,000. The money has purchased rescue vessels, personal protection equipment and training. The minister was then joined by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Theresa Villiers, as they visited the Belfast Coastguard Operations Centre and the Marine Office in Bangor. They received a briefing on the work the coastguards, volunteers and other marine staff do and were given a tour of the operations centre. Robert Goodwill said: “It was a pleasure to meet search and rescue crews, coastguards and other marine staff in Northern Ireland. I can’t thank them enough for the professionalism and commitment they show every day, year after year, often risking their own lives, to keep people safe. I was very pleased to hear that a rescue boat funded through last year’s UK government grant to Lough Neagh Rescue was used to save a canoeist’s life while out on the very first training exercise. Thanks to the bravery of staff and volunteers, the equipment we have funded this year will help keep people safe for many years to come.” Details of the charities who have shared the £1.7 million UK government rescue boat funding over the last 2 years can be found on GOV.UK . This is the second year of the 5 year scheme. [Contact:1015]"

This directive is due to come into force on 1st July 2016. This consultation does not cover any work on the directive for land-based industry as this is being taken forward by The Health and Safety Executive and the Department for Employment and Labour, Northern Ireland. The EMF directive lays down minimum requirements for the protection of workers from risks to their health and safety arising, or likely to arise, from exposure to EMFs with frequencies up to 300 gigahertz. It requires duty holders to assess the levels of EMF to which their workers may be exposed against a set of specific thresholds. Employers will have a responsibility to ensure that employees are not exposed to electromagnetic field levels in excess of the ELVs. Employers will be responsible for carrying out a suitable and sufficient assessment of the levels of electromagnetic fields to which employees may be exposed."

The UK Search and Rescue Helicopter Service has operated out of Lydd Airport on a temporary basis since August 2015. The decision to make this arrangement permanent will enable the operators, Bristow Helicopters Ltd , to push ahead with plans to build a new £7 million search and rescue helicopter hangar at the airport. The new hangar will house 2 state-of-the-art search and rescue helicopters that will operate a lifesaving service around the clock. Transport Minister Robert Goodwill said: “The UK Coastguard’s Search and Rescue Team in Lydd already play a vital role in emergency lifesaving operations in the south-east and the decision to make this the permanent base for the service will be much welcomed by the crew and the operator. “This will give the crew real certainty about their future with the service, allowing them to put down roots in the local community, and will allow Bristow Helicopters Ltd to push ahead with their plans to build a new, state-of-the-art facility.” The Maritime and Coastguard Agency and its contractor Bristow Helicopters will be working closely with the airport owners and the local community at Lydd over the coming months as the development of this new facility starts.

/guidance/seafarers-medical-certification-guidance,"How to get an ENG1 or ML5 medical certificate. Seafarers: medical certification guidance Medical certification and advice Maritime and Coastguard Agency Overview As a seafarer, it’s important that you are fit for the job you are doing on a day-to-day basis, and during emergencies. A medical examination will find out if you have a health condition that could result in you needing urgent treatment, or potentially put fellow crew or passengers’ lives at risk. If you are employed on a ship, and it’s your normal place of work, then regulations require you to have a medical examination. This is to prove that you are in good enough health and fitness to carry out your duties. This guide tells you which of the two medical certificates you need, how to get it, and where to find a doctor to carry out a medical fitness examination. It also tells you what to do if you fail, and want to get your result reviewed. What is a ‘seafarer’? The Maritime Labour Convention ( MLC ) states: A seafarer is any person, including a master, who is employed or engaged or works in any capacity on board a ship and whose normal place of work is on a ship. Seafarers and other crew members: which medical certificate do you need? You need a seafarer medical certificate ( ENG1 ) if you are: in charge of a ship, e.g. ship’s captain serving on a merchant ship a seafarer Any seafarer on board a ship must have an ENG1 (or equivalent) to work on a merchant vessel, or for any UK Certificate of Competency (CoC). You need an ML5 medical report and certificate if you are: master of a non-seagoing passenger ship (Class IV or V) master of a commercial non-seagoing vessel master and crew of a small commercial vessel (under 24 metres, carrying no more than 12 passengers, going no more than 60 miles from shore) crew or other employee (like a steward, security guard, caterer) on a domestic seagoing passenger ship (Class VI or VI(A)). This has to be your normal place of work. You don’t need either certificate if you are employed: on a fishing vessel on a non-commercial pleasure vessel on an offshore installation while on its working station on-shore as your normal place of work and/or working during a voyage on a short-term, one-off or temporary basis in roles like: a guest lecturer a research scientist riding crew a pilot a trainee or a volunteer on a sail training ship (carrying out non safety-critical role) ENG 1 and Maritime Labour Convention ( MLC ) compliance The ENG 1 has been MLC compliant since 2010, when the medical standards were changed. A new merchant shipping notice (MSN) was then published. MSN 1839 is the most current notice. This notice also applies if you want to have an independent medical review after failing the ENG1 . MCA are satisfied that the ENG1 is MLC compliant, because the medical examination and certification system meets the MLC ’s requirements of: appointing and training approved doctors (ADs) validity of certificates your right to appeal the AD ’s decision if you’re unhappy with it checking your ID the scope of the medical, such as checking your colour vision and (as of 2010) your hearing Read the ‘Merchant Shipping (Maritime Labour Convention) (Medical Examination) Regulations’ . Seafarers getting an ENG1 : find an MCA AD to carry out your ENG1 Search MCA ’s current list of ADs in the UK. Search MCA ’s current list of ADs overseas and in international territories. Search MCA ’s current list of Doctors who were previously approved. All lists are updated regularly. Seafarers getting an ENG1 equivalent: find countries whose certificates are accepted on UK flag vessels Each country has a list of its own ADs. To get a certificate that’s been assessed as equivalent to ENG1 , you must contact the relevant country’s own maritime authority. They’ll give you the locations of their own ADs. The list updates annex A of MSN 1815 , which lists the countries that can issue equivalent certificates. It’s updated as and when medical standards and systems have been assessed for equivalency. List of ENG 1 equivalent countries Austria Lithuania Australia Luxembourg Belgium Malta Bulgaria Mauritius Canada Netherlands - List of Approved Doctors to issue Netherlands medical fitness certificates Croatia New Zealand Cyprus Norway - List of Approved Doctors to issue Norwegian medical fitness certificates Czech Republic Pakistan Denmark* Poland Estonia Portugal Finland Republic of Ireland France Romania Germany Slovakia Greece Slovenia Hong Kong South Africa Hungary Spain Iceland Sri Lanka India Sweden Italy Ukraine Jamaica   Latvia   If you are based overseas and are not in of one of the countries above, you could obtain a statutory seafarers medical fitness certificate from one the countries with a ‘List of Approved Doctors attached’. These maritime administrations have doctors based overseas that can issue statutory seafarers medical certificates that are equivalent to an ENG 1. Please note the certificate issued will not be an ENG 1 certificate. For example Norwegian Maritime Authority have approved doctors in Italy, USA, Nigeria and more, who can issue a Norwegian Seafarers Medical Fitness Certificate. The Netherlands Maritime authority have approved doctors in Russia, Saint-Martin, Indonesia and more, who can issue a Dutch Seafarers Medical Fitness Certificate. *Please note: The Danish seafarers’ medical fitness certificate is only valid with a completed booklet ‘Health Certificate for Seafarers and Fishermen’, issued by the Danish Maritime Authority. ENG1 ADs for companies and healthcare providers See the list of ADs at healthcare providers who carry out seafarer medical examinations for employers. MCA is legally obliged to publish the provers’ and the doctors’ names. Find ENG1 ADs for companies This list of company ADs is for any seafarer employed by one of the companies listed, and needs to have an ENG1 medical. Your ENG1 or ML5 medical: what to take with you Although you’ll be told what to take when you make your appointment, don’t forget: your current ENG1 certificate or equivalent any medication you’re taking any glasses or contact lenses you‘re using, and spares the name and telephone number of your doctor (general practitioner; GP) any reports or letters from your GP, if you’ve recently been to hospital or under a consultant an official form of ID that has a photo: a passport, a photocard driving licence, an official student pass with photo (for new entrants), a discharge book It’s important that you tell the approved doctor if: you have failed the ENG1 examination you have been issued with restrictions you failed to complete an ENG1 examination with another AD If you don’t, it can be seen as ‘doctor shopping’ - and could invalidate your ENG1 . Your ENG1 medical: What it covers and what happens The ENG1 medical fitness certificate standards are based on these international guidelines: Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW) MLC Internal Maritime Organization (IMO)/International Labour Organization (ILO) guidelines on medical examinations of seafarers The most important conditions that can affect fitness are: heart attack (coronary thrombosis) problems with the heart rhythm home forms of heart surgery heart or artery disease lung disease causing shortness of breath diabetes treated with insulin (Type 1 or 2) stroke unexplained loss of consciousness epilepsy severe head injury or brain surgery treatment for mental or nervous problems alcohol or drug addiction problems severe deafness or difficulty communicating by radio or telephone eyesight or colour vision that does not meet standards transplants: heart, kidney or other organs; joint replacement; limb prostheses conditions that can cause sudden incapacity conditions that put you at increased risk of illness while in charge of a vessel (remote from assistance) conditions that limit mobility and stamina (under normal and emergency conditions) medication with side effects that reduce performance or alertness – and can cause complications while in charge of a vessel During your ENG1 medical you’ll be: asked about your medical history by the doctor or a practice nurse weighed and measured asked to provide a urine sample tested on your hearing and sight (for distance, colour and near vision) given a physical examination (you will be asked to undress to your underclothes) Your ENG1 medical results At the end of the ENG1 examination, the AD will issue you with a certificate of fitness. This can certify you as: fit without restrictions (unrestricted) fit with restrictions (e.g. limiting your work to certain jobs or locations), temporarily or permanently unfit If you pass the ENG1 , you’ll get your certificate usually on the day of the examination. You won’t get your ENG1 certificate on the same day if the doctor has any concerns about your fitness, and needs to get additional medical information or seek advice from MCA chief medical adviser. You’ll get a ‘temporarily unfit certificate’ if there’s likely to be a delay in the doctor’s final decision. What to do if you’re found ‘permanently unfit’ for your ENG1 A ‘permanently unfit’ result stands for at least five years. If you want or need to have another ENG1 medical in the next five years, you must show clinical evidence proving the condition that caused this result has been reversed. The AD will give you a ‘notice of Failure/Restriction (ENG 3)’ form if: you are found unfit, or your ENG1 is restricted The ENG 3 will tell you what to do if you want to have an independent medical review. If you want to have an independent medical review You must contact MCA Seafarer Health and Safety Branch within one month of the ENG3 being issued. MCA will cover the cost of your review – but you will have to pay your own travel expenses. You will be examined by an independent medical referee. What you need to take to your independent medical review: a passport or discharge book job description for your current or most recent job your restricted ENG1 , if you have been issued one the medical paperwork relevant to your current condition or state of health, especially letters from your consultant(s) or GP To help the referee decide if the original decision of fitness was sound, they can also ask for: additional testing to be done additional specialist opinions The referee will take all of this information into account, and make a final assessment of your fitness. Please note: the referee has a level of discretionary power above the AD ’s, but they’re still bound by the medical fitness standards in MSN 1839. If all the evidence supports it, the referee can issue you with a revised ENG1 certificate. Their decision is final - they won’t overturn the AD ’s original decision just because you have asked for a review. List of MCA medical referees ENG1 additional colour vision tests Seafarers: what happens if you fail an Isihara plate screening Deck department: Contact MCA for a lantern test. This can be done in Southampton, Aberdeen, or Beverley marine offices, and City University in London. You will need to pay any travel costs, but the lantern test is free of charge if you are a seafarer. The AD will normally wait for the result to come back before completing the ENG1 certificate. You’ll be issued an unrestricted ENG1 if: you pass the lantern test and have no other medical conditions that can affect your fitness to work at sea If you fail the lantern test you’ll be issued an ENG1 with the restriction ‘not fit for lookout duties’, and the certificate will be ticked ‘not fit for lookout duties’. You’ll get a letter from the marine office to confirm this result. Take this with you to your next and future examinations. The AD will make sure that information, and any colour vision restrictions, are on your new certificate. New entrant deck candidates: You’ll be unable to get a CoC as a deck officer. If you decide, after career advice, not to pursue another seafaring career, you’ll be issued an ENG3 Cat 4 ‘permanently unfit’. Engineering department: Your AD will need to arrange a City University or Farnsworth D15 colour vision test for you. If you pass either the City University or the Farnsworth D15 colour vision test you’ll be issued an unrestricted ENG1 . This is if you have no other conditions that can affect your fitness to work at sea. If you fail the City University or Farnsworth D15 colour vision test you’ll be issued an ENG1 with the restriction ‘not fit for work with colour coded cables or equipment’. It will be ticked ‘not fit for lookout duties’. Other departments such as catering or hotel If you fail the colour vision test you’ll be issued an ENG1 with the restriction ‘not fit for lookout duties’. It’ll be ticked ‘not fit for lookout duties’. Maritime security guards: read the guidance for maritime security guards and their employers. The cost of an ENG1 or ML5 The cost of an ENG1 The most you should pay for an ENG1 is £80. If you are employed in the UK, your employer will pay this. The £80 limit is set in regulations, and MCA review this from time to time. If you need any extra tests (like a step test), the approved doctor can charge more. This must be agreed with whoever is paying for the ENG1 before you have the test(s). The cost of an ML5 There is no set price for the ML5. It isn’t regulated by MCA , as it’s considered a private transaction. Ask your doctor how much the ML5 will cost before they complete your report. Guidance for seafarers and other crew getting an ML5 certificate You don’t need an AD to carry out your ML5 medical. You can print the ML5 form and certificate , or also get your form from: the Royal Yachting Association ( RYA ) your local Marine Office . Take the ML5 report form to any doctor registered with GMC (General Medical Council) , and with a valid licence to practice. The doctor will complete your ML5 certificate if: there are no ticks in the ‘yes’ box (this shows there might be a medical problem) there are no other notes on medical conditions You can then send this with your application for issue or revalidation of a boatmaster’s licence ( BML ) or RYA commercial endorsement. You won’t get an ML5 certificate if you’re found, during the medical examination, to have any type of condition which may make you unfit for service - and the box is ticked to show this. The completed report and blank certificate will be returned to you. What happens if your doctor can’t issue your ML5 certificate If you want to continue with your BML or commercial endorsement application, you’ll need to complete part D of the ML5 report. Send or take it to your local MCA marine office or the RYA , depending on which of them is dealing with your application. This will then be reviewed by an MCA medical assessor. They’ll issue your ML5 certificate if they find you fit for sea service, but this certificate may be subject to restrictions. Your ML5 certificate will be sent back to you through the RYA or MCA Marine office. They can decide to issue you a restricted RYA endorsement or BML . This can limit your work to certain jobs or locations, or place operational restrictions on your licence. Seafarers with ENG1s who also need UK Oil and Gas ( UKOG ) medical certificates A UKOG medical certificate isn’t equivalent to an ENG1 , as they are two separate medicals which serve two different purposes: UKOG is an employer’s medical. Its medical standards have been produced to meet the needs and requirements of the employer. ENG1 is statutory - it’s required by law for all seafarers working on board a UK flagged vessel. Seafarers who need both UKOG certificates and ENG1s If you need to have both the ENG1 and the UKOG medicals, check MCA ’s list of ADs and the UKOG list of approved doctors before making your appointment. You could find one doctor to carry out both at the same time.

/government/news/press-release-new-way-of-working-for-survey-and-inspection-programme,"Plans to make sure there is a full maritime survey and inspection team covering the whole UK, will see more remote working and a slight change to where some of the marine offices are based. Press release: New way of working for survey and inspection programme Surveys and inspections Maritime and Coastguard Agency The Maritime & Coastguard Agency has undertaken a review of the way it carries out its surveys and inspections and recently consulted on the locations of its marine offices. It has also, with its staff, reviewed the way the organisation of those offices is structured. As a result of both consultations, changes have been made to the original proposals including keeping two offices open that were originally marked for closure and identifying a senior experienced marine surveyor who will have over-arching responsibility for the River Thames. The proposals save more than a third of a million pounds in terms of estate costs. Belfast, Liverpool, Cardiff Aberdeen, Plymouth, Southampton, Beverley (Hull) and Glasgow Marine Offices will remain open and a new office will be opened in the Colchester/Ipswich area. These will form the main Marine Office hubs. Dover, Falmouth and Milford Haven will be satellite bases attached to the main marine office hubs from where they will be managed – Southampton, Plymouth and Cardiff respectively. The Tyne office will close along with Harwich, Norwich and Orpington. These changes are part of a much larger transformation programme for its survey and inspection business to improve customer service and efficiency. The proposals, which have been approved by the Executive Board of the MCA, will save money with minimal impact on the MCA survey and inspection work force. Sir Alan Massey, Chief Executive said: ‘This programme marks an exciting moment for the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. The MCA’s marine surveyors are a vital part of our business and have built an outstanding reputation for their technical skills and professionalism. Yet the maritime world is changing, and we have to move with the times. ‘For example, we’ve had great difficulty in recruiting and retaining marine surveyors; and our customers are also - and rightly - demanding more responsive services that are fit for a competitive world market in the digital age. We need to address those things squarely. Modernising our approach, in terms of both the geographical location of our offices and the way our surveyors work, offers us a positive, efficient way forward. ‘We have consulted widely with our staff and external customers in coming to these decisions. The MCA is and remains committed to the highest standards in upholding maritime safety throughout our areas of responsibility: UK-wide and indeed globally. This transformation programme will greatly help us to achieve that.’ Katy Ware, Director of Maritime Safety and Standards and overseeing the plans for the Survey and Inspection Transformation Programme, said: ‘We understand that people might be worried about the future but we have assured both our surveyors and staff that we will continue to work with them as the change programme moves forward. People matter in this Agency and we are committed to making sure we continue to act with that in mind.’ ‘We will work with all those staff affected on an individual basis, so we can help them with their transition plans.’ ‘I am mindful that we face some testing times ahead. However with the support of our diverse and highly experienced workforce I very much look forward to leading the Directorate of Maritime Safety and Standards as it develops to deliver a service that ensures we meet the expectations of our stakeholders and allows staff to develop themselves.’"

This Notice has been amended to take into account changes to the table of requirements in Annex 1. This note provides further guidance to owners and operators of Domestic Passenger Ships on how to comply with the Audit and Self-Assessment requirements of the Safety Management Code for Domestic Passenger Ships as set out in the amended Merchant Shipping Notice MSN 1869(M). Whilst the Code itself remains substantially unchanged the frequency of the audits are very different and are intended to more closely follow the ISM format, but applied in a more pragmatic way. Key points: There is a requirement for the MCA to carry out a company or office audit and that some preparation work is required for the same. The On board Audits, whilst less frequent, shall also be pre-planned and operators will be required to demonstrate compliance with the code including emergency preparedness. There is a requirement for Companies to carry out Self-Assessments to review their own systems. This Guidance also takes the opportunity to explain how companies should undertake the annual Self-Assessment and a review of the safety management system at intervals not exceeding three years.

If you would like to make an application to have your container weight method approved by the MCA please click here For the public database of MCA approved weighers please click here Please note, due to force majeure Ecuador has advised they will be delaying their instigation of the container weight requirements for containers shipped from their ports until further notice. 1. MGN 534 Guidance on the implementation of the SOLAS VI Regulation 2 amendment requiring the verification of the gross mass of packed containers is found within MGN534. This MGN outlines the position in the UK with regard to the amendments to SOLAS VI which took effect from 1st July 2016. It also highlights detailed guidance for UK shippers, terminals/ports and carriers on implementing the SOLAS VI provisions. As a result of working with industry and other stakeholders in producing MGN 534, it was considered that the background documents and other information should not be published as part of the MGN but be made available through this webpage. The list of topics below, is not exhaustive, and the information described below are of an informative nature. It is expected that they will be added or edited as the UK’s experience of applying the new SOLAS provisions progresses. 2. Verification Methods The shipper is responsible for providing a VGM to the carrier. In the UK there are two methods of verifying the gross mass of a container. Given below is how the UK has implemented both methods. Method 1 Weighing the packed and sealed container. Using weighbridges, or lifting equipment fitted with load cells, or other appropriate weighing equipment to determine the verified gross mass (VGM) of a loaded container. Calculations may be used as part of the method 1 process. Records must be kept to demonstrate the VGM provided represents the gross mass of the container. Method 1 users are not required to register with the MCA, however shippers must, upon request by the MCA or other body, provide evidence that the weighing equipment meets national standards appropriate to its class; is maintained by a competent person; is calibrated; is being operated correctly; and is safe. Records must be kept of maintenance and calibration procedures, including any corrective / remedial actions taken. Method 2 Method 2 involves a summation of the weight of the cargo, weight of pallets, dunnage (items used to secure the cargo etc.), and the tare weight of the container. A shipper using method 2 must have their method approved by the MCA. The UK Method 2 process was developed with the assistance of an industry working group with the aim of minimising bureaucracy whilst using shippers existing procedures. It should be noted, that the requirement to provide a gross mass has always been required, and the change is to the need to verify the weight is accurate. It is the shippers choice of which method is used. The shipper is responsible for providing a VGM to the carrier. A shipper may contract out the packing and the determination of the VGM of a container. The verified gross mass should be as accurate. The MCA has set an enforcement tolerance of ±5% or ±500kg, whichever is the greater value, to avoid disruption within the supply chain. This value is for enforcer’s guidance only and it is the shipper’s responsibility to be accurate. 3. Application Process If you would like to make an application to have your container weight method approved by the MCA please click here The fee for processing of the application is £94.00. Once the application has been received the MCA will reply with an application number and instructions on how to pay the fee.

SOLAS VI Regulation 2 amendment SOLAS CHAPTER VI CARRIAGE OF CARGOES AND OIL FUELS Part A General Provisions Regulation 2 – Cargo information The following new paragraphs 4 to 6 are added after existing paragraph 3: 4 In the case of cargo carried in a container*, except for containers carried on a chassis or a trailer when such containers are driven on or off a ro-ro ship engaged in short international voyages as defined in regulation III/3, the gross mass according to paragraph 2.1 of this regulation shall be verified by the shipper, either by: 4.1. weighing the packed container using calibrated and certified equipment; or 4.2. weighing all packages and cargo items, including the mass of pallets, dunnage and other securing material to be packed in the container and adding the tare mass of the container to the sum of the single masses, using a certified method approved by the competent authority of the State in which packing of the container was completed. 5 The shipper of a container shall ensure the verified gross mass** is stated in the shipping document. The shipping document shall be: 5.1. signed by a person duly authorized by the shipper; 5.2. submitted to the master or his representative and to the terminal representative sufficiently in advance, as required by the master or his representative, to be used in the preparation of the ship stowage plan*** 6 If the shipping document, with regard to a packed container, does not provide the verified gross mass and the master or his representative and the terminal representative have not obtained the verified gross mass of the packed container, it shall not be loaded on to the ship. The term “container” should be considered as having the same meaning as defined and applied in the International Convention for Safe Containers (CSC), 1972, as amended, taking into account the Guidelines for the approval of offshore containers handled in open seas (MSC/Circ.860) and the Revised Recommendations on harmonized interpretation and implementation of the International Convention for Safe Containers, 1972, as amended (CSC.1/Circ.138/Rev.1). ** Refer to the Guidelines regarding the verified gross mass of a container carrying cargo (MSC.1/Circ.1475). *** This document may be presented by means of EDP or EDI transmission techniques.

/government/consultations/draft-small-seagoing-passenger-ship-code,"This consultation covers the draft Small Seagoing Passenger Ship Code Draft Small Seagoing Passenger Ship Code  Maritime and Coastguard Agency The Draft Small Seagoing Passenger Ship Code has been developed for voluntary application to United Kingdom (UK) passenger ships of less than 24 metres load line length, carrying not more than 250 passengers, operating within 15 miles of a safe haven and no more than five miles from the coast. The Code provides opportunity for operators of ships to ply beyond the current Class VI plying limits by fully meeting the standards contained within this Code. Feedback is sought on all areas of the Code. The provisions of the Code have largely been drawn from EU directive regulations and the regulations pertaining to passenger ship operation on categorised waters. Since the Code is, at present, for voluntary application to existing vessels it is not considered that this represents a change to Regulation and an impact assessment has not been performed. Please provide any comments and feedback to Joanna Dormon at the contact details provided on the consultation letter, by the closing date of Friday 10th April 2015. Please also copy in Simon Milne at Simon.Milne@mcga.gov.uk in any response.

/government/consultations/mca-fees-consultation,"The Maritime & Coastguard Agency is holding a consultation on its proposal to raise ship survey fees, ship registration fees and merchant navy training costs. MCA fees consultation Construction, maintenance and operation standards Maritime and Coastguard Agency This consultation seeks to gather the views of people and organisations from the maritime sector on our proposal to raise our range of fees. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) is required to comply with the guidance set out in HM Treasury’s publication Managing Public Money. The full cost recovery norm for fees ensures Government neither profits at the expense of consumers nor makes a loss for taxpayers to subsidise. Since September 2006, the MCA has not changed its fee level and has consequently absorbed increases in ship registrations, ship surveys and merchant navy training costs. The recently published Maritime Growth Study identified full cost recovery as critical to improving the service provided by the MCA.

/government/publications/marine-pollution-marpol-annex-ii-surveyors,"Guidance concerning  International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL) Surveyors Marine Pollution (MARPOL) Annex II Surveyors Pollution prevention Maritime and Coastguard Agency MARPOL Annex II Surveyors The International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL 73/78) Annex II, Regulation 16 requires the Government of each party within the convention to appoint or authorise surveyors for the purposes of exercising control procedures developed by the International Maritime Organisation. The Merchant Shipping (Dangerous or Noxious Liquid Substances in Bulk) Regulations 1996 (Statutory Instrument (S.I.) 1996/3010, as amended by S.I. 1998/1153) implements Annex II of MARPOL and refers to MARPOL surveyors in Regulation 9(2). Duties of a MARPOL Surveyor A MARPOL Surveyor will only attend if required by a ship owner or his agent. The duties of a MARPOL Surveyor are briefly: To attend the completion of the unloading of all Category X substances and verify that the pre-wash has been conducted. To attend where the unloading of Category Y and Z substances cannot be carried out in accordance with the ship’s Procedures and Arrangements Manual. To attend vessels, such as “offshore supply vessels,” and verify that cargo tanks which have contained noxious liquid substances of pollution category X, Y or Z have been cleaned and the residues and washings have been put ashore to port waste reception facilities in accordance with the Procedures and Arrangements Manual. To exempt ships from the requirements of Regulation 13.4 of MARPOL ANNEX II, Exemption for a “pre-wash”, as required. If the pre-wash requirements cannot be met at the discharge port, but will be carried out at the next port, it is to confirmed in writing that a reception facility at the other port is available and is adequate for such purpose. To endorse each ship’s Cargo NLS Record Book accordingly. To provide prompt and accurate returns, using the returns form and including nil returns, every six months. Surveyor Operations When attending a vessel the MARPOL Surveyor should be supervised at all times by a responsible ships officer who is involved in cargo operations. The responsible ships officer should be present when any cargo sampling is carried out. He should be fully conversant with all aspects of the ship’s sampling system including the operational characteristics of the valves. The responsible ships officer should be satisfied that the sampling equipment is compatible with the ship’s sampling points before starting any sampling. The surveyor should only take samples from a designated sample point, as indicated by the ships officer. The sampling operations are to be conducted in a safe and efficient manner which will preclude any escape of cargo liquid or vapours to the atmosphere or the deck of the ship beyond that required by the sampling process. Any spillage is to be cleaned up immediately. The Surveyor should not be left unattended whilst taking samples. Fees for Undertaking MARPOL Surveyor Duties MARPOL Surveyors may charge for their services. The amount of any charges should be fixed by agreement between the Ship’s Master and Surveyor. Annual Registration of MARPOL Surveyors MARPOL Surveyors must re-register with the Maritime and Coastguard Agency(MCA) every year in order for the Authorisation to remain valid. It is the responsibility of the employing company to make sure that details of all authorised MARPOL Surveyors are sent to the MCA in the period from 1st to 31st October of each year. Failure to do so will result in the removal of the company and associated Surveyors from the List of Authorised MARPOL Surveyors. Re-registration should be undertaken using the re-registration form . Updating MARPOL Surveyors Information The Maritime and Coastguard Agency should be informed, at the address given at the bottom of this note, of any changes to the MARPOL Surveyor List. This includes changes: to the primary contact, company address details or the addition or loss of MARPOL surveyors to the company listed. Companies should not wait until the annual re-registration to inform the MCA of any changes. MARPOL Surveyors must inform the Maritime and Coastguard Agency if they change employer as this requires a new authorisation to be issued. Changes of this kind may be charged at the current hourly rate. If you do not inform the Maritime and Coastguard Agency of any changes like this it will result in MARPOL Surveyor Authorisation becoming invalid. Future Appointments Any application for appointment as a MARPOL Surveyor should be made to the address shown at the bottom of this page. Upon receipt of an enquiry regarding an application for Authorisation the MCA will send costs and details of the information required.

The changes are known as the 2014 amendments. We are seeking views on a proposal to update existing UK legislation to take account of these changes. The 2014 Amendments update the existing provisions to ensure the welfare of seafarers if they are abandoned by a ship owner, make financial security compulsory for ship owners to cover the costs of maintaining and repatriating abandoned seafarers and expand the existing provisions on shipowners liability for sickness injury or death in service to ensure that contractual compensation is paid in full and without delay to the seafarer or their representative. We also propose making some small corrections to the existing UK legislation implementing the MLC and one amendment which could reduce the liabilities of the ferry industry for wages in case of seafarer sick leave."

Dairy Producer Organisations Dairy and milk production Rural Payments Agency A group of dairy farmers in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland may apply to the Rural Payments Agency ( RPA ) to become a Dairy Producer Organisation ( DPO ). What is a DPO ? An organisation formed on the initiative of group of farmers, which has one or more aims. This includes negotiating contracts for the delivery of raw milk on behalf of its members. What are the potential benefits of becoming a DPO ? Negotiate on sales of larger volumes of raw milk than competition rules would normally allow, though limits still apply. Strengthen members’ position in the dairy supply chain. This means increased bargaining power and development of relationships across all parties in the supply chain. Negotiate a better price for the delivery of raw milk to processors or to a collector (for all their members). Make sure that production is planned and adjusted to demand, particularly in terms of quality and quantity; Optimise production costs and operating margins through: sharing knowledge sharing of best (dairy farming) practice benchmarking and improved individual farm management Able to explore different opportunities in the market. Give better customer service to milk purchasers Check the DPO requirements To be recognised by RPA , a DPO must: be formed on the initiative of dairy producers be formed from a minimum of 10 dairy producers (all of them must be separate legal entities) in the European Union ( EU ) or produce 6 million litres a year (2 producers needed) or both be a legal entity or a clearly defined part of a legal entity have a specific aim carry out activities properly and effectively have a statute that covers all of the above Contact Email: trader@rpa.gsi.gov.uk Telephone: 03300 416 500 Fax: 03300 416 501 Rural Payments Agency Dairy Producer Organisation Section Lancaster House Hampshire Court Newcastle upon Tyne NE4 7YH"

/guidance/milk-production-reduction-scheme-how-to-apply,"The Milk Production Reduction Scheme provides money to milk producers who volunteer to reduce their cows’ milk deliveries. Milk Production Reduction Scheme: how to apply Rural grants and payments Rural Payments Agency Latest news The application window for the second reduction period closed on 12 October – the application periods have now ended. Reduction requests, from 6,081 applicants from across the EU, totalled around 98,000 tonnes. Applications have exceeded the threshold for this scheme, so the European Commission (EC) has restricted the overall amount across the EU to just over 12,000 tonnes. This means that RPA will reduce the amounts applied for in the second reduction period, using a factor of 0.12462762, which the European Commission has published. If you applied for the second reduction period, RPA will write to you to confirm the maximum amount that you can claim for payment. There will be no further reduction periods for this scheme. If you applied for reduction periods 3 or 4, RPA will withdraw your application - you don’t need to do anything. How to claim for payments To claim for payments for the first reduction period (1 October to 31 December 2016), use form MPRS2 and make sure you submit it after 31 December 2016 and before 14 February 2017. To claim for payments for the second reduction period (1 November 2016 to 31 January 2017), use form MPRS2 and make sure you submit it after 31 January and before 17 March 2017. What is the Milk Production Reduction Scheme? The scheme – which is voluntary – provides money to milk producers who reduce the amount of cows’ milk they deliver to first purchasers during a 3-month period, known as the ‘reduction period’. This is compared with the same 3-month period in the previous calendar year, known as the ‘reference period’. There may be up to 4 reduction periods: 1 October to 31 December 2016 1 November 2016 to 31 January 2017 1 December 2016 to 28 February 2017 1 January to 31 March 2017 You will be paid €14.00/£11.87 per 100 kg (€14.42/£12.23 per 100 litres) for the amount of cows’ milk eligible for payment. The exchange rate is that set by the European Central Bank on 31 August 2016. If the scheme is over-subscribed in one or more reference periods, the volume of cows’ milk eligible for payment will be reduced. If one of the reduction periods is full or oversubscribed, the remaining reduction periods will be cancelled. If this happens, all applications for the remaining reduction periods will be rejected. Direct sales and milk from species other than cows are not part of the scheme. Who can apply? You can apply if you were delivering cows’ milk to a first purchaser in July 2016 and you were a milk producer in the reference period you’re applying for. To apply, you must plan to reduce your cows’ milk deliveries by at least 1,457 litres (1,500kg) in the relevant reduction period. The maximum you can apply for is a 50% reduction of the cows’ milk you produced in the reference period (even if you plan to reduce milk deliveries by more than 50%). If you apply for the first reduction period, you can also apply for the fourth reduction period. Otherwise, you can only apply for a single reduction period. You will need to be registered with RPA – see how to register for rural payments . How and when to apply Apply to join the scheme To apply to join the scheme, fill in an [InlineAttachment:1] and send it to the Rural Payments Agency (RPA). You must also send proof of the cows’ milk that you delivered to a first purchaser in: each month of the relevant reference period July 2016 Proof could be a copy of a milk cheque or purchaser statement for each of the relevant months. You can send photocopies. As this proof forms part of your application, you must send it with your application form. Without this proof, your application is incomplete and will be rejected. Deadlines for applications RPA must receive your application and proof by: first reduction period - 21 September 2016 at 11am second reduction period - 12 October 2016 at 11am third reduction period - 9 November 2016 at 11am fourth reduction period - 7 December 2016 at 11am RPA can’t accept late, incorrect or incomplete applications. Where to send forms and proof Send your completed form and proof to: Milk Production Reduction Scheme Rural Payments Agency Room 151 Lancaster House Hampshire Court Newcastle upon Tyne NE4 7YH How you’ll know if you’ve been accepted into the scheme RPA will write to you within 7 working days of the relevant application deadline to let you know if your application has been accepted or rejected. RPA will confirm the amount of reduction you can apply for payment on If your application is accepted, RPA will also confirm the amount of the reduction you can apply for payment on. This may be less than the volume in your application if: the scheme is over-subscribed in the reference period you applied for you applied for a reduction of more than 50% How to claim for payment If RPA accepts your application to join the scheme, you will need to fill in an [InlineAttachment:2] to claim your payment. Send it to the address shown in Where to send forms and proof . When to claim You can’t make a claim until the end of the relevant reduction period. RPA must then receive your completed claim form (MPRS2) and proof within 45 days of the end of the relevant reduction period. For example, for the first reduction period ending 31 December 2016, RPA must receive your claim for payment between 1 Jan and 14 Feb 2017. Send proof with your claim You must also send proof showing the total reduction made during the relevant reduction period. As this forms part of your claim, you must send it with your claim form. Without this proof, your claim is incomplete and will be rejected. Proof could be a copy of a milk cheque or purchaser statement for each of the relevant months. You can send photocopies. If you no longer produce cows’ milk and therefore you don’t have either milk cheques or purchaser statements, RPA will accept a letter from your purchaser confirming that no cows’ milk was delivered during one or more of the reduction months. Payments The maximum reduction you can claim payment on is the amount that RPA confirmed to you. Within this limit, RPA will pay you for the actual reduction in your deliveries of cows’ milk. If you don’t reduce your milk deliveries sufficiently, we will reduce your payment. You will receive: the full payment if the actual reduction is 80% or more of the amount we confirmed 80% of the payment if the actual reduction is 50% or more, but less than 80% of the amount we confirmed 50% of the payment if the actual reduction is 20% or more, but less than 50% of the amount we confirmed no payment if the actual reduction is less than 20% of the amount we confirmed Payment will be made direct to the bank account details RPA hold, normally within 90 days of the end of the reduction period.
