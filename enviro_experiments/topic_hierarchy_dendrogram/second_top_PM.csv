/government/news/twyford-seed-supplier-herbiseed-ltd-guilty-of-phytosanitary-certificate-fraud,"Twyford based seed supplier Herbiseed Ltd, pleaded guilty to the production and use of forged phytosanitary certificates.  Twyford seed supplier, Herbiseed Ltd, guilty of phytosanitary certificate fraud  Animal and Plant Health Agency Mr Stephen Morton, of Twyford based seed supplier Herbiseed Ltd, pleaded guilty to the production and use of forged phytosanitary certificates for seed export purposes at Reading Crown Court following a successful prosecution by the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra). The defendant received 3 concurrent prison sentences, suspended for 2 years, ranging from 12 to 24 months, and was ordered to undertake 300 hours unpaid community work. At a separate confiscation hearing on 29 July 2015, a confiscation order was made for just over £100,000 to be paid within three months. The penalty for non-payment is a 24-month prison sentence. Phytosanitary certificates are official documents that are usually required when exporting plants and plant material (including seed) to a country outside the EU. They are produced to recognised international standards to reassure importers that plant material has been inspected and found to be free of potentially damaging pests and diseases. Commenting on the outcome of the case, Mr Kelvin Hughes, Chief Plant Health and Seeds Inspector at the Animal and Plant Health Agency ( APHA ) said: The extent of the sentence received by Mr Morton reflects the serious nature of these offences. The use of fraudulent phytosanitary certificates could lead to damage to the importing country’s economy, agriculture and environment if plant pests or disease were present the imported goods, and could also damage associated UK trade with that country. By forging these certificates Mr Morton attempted to gain an advantage in both time and cost over compliant competitors. Our Plant Health and Seeds Inspectors work very closely with National Plant Protection Organisations in other countries and the success of this prosecution demonstrates that we have robust systems in place to help prevent and detect such fraudulent activities. Mr Morton was charged with 2 counts under the Fraud Act 2006 and one count under the Forgery & Counterfeiting Act 1981, relating to the forgery of 38 phytosanitary certificates for seed exports to Japan and the USA."
/guidance/sheep-scab,"How to spot sheep scab, what to do if you suspect it and control measures to prevent its spread. Sheep scab: how to spot and report the disease  Animal and Plant Health Agency Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs In Scotland sheep scab is a notifiable disease. That means if you suspect it you must tell the Animal and Plant Agency ( APHA ) immediately. Failure to do so is an offence. In England, Wales and Scotland local authorities can force you to treat your sheep or take other action if the disease is present in your flock and you don’t take appropriate steps. Sheep scab only affects sheep. Humans aren’t affected. The disease is currently present in Great Britain. How to spot sheep scab Sheep scab is caused by mites living in sheep’s fleeces or hair. The mites and their faeces cause intense itching which can lead to sheep: rubbing and scratching against fence posts nibbling and biting at their fleeces That means you should look out for: dirty areas of fleece from scratching hair, especially behind the shoulder clean areas of fleece, where sheep have nibbled broken areas of fleece on the sides of sheep from biting and scratching Affected sheep can be extremely sensitive to being touched. They may respond by nibbling. Affected sheep may also become dull and depressed and stand apart from the rest of the flock. Other skin conditions in sheep cause similar affects to sheep scab. You should seek advice from a vet as soon as possible. How sheep scab is spread Sheep scab is mainly spread by direct contact between sheep. The mites that cause the disease can also be picked up from fences, posts and trees that infected sheep rub against. Mites can also be spread on the clothing and equipment of sheep handlers. Preventing and controlling sheep scab Preventing sheep scab You should practise strict biosecurity on your premises. If you suspect sheep scab Prompt treatment is required. Contact your vet for advice. In Scotland you must also tell your nearest APHA office immediately. If sheep scab is confirmed Local authorities have the power to force you to treat your sheep or take other action if one of your animals has sheep scab and you do not take appropriate action. In Scotland a local authority or APHA inspector can also make you pay for a vet to inspect your sheep if he or she suspects the disease is present among your flock. Further information on prevention and control Controls to prevent disease What happens when a notifiable disease is suspected or confirmed Legislation relating to sheep scab The Sheep Scab Order 1997 gives local authorities powers to control the disease if owners of affected sheep don’t take appropriate measures voluntarily. The Sheep Scab (Scotland) Order 2010 makes the disease notifiable in Scotland."

You can get cover across the European Union from the Community Plant Variety Office instead of getting cover in the UK. If you get cover in the EU, you’ll need to suspend or surrender rights you already have in the UK for that particular variety. Read the guidance if you want to: add a new plant variety to the national list plant seeds that you’ve harvested in your own holding Who can apply You can apply for PBR if you’ve bred, discovered or developed a plant variety, or if you’ve been chosen by the breeder as their successor. Who can’t apply You can’t apply for rights of a plant you bred, discovered or developed for a company you’re employed by. Your employer can apply for the rights. What you can get rights for You can get rights for new plant varieties, including genetically modified varieties. To get rights, your variety must be: distinct – have different characteristics to other plants of the same species uniform – all plants in the variety must share the same characteristics stable – it remains unchanged after ‘repeated propagation’, eg reproduction from seeds, cuttings, bulbs or other plant parts You can register your variety in the UK if you’ve already registered it in a different country.

/government/speeches/richard-benyon-speech-at-ifaw-parliamentary-reception,"Thank you John for hosting today’s event and Robbie for your talk and support. Richard Benyon speech at IFAW Parliamentary reception  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Thank you John for hosting today’s event and Robbie for your talk and support.  This is an important issue that has cross-government support. In 1986 the whale was indeed saved. A moratorium on commercial whaling was introduced. A seminal moment in the world of conservation. A major environmental victory. Job done. Unfortunately that wasn’t the case. Although as a result of the moratorium the number of whales killed fell dramatically the likes of Norway, Iceland and Japan exploited some legal loopholes and continued to hunt. All three ignoring an internationally agreed moratorium on commercial whaling. Whether it is under the guise of lethal research or just blatant commercial whaling their continued hunting of these magnificent creatures is quite irresponsible. To make matters worse on the 22nd April this year the IWC looked to legitimise this hunt by proposing a compromise. Searching for some middle ground between those for hunting and those against. A compromise that allows whales to be hunted - but under a strict control of quotas. I have to say this move does fill me with a sense of deja vu. I’m sure we have been here before. Save the Whales - Again. This move by the IWC - I believe - will unpick the 1986 moratorium. It will scrap the good work that so many people have fought long and hard to achieve. It will heap more pressure on surviving whale populations who are having to combat a changing climate, marine pollution and incidental capture. It calls into question the international community’s commitment to protecting this planet for the future. But above all this move in effect condones an activity that is inherently, unacceptably and viciously cruel. An activity that remains highly emotive. Has a high media profile. And remains one of Defra’s biggest post bag issues. So for us our objectives in the immediate future are these: We strongly oppose moves to legitimise commercial whaling or introduce any new form of whaling; We support limited whaling operations by indigenous people for subsistence purposes and for local use only; We want to ensure that any whaling has a sound scientific basis and is based on the precautionary principle; We want to ensure that all whaling is for domestic use only and that restrictions on trade in whale products are maintained or strengthened; We want to look for a reduction in the number of whales taken for non-indigenous purposes from current levels phasing out to zero; We want to see an end to what is loosely termed “scientific whaling” outside IWC control; We want to ensure that any additional costs for monitoring, control and enforcement are met by whaling nations; And above all we oppose the reform proposals if they do not meet the key objectives stated above. As you can see this issue is of paramount importance to us - Whale are our environmental conscious.  Most great whale populations have still not recovered to the levels they were pre-exploitation. They are a permanent unaggressive and intelligent reminder of how mankind can totally devastate a species and hunt it to near extinction - with little regard for its welfare or the environmental consequences. So our position is clear. And later this month in Morocco at the annual IWC meeting we will spell it out again. The UK Government is for whales not whaling."
/government/consultations/the-future-of-the-agricultural-wages-board-for-england-and-wales-and-agricultural-wages-committees-and-agricultural-dwelling-house-advisory-committees-in-england,"In July 2010 the Government announced its decision to abolish these bodies. The future of the Agricultural Wages Board for England and Wales, Agricultural Wages Committees, Agricultural Dwelling House Advisory Committees  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Following the completion of the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act 2013, the Agricultural Wages Board was abolished on 25 June 2013. The current Agricultural Wages (England and Wales) Order 2012 remains in force until 30 September 2013. The National Minimum Wage will be introduced in the agricultural and horticultural sectors as from 1 October 2013. This means that until 1 October 2013 all agricultural and horticultural workers should continue to be remunerated in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Agricultural Wages Order 2012. The Agricultural Wages Order 2012 In July 2010 the Government announced its decision to abolish the Agricultural Wages Board for England and Wales, along with the Agricultural Wages Committees and the Agricultural Dwelling House Advisory Committees in England.  However, before taking a decision on the future of these bodies the government decided to seek the views of interested parties. The Government considers that by abolishing the Agricultural Wages Board, and hence the agricultural minimum wage regime, it will simplify employment practices and remove an unnecessary regulatory burden. This will enable the industry to adopt flexible working practices and help to ensure a sustainable and viable future for agriculture. Similarly it believes that given their reduced and limited functions it is difficult to justify the continued existence and public expense of the Agricultural Wages Committees and Agricultural Dwelling House Advisory Committees. Update 5 March 2013 – We have revised the figures of responses given in the overall summary as unfortunately a very small number of responses to the consultation exercise have come to light which were not included in the original analysis. These responses do not raise any substantive new arguments about the future of the Agricultural Wages Board and other committees, which have not already been considered by the Government. Given the very small number involved, the differences in the analysis are minimal and do not affect the overall percentages. Further information Employing farm workers"

/guidance/slaughter-poultry-livestock-and-rabbits-for-home-consumption,"How you can legally kill your own pigs, sheep, goats, cattle, poultry, rabbits and hares to eat at home. Slaughter poultry, livestock and rabbits for home consumption  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs You don’t need a licence to kill animals to eat at home, provided: you own the animal and you kill it on your property you’re killing it for you or your immediate family who live on your property to eat You could be prosecuted if you don’t follow the rules in this guide. You can’t kill animals in accordance with religious rites at home. Stun animals before killing You must always stun animals before killing. This is known as a ‘simple stun’, which makes an animal unconscious immediately but does not instantly kill it. Animals must remain unconscious until they’re dead. You must kill the animal immediately after you’ve stunned it - use a killing method like bleeding. Stunning animals If you kill an animal to eat on your property, you need to know how to: restrain, stun and kill the animal humanely and quickly avoid causing the animal any avoidable pain, distress or suffering Stunning poultry Cervical (neck) dislocation If you have no other method of stunning poultry available, you can stun birds up to 3kg by dislocating their necks by hand. You can kill up to 70 birds a day in this way. You can mechanically dislocate birds’ necks on birds up to 5kg. If birds weigh more than 5kg you must use another method such as electrical stunning. Bleeding poultry After you’ve stunned a bird, you must immediately cut the 2 carotid arteries in the neck properly so the bird bleeds out quickly and completely. You must make sure the animal dies quickly without regaining consciousness. You must wait until the bird is dead until you do anything to it, eg pluck it. You must wait for birds to bleed out for the following amounts of time: turkey or geese - at least 2 minutes other birds - at least 90 seconds Stunning rabbits and hares You must stun a rabbit or hare before bleeding it, using one of the following methods: a blow to the head, for rabbits that weigh 5kg or less penetrative captive bolt non-penetrative captive bolt, ie a bolt which doesn’t penetrate the skull but kills by percussion firearm with free projectile (like a shotgun) head-only electrical stunning using electric tongs head-to-body electrical stunning using electric tongs Bleeding rabbits After you’ve stunned rabbits, you must immediately cut both arteries in the neck, so they bleed quickly. They must remain unconscious until death. Stunning and killing pigs, sheep, goats, deer or cattle Restraining Unless you’re using a firearm to kill pigs, sheep, goats, deer or cattle, you must restrain them without causing them pain, suffering or distress. Stunning by penetrative captive bolt You can use a penetrative captive bolt device to stun any species but you need to then kill the animal after it’s unconscious. You must: check the bolt has retracted fully after each shot - if not, don’t use the device until it’s fixed shoot animals in the correct position - you must not shoot cattle or any bovine animals like bison or buffalo in the back of the head If you’re stunning sheep and goats with horns by penetrative captive bolt, you must: aim the shot just behind the base of the horns and towards the mouth bleed or kill an animal within 15 seconds of shooting it Stunning by non-penetrative captive bolt You can only use non-penetrative captive bolt devices to stun cattle, sheep and goats that weigh less than 10kg. You must apply the captive bolt in the proper position . Stunning using guns You can use a gun to stun and kill an animal but you must use the correct power and calibre of cartridge for the type of animal. Read the manufacturer’s instructions issued with your firearm to find this information. Stunning animals using electricity You can use electrical equipment to stun an animal but not to electro-immobilise it. You must: make sure there’s a good electrical contact with the animal the electrodes must span the brain of the animal and be adapted for the size of the animal Read the Humane Slaughter Association’s guidance on electrical stunning of animals . You must use the following minimum currents: for cattle 6 months old or older - 1.28 amps for cattle younger than 6 months - 1.25 amps for sheep and goats - 1.0 amps for pigs - 1.3 amps chicken - 240 milliamps turkeys - 400 milliamps After you’ve stunned an animal using electricity you must kill it immediately. Bleeding cattle, sheep, goats, pigs and deer After you’ve stunned cattle, sheep, goats, pigs or deer, you can kill them by bleeding or pithing. You must cut the 2 carotid arteries in an animal’s neck to bleed it. You need to: begin the bleeding immediately after you’ve stunned the animal to ensure it dies quickly make sure the animal doesn’t regain consciousness before it dies You must wait the following amounts of time for the bleeding to stop before you dress or scald it: 30 seconds for cattle 20 seconds for sheep, deer, pigs and goats"
/guidance/red-meat-slaughterhouses-restraining-stunning-killing-animals,"Stunning pens, restraining boxes, captive bolt, gas and electrical stunning equipment, bleeding animals and restraining methods. Red meat slaughterhouses: restraining, stunning, killing animals  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs If you operate a red meat slaughterhouse (abattoir) you must ensure that anyone working in it has a certificate of competence ( CoC ) if they do any of the following: handle animals stun animals pith animals restrain animals shackle animals hoist animals bleed live animals check stunning has worked check pithing has worked You risk being prosecuted and losing your CoC if you don’t follow these and other Welfare of Animals at the Time of Killing (WATOK) requirements . If you’re responsible for stunning, hoisting and bleeding animals, you must carry out all operations on one animal before moving to the next. Restraining animals You must restrain an animal before you stun or kill it. Your equipment for restraining animals must: be in good working order allow you to stun or kill an animal effectively prevent injury or cuts to animals minimise struggling and vocalisation minimise the time an animal’s restrained You must only put animals into restraining equipment, including head restraints, when you’re ready to stun or kill the animal. Stunning pens for cattle You must use a stunning pen or restraining pen for adult cattle, including bovine animals such as buffalo and bison. You must only use restraining equipment in the way described in the manufacturer’s instructions. Stunning pens and restraining boxes must: be in good working order only accommodate one animal at a time prevent any large movements forwards, backwards or sideways allow complete access to an animal’s forehead Stunning cattle with a pneumatic captive bolt If you use pneumatic captive bolts you must have a restraining device in any new stunning pens and restraining boxes you’ve bough since 1 January 2013. Your restraining device must: restrict an animal’s head from moving both up and down, and side to side allow the release of an animal’s head immediately after stunning All stunning pens and restraining boxes used with a pneumatic captive bolt must have this device by 8 December 2019. Religious slaughter If you carry out religious slaughter on cattle, sheep or goats, you must follow the additional rules regarding restraining an animal . You must use restraining equipment. The Food Standards Agency ( FSA ) must approve cattle restraining pens before they’re used for religious slaughter. Killing horses You must kill a horse in a separate room or a bay from other animals. The room must only be used for this purpose. You can’t kill a horse: in sight of another horse in a room where there are remains of another horse or other animal Restraining methods you must not use You must not use the following methods as a way of restraining animals: suspending or hoisting conscious animals clamping or tying an animal’s legs or feet severing an animal’s spinal cord immobilising an animal with electrical stunning equipment or electric shock devices Animal stunning and killing You must stun all animals before you kill them, unless you’re carrying out religious slaughter . When you stun an animal, it must remain unconscious and unable to feel pain until death. Once you stun it, you must kill it immediately. You can use stunning methods that instantly kill an animal, for example using a gun or rifle. Simple stunning Simple stunning is where you stun an animal unconscious but don’t instantly kill it. You must immediately use a follow-up procedure to kill the animal before it recovers consciousness, eg bleeding (cutting both neck arteries, the carotid arteries). Monitoring animals for consciousness Between stunning and killing, you must check animals for signs of consciousness and unconsciousness. You must have a CoC on checking the effectiveness of stunning. Your slaughterhouse’s standard operating procedure should also list what monitoring procedures will be used for each type of animal. Someone, usually an animal welfare officer ( AWO ), should monitor each slaughter line to check animals are being stunned effectively. Review your sampling rate You must check that stunning is effective. How often you do this depends on risk factors such as: how often you change the species or size and weight of animals on a slaughter line the length of each slaughterman shift the results of previous sampling - you’ll need to increase the sampling rate if a previous check found a percentage of animals were not effectively stunned If you find an animal that hasn’t been properly stunned, you must take immediate action in line with your slaughterhouse’s standard operating procedure . If you fail to stun an animal properly, you must first re-stun the animal and then find out what’s wrong and correct your operation immediately. What to record You must check a representative sample of the animals you’re stunning. For each sample, you must record: the number of animals checked the name of the person monitoring the time and circumstances, eg immediately after stunning an animal any factors affecting the efficiency of the stunning process whether your findings are consistent with previous monitoring tests of unconsciousness and how to interpret the results religious slaughter - tests for signs of life and how to interpret the results Stunning or killing: equipment and methods Any equipment you use for stunning or killing must: stun or kill rapidly and effectively be in good working order have the manufacturer’s instructions on how to operate it You must have back-up stunning equipment available immediately on the spot, in case your main equipment fails. Maintain your equipment You must maintain equipment following the manufacturer’s instructions. You must keep maintenance records for at least a year. The FSA can ask to see them. Electrical stunning Electrical stunning is a method of simple stunning, so you’ll need to follow it with another operation to kill the animal once it’s unconscious. When you carry out electrical stunning you must make sure that: there’s good electrical contact with the animal electrodes span the brain of the animal and can be adapted for the size of animal the current is strong enough to make an animal unconscious until death In addition you must: kill the animal before it recovers consciousness use at least the minimum currents for each species Minimum currents for head-only electrical stunning Species Minimum current Cattle 6 months or older 1.28 amps (A) Cattle younger than 6 months 1.25A Sheep and goats 1.0A Pigs 1.3A Head-to-body electrical stunning If you’re using electrodes on an animal’s head and body, you must use the following currents: sheep and goats - 1A pigs - 1.3A You can’t use this method of simple stunning on cattle. Monitor electrical stunning For each animal you stun, equipment must be fitted with a device that displays key parameters such as: voltage current length of exposure The device must be clearly visible to staff carrying out stunning. Your standard operating procedure should state what parameters you need to record. If the electrodes don’t deliver the right current or voltage for the right amount of time, the device must give a warning that you can clearly see and hear. You must keep all records for at least a year. Equipment purchased after 1 January 2013 - and all equipment from 8 December 2019 - must be fitted with a device that can record the parameters used for each animal stunned. These records must be kept for all equipment. Captive bolt stunning You must follow manufacturer’s instructions when using any device, including positioning and using the correct strength of cartridge. Penetrative captive bolt You can use penetrative captive bolt devices for simple stunning for all species. You must apply the device in the proper position. You must check the bolt has retracted to its full extent after each shot. If the bolt hasn’t fully retracted, you must not use the device until it’s repaired You must not shoot cattle (or any bovine animal, including bison and buffalo) in the back of the head. Penetrative captive bolt: sheep and goats with horns When stunning sheep and goats that have horns: you can shoot the animal in the back of the head - you must aim the shot just behind the base of the horns and aim towards the mouth. you must bleed or kill an animal within 15 seconds of shooting it. Non-penetrative captive bolt You can only use non-penetrative captive bolt devices for simple stunning on cattle, sheep, goats and deer (ruminants) under 10 kg. You must apply the device in the proper position. Firearm stunning You can use a firearm or shotgun to stun and kill an animal. You must use the correct power and calibre of cartridge for the type of animal. Gas stunning Gas stunning is a method of killing pigs. You must use a gas stunner to do this and follow the manufacturer’s instructions. You must expose each pig to the gas for long enough to kill it and be able to: visually monitor pigs in the gas stunner access the pigs as quickly as possible flush the stunner with air so you can enter the chamber Gas stunners and their conveyors must: minimise struggling or vocalisation allow pigs to remain standing until they lose consciousness get pigs to the point of maximum gas concentration within 30 seconds have enough space for pigs to lie down without lying on each other, even when you’re operating at maximum capacity have adequate lighting to allow pigs to see other pigs and their surroundings. Gas stunners and their conveyors must not injure or bruise pigs, or compress a pig’s chest. Gas monitoring devices Gas stunners must have a monitoring device that continuously measures and displays the gas concentration. You must make sure the device is clearly visible to staff. Gas stunners installed since January 2013 must record the gas concentration. By December 2019, all gas stunners must record the gas concentration. If the gas concentration falls below the correct level, the monitoring device must display a clear visible warning and sound an alarm. You can’t allow a pig to go into or remain in the stunner if: there’s a problem with the gas stunner the alarm goes off the gas concentration falls below the correct level Keep records for gas stunners installed since January 2013 When using gas stunners installed since January 2013, you must record: the gas concentration the length of exposure to gas You should keep the records for at least a year. From 8 December 2019, this information must be recorded by all gas stunners. Gas mixtures You can use: carbon dioxide at high concentration carbon dioxide mixed with inert gases inert gases You must not allow gases to enter into the chamber or the location where animals are to be stunned and killed in a way that it could create burns or excitement by freezing or lack of humidity. You must only stun pigs by gas if each pig is exposed to the gas for long enough to make sure it’s killed. Carbon dioxide at high concentration The minimum concentration is 80% carbon dioxide. Exposure of conscious pigs to the gas must lead to anoxia (loss of oxygen to the brain). You must make sure that no pig enters the gas stunner if the carbon dioxide concentration by volume falls below 80%. A pig must be conveyed to the maximum concentration of gas within 30 seconds of entering the stunner. Carbon dioxide mixed with inert gases Expose conscious pigs directly or progressively to a gas mixture containing up to 40% of carbon dioxide mixed with inert gases. The maximum concentration is 40% carbon dioxide. Direct or progressive exposure of conscious pigs to the gas must lead to anoxia. Inert gases Expose conscious pigs directly or progressively to an inert gas mixture such as argon or nitrogen. This exposure must lead to anoxia. Bleeding animals Bleeding is a killing method for cattle, sheep, goats, pigs and deer following simple stunning. You must cut an animal’s 2 carotid arteries. Bleeding must: begin immediately after simple stunning be rapid be profuse be completed before the animal regains consciousness If you bleed an animal after simple stunning, you must wait for the bleeding to stop and at least: 30 seconds for cattle 20 seconds for sheep, deer, pigs and goats You have to confirm there are no signs of life before you can dress the animal. Shackling or hoisting animals Animals must be unconscious before they are shackled or hoisted. You must have a CoC to perform this operation."

Dangerous dogs: tougher penalties for irresponsible dog owners  Home Office Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Read up-to-date information on dangerous dogs (This press release was published on 6 August 2013 and has not been updated since) Irresponsible dog owners who allow their dogs to attack members of the public could face longer jail terms. 16 people have been fatally attacked since 2005 but the owners of dangerously out of control dogs can only be sent to jail for a maximum of two years. As part of the government’s plans to clampdown on dangerous dogs, the public are now being given the chance to have their say about whether dog owners should be given harsher sentences when their dogs attack and cause serious or fatal injuries. Animal welfare minister Lord de Mauley said: Dog attacks are terrifying and we need harsh penalties to punish those who allow their dog to injure people while out of control. We’re already toughening up laws to ensure that anyone who owns a dangerous dog can be brought to justice, regardless of where a dog attack takes place. It’s crucial that the laws we have in place act as a deterrent to stop such horrific incidents.” In February the government announced that it would introduce new measures to tackle out of control dogs by changing the law to ensure that irresponsible owners can be prosecuted regardless of where their dog attacks.

/government/news/dangerous-dogs-law-changes-cover-attacks-on-private-property,"Legal powers for the police to tackle irresponsible dog owners and improve public safety are among legislative changes being published today. Dangerous dogs law changes cover attacks on private property  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Read up-to-date information on dangerous dogs . (This press release was updated on 9 May 2013 and has not been updated since) Legal powers for the police to tackle irresponsible dog owners and improve public safety are among legislative changes being published in the draft Dangerous Dogs (Amendment) Bill today. The Government announced in February that it will extend the dangerous dogs legislation to make it an offence for a dog to be dangerously out of control in any place, including all private property. Under Government plans, dog owners will no longer be immune from prosecution if their dog attacks a person in the home. This change in the law will give protection to the healthcare, postal and utility professionals who visit private properties for work. The legislative changes being introduced today will extend the law to include all private property. It will mean that owners can be prosecuted if they fail to stop their dogs attacking someone on their own or someone else’s private property. If convicted, they could face an unlimited fine and/or up to two years in jail. However there will be no protection for trespassers such as burglars who are attacked by a householder’s dog. Animal Welfare Minister Lord de Mauley said: “Out of control dogs are just as much a threat on private property as in public places. We are extending the law so that owners who allow their dogs to be dangerously out of control anywhere can be brought to justice.” Attacks on guide dogs and other assistance dogs will also be explicitly covered by dangerous dogs legislation for the first time, Lord De Mauley confirmed today. Under the plans, the owner, or person in charge, of a dog that attacks an assistance dog can be prosecuted. Lord de Mauley said: “The law must recognise the devastating effect that an attack on an assistance dog can have on its owner. In the past, assistance dogs have been harmed so badly by other dogs that their owners have been robbed of their independence and quality of life.” Legislative changes will make clear the court’s right to take into account the character of the owner as they take action to tackle irresponsible ownership. When a banned breed is identified, its owners can apply to have it exempted from destruction. In assessing this application, the court will consider the character of the person in charge of the banned breed, as well the temperament and past behaviour of the dog. The Government is bringing in compulsory microchipping for all dogs from 6 April 2016 to help reunite owners with lost or stolen pets, relieve the burden on animal charities and local authorities and promote responsible dog ownership by improving the traceability of dog and owner. The changes to attacks on private property and to attacks on assistance dogs apply to England and Wales. The banned breed amendment will apply to the whole of Great Britain.

/government/news/action-to-clamp-down-on-dangerous-dogs,"Consultation launched on longer jail terms for owners of dogs that attack people or assistance dogs, such as guide dogs. Action to clamp down on dangerous dogs  Home Office Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Read up-to-date information on dangerous dogs . (This news story was updated on 6 August 2013 and has not been updated since) Irresponsible owners whose dogs attack people or assistance dogs could face longer jail terms as part of a consultation launched today (6 August). Sixteen people have been fatally attacked since 2005, but the owners of dangerously out of control dogs can only be sent to jail for a maximum of two years. Longer sentences The public are now being given the chance to have their say about whether there should be a longer maximum sentence available when an individual’s dog attacks a person or assistance dog and causes serious or fatal injuries. In February the government announced it would introduce new measures to tackle out of control dogs by changing the law to ensure irresponsible owners can be prosecuted regardless of where their dog attacks. Under the government’s plans, prosecutions could also be brought against owners of dogs that attack guide dogs and other assistance dogs. Crime Prevention Minister Jeremy Browne said: Dog owners who fail to take responsibility for their dogs must be held accountable. Today’s consultation will give the public a say in whether owners of dangerous dogs that attack people should face tougher penalties, possibly life imprisonment. Jeremy Browne is meeting victims and campaigners during a visit today to the offices of charity The Guide Dogs for the Blind Association. He added: This government is taking urgent action to protect the public from out of control dogs. We are changing the law so owners can be prosecuted for attacks on private property and our anti-social behaviour reforms will give the police and local agencies more effective powers to deal with dangerous dogs.

Owners of dogs who kill could face 14 years imprisonment  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Read up-to-date information on dangerous dogs . (This press release was published on 29 October 2013 and has not been updated since) The government is proposing to increase the maximum penalties for owners whose dogs are dangerously out of control following a consultation this summer. Current penalties stand at two years’ imprisonment and/or an unlimited fine for aggravated offences but the changes announced today will see the penalties increased to; 14 years’ imprisonment if a person dies as a result of a dog attack, 5 years’ imprisonment if a person is injured by a dog attack, and 3 years’ imprisonment if an assistance dog either dies or is injured by a dog attack In coming to a decision on new maximum penalties for dog attacks, we have taken into account the responses to the consultation and the need for maximum penalties to be proportionate to the offence. We have also compared the current maximum penalty with the maximum penalties for other offences. Animal Welfare Minister Lord de Mauley said: “It is right that the punishments of those who allow their dog to kill or injure people or assistance dogs are proportionate to the horrendous impact dog attacks can have. “We’re toughening up laws to ensure that anyone who owns a dangerous dog can be brought to justice, regardless of where an attack takes place. We’re also giving local authorities and the police new powers to nip issues in the bud and take action before a dog attack takes place.” The increase in maximum penalty for a dog attack on an assistance dog, such as a guide dog for the blind, reflects the devastating effect such an attack has on the assisted person. As now, each of these offences could also be punishable by an unlimited fine instead of or in addition to imprisonment. An amendment to the Dangerous Dogs Act to effect these changes will be tabled for consideration during Lords Committee Stage of the Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Bill.

/guidance/enforcement-officers-issuing-fixed-penalty-notices,"How and when you can issue fixed penalty notices (FPNs), if you've been authorised by a district or parish council, or another authority.  Enforcement officers: issuing fixed penalty notices  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Overview Before you can issue fixed penalty notices (FPNs) you must be authorised to do so. Different authorities have different powers to issue FPNs . You should be familiar with your authority’s: powers strategy for issuing and enforcing FPNs penalty levels areas where FPNs are used Police community support officers (PCSOs) PCSOs are authorised to issue FPNs for littering and dog control offences. Some police forces also authorise their PCSOs to issue FPNs for fly-posting and graffiti. Your equipment You should be provided with a uniform and a PACE notebook (designed to record evidence in compliance with the Police & Criminal Evidence Act 1984 ). You must carry evidence that you’re an authorised enforcement officer. When to issue fixed penalty notices Only issue an FPN when all of the following apply: an offence has been committed an FPN is a proportionate response there’s evidence to support prosecution if the offender doesn’t pay the fixed penalty the offender understands why the FPN is being issued you believe that the name and address offered by the offender are correct When not to issue a fixed penalty notice Don’t issue an FPN if any of the following apply: there’s no criminal liability enforcement action is inappropriate or would be disproportionate for the offence prosecution is more suitable littering is done accidentally No criminal liability Don’t issue an FPN in the following cases: the person in question is exempt, eg a blind person whose dog has fouled in an area where a dog control order applies the offender is a child under the age of 10 (inform the child’s parents instead) Enforcement action is inappropriate or disproportionate Don’t issue an FPN in the following cases: it’s not in the public interest to do so the offender is vulnerable the offence is trivial Prosecution is more suitable Don’t issue an FPN in the following cases: the offence is major, eg deliberate smashing of glass or racist graffiti the offence is committed by a persistent offender the offender is violent or aggressive Accidental littering Don’t issue FPNs for accidental littering, for example if something falls from someone’s pocket. Only issue FPNs where there is evidence of intent to drop litter. Give offenders the chance to pick up litter before you issue an FPN . Warn them that you will issue an FPN if they don’t. How to issue an FPN You should issue FPNs on the spot, if possible. You can also issue them by post if necessary. Getting the offender’s details Ask the offender for their details. Call the police for assistance in the following cases: the offender refuses to give you their details you suspect the offender has given you false details A police community support officer ( PCSO ) can detain the offender for up to 30 minutes before a police constable arrives. The offender can be fined an additional amount on top of the FPN , if they refuse to give you details, or provide false details. Using the DVLA’s database You can use the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) vehicle keeper database to find out the owners of vehicles used in connection with the following offences: littering dog fouling fly-posting Gathering evidence Record evidence in your PACE notebook. Include a description of all of the following: the offence the date and time the name and address of the offender the age of the offender the offender’s appearance the weather and light conditions at the time Issuing FPNs on private land You must have permission from the landowner or occupier before you enter private land to issue FPNs. This applies to privately owned land which the public can access. The only exception is for waste collection authorities investigating fly-tipping. They can enter private land without permission. Children You can’t issue FPNs to children under 10, as they are below the age of criminal responsibility. You can contact their parents to make them aware of the offence. Juveniles Juveniles are aged 10 to 17. You should check your authority’s enforcement strategy for dealing with juveniles before issuing FPNs to them. When issuing FPNs to juveniles, you should: always be in uniform never touch a young person approach from the front, not behind identify yourselves and offer formal identification ideally work in pairs Juveniles aged 16 to 17 You must get all of the following from the offender: name address age date of birth Also get the name and address of a parent or legal guardian of the offender. You must tell the young offender that this information will be shared with their local youth offending team. If you need to interview a young person under 17 under caution you must do so with an appropriate adult present. If you have any doubts as to whether the offender is 16 or over, follow the procedures for dealing with 10 to 15 year olds. Juveniles aged 10 to 15 You can issue an FPN to 10 to 15 year olds on the spot in the following cases: if you know the offender if the offender’s school has agreed to the use of FPNs You must tell the offender’s parents, guardian or school as soon as possible. If you don’t know the offender or their school hasn’t agreed to the use of an FPN , get the young person’s details, and details of their parents or legal guardian to make further enquiries. If it’s decided that an FPN is suitable, issue it to the offender in person with a parent or legal guardian present. If you have to issue the FPN in writing, notify the offender’s parent or legal guardian at the same time."

Parish councils: change or revoke a dog control order  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs If you’re a parish council, you can change or revoke existing dog control orders ( DCOs ). You can no longer make new DCOs , or add a new offence to an existing DCO . From October 2017, existing DCOs will become public space protection orders ( PSPOs ). What you can change in DCOs You can change any of the following: the number of dogs any one person can walk at a time the area that a DCO covers when the rules of the DCO must be obeyed whether dogs need to be on leads and how long the leads must be You can’t change a DCO to create a new offence. For example, you can’t extend a DCO to control dog fouling if it was originally set up to cover leash requirements. How to change or revoke a dog control order Allow at least 56 days to change or revoke a DCO . You must: Consult your district council. If the DCO applies to open access land , consult the local access authority and the local access forum. Publish a notice of your proposed changes in a local newspaper, including all of the following: the area affected - and if it will apply to access land you must say so the changes you’re making where people can see a map of the area (if the order refers to a map) when the DCO applies a postal and email address for comments (you must allow at least 28 days for comments) Publish a further notice in the same local paper if you make changes due to comments received.

/guidance/landscape-and-seascape-character-assessments,"How to carry out and use landscape and seascape character assessments. Landscape and seascape character assessments Landscape Natural England Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Landscape character assessments (LCAs) Landscape character assessment ( LCA ) is the process of identifying and describing variation in character of the landscape. LCA documents identify and explain the unique combination of elements and features that make landscapes distinctive by mapping and describing character types and areas. They also show how the landscape is perceived, experienced and valued by people. Who should prepare LCAs LCAs can be done at any scale and prepared by: local councils planning departments community groups consultants developers private practices land owners What LCAs are used for You can prepare an LCA to inform a wide range of activities, such as: planning policies and decisions sensitivity and capacity studies land management plans landscape and visual impact assessments local council studies minerals planning place making green infrastructure agri-environment schemes forest and woodland strategies waterways strategies renewable energy national park management plans LCAs are also useful for monitoring change across the landscape. How to carry out an LCA Define the purpose and scope of your LCA , eg the area it will cover, its scale, level of detail and resources available to carry out the work. Conduct a desk study – collect, review and analyse data and documentation and speak to stakeholders involved with the landscape. Conduct a field survey – test, refine and add to the outputs from the desk study, capturing aesthetic, perceptual and experiential qualities of the landscape. Classify, map and describe the landscape’s character areas, types and characteristics including geological, other physical and socio-cultural influences. What to include Capture the characteristics of the landscape including: topographic features flora and fauna land use sights, sounds, touch and smells cultural associations, history and memories The completed LCA will be a document detailing the character of the landscape and an annotated map showing the character areas or types. You can also include photos, diagrams and survey results. Using old LCAs There may be an existing LCA for your area of interest. You can use, or update, an existing LCA but bear in mind its original purpose, age, scale and how much has changed since it was written. For example, a 10-year-old LCA for a small housing development would not be appropriate to inform a local council’s tourism strategy. Older LCAs can remain useful for monitoring change in the landscape. Record keeping Keep all the work that informed your LCA for future reference and make sure it’s easily accessible. Seascape character assessments For coastal and marine landscapes, you can conduct a seascape character assessment ( SCA ). There is often crossover so you can combine landscape and seascape character assessments if it’s appropriate for your area of interest. Generally, you should carry out an SCA for areas seaward of the low water mark and an LCA for areas landward of the high water mark. You can use one or the other, or a combination for intertidal land. What to include As well as capturing the physical and perceptual characteristics required for an LCA , you should also record: atmospheric conditions, eg climate human use of the coast and sea coastal features surface water features coastal processes sunken and buried characteristics Find out more Read more about character assessments in these Natural England publications including further detail, examples and advice. landscape character assessment seascape character assessment"

England Coast Path: comment on new proposals Access and rights of way Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Natural England Overview The England Coast Path (ECP) is a new national trail being created by Natural England. For the first time people will have the right of access around all our open coast both along the England Coast Path, and usually, over the associated ‘coastal margin’. Consultation with landowners and occupiers If you are a landowner or occupier you will be contacted by Natural England to discuss their ideas for the new stretch of the path. This will happen before a proposal is published. At this point you can discuss: initial ideas for the route new signs and gates that may be needed. Comment on a proposed new stretch of path Natural England will submit a report to government with proposals for improved access to stretches of the English coast. You can see proposed new routes on the England Coast Path: improving public access to the coast web page. Anyone can comment on proposals, this is known as ‘making a representation’. You need to submit your comments within 8 weeks of Natural England publishing its proposals on its homepage using the form supplied with the proposals. Details of your comments are sent to the Secretary of State to be considered before making a decision about the report. You can withdraw your comments by writing to Natural England at any time. Object to a proposed new stretch of path As a landowner or occupier you can make an objection to the report. Natural England will tell you that they have published a report with new proposals and how you can make an objection. Your objection must reach Natural England within 8 weeks of the proposal being published online. The closing date will be on the form. You can withdraw an objection by writing to Natural England at any time. Your objection will be sent to the Planning Inspectorate. An inspector will review your objection before making recommendations to the Secretary of State. Your written objection is usually enough for the inspector to reach a conclusion, but occasionally a hearing or inquiry is necessary. The inspector may decide to visit your land as part of their review. They must invite you to be there when they visit. Comment on an objection If the inspector thinks that the proposals may not strike a fair balance between your rights as a landowner or occupier and the rights of the public to access coastal land, they will publish a notice on the Planning Inspectorate website with details of any objections and Natural England’s comments on them. Anyone can then comment on this notice by making a representation. Representations need to be received within 8 weeks of the notice being published online. The closing date will be on the form. Read the final decision Once the inspector has reviewed the case, they will set out their conclusion and make recommendations to the Secretary of State. If they believe a fair balance has been struck then they will recommend that Natural England’s proposals are approved. If they believe a fair balance has not been struck then they will normally recommend a modification of the proposals to remedy this. After considering this advice and all the other evidence, the Secretary of State will then publish details of their decision ."

The Big Tree Plant was launched in December 2010 and brings together a number of organisations with the aim of planting one million trees in urban and residential areas over the next four years. Speaking after she planted the tree, Mrs Spelman said: “Hitting the 100,000 mark is a fantastic achievement and shows how much people care about enhancing our urban green spaces. “The number of trees in urban and semi-urban areas has dropped over recent years, so the point of this campaign is to reverse that trend so that we can all gain from the benefits that trees provide in our towns and cities.” The Big Tree Plant campaign brings together civil society partners and conservation organisations, such as The Tree Council, Woodland Trust, Trees for Cities, England’s Community Forests, Keep Britain Tidy and others, working with Defra and the Forestry Commission. The campaign is supported by grant funding of £1 million per year for the next four years and will get more people in local communities planting and caring for trees. Phil Barton chief executive Keep Britain Tidy said: “We are thrilled to be involved with the Big Tree Plant. We are delighted to be able to involve hundreds of schools and communities and thousands of young people from across England working closely with our partners, BTCV and ourselves to create green and sustainable communities.” BTCV Chief Executive Tom Flood CBE said: “BTCV believes in positive, practical action to tackle climate change. Trees are vital to our survival and the survival of our planet - they oxygenate the air we breathe and take carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. We have a duty to protect them and encourage their growth and BTCV is delighted to be involved in this exciting campaign and with our achievements at planting and distributing over 100,000 trees to date.” Further information on how to get involved in the campaign is available at http://www.forestry.gov.uk/england-bigtreeplant Notes The Big Tree Plant is a campaign to encourage people and communities to plant more trees in England’s towns, cities and neighbourhoods.

The campaign brings together civil society partners and conservation organisations, such as The Tree Council, Woodland Trust, Trees for Cities and England’s Community Forests, working with Defra and the Forestry Commission. The campaign is supported by grant funding of £1 million per year for the next four years and will get more people in local communities planting and caring for trees. Launching The Big Tree Plant, Defra Minister Jim Paice said: “The Big Tree Plant will use the power of the Big Society to plant trees in areas where people want and need them. Using the enthusiasm of local communities and the knowledge of the groups that know most about trees and their unique benefits, we’ll help create neighbourhoods that we can be proud of.” Supporting the Big Tree Plant campaign, Griff Rhys-Jones, president of Civic Voice, said: “As President of Civic Voice, I welcome The Big Tree Plant. Civic Voice works to make our cities, towns and villages more attractive, enjoyable and distinctive - all of which can be achieved through The Big Tree Plant. We all have a personal responsibility for where we live, and The Big Tree Plant is a great way for people to get together with their neighbours, civic society and local community groups to plant and care for more trees and improve the local environment for everyone.  Plant a tree, change the future and the future will thank you for it.” In recent years the rate of trees being planted annually in urban and semi-urban areas across the country has declined. The Big Tree Plant will increase the number of trees being planted in these areas by supporting community groups and organisations to establish or expand projects to plant and care for trees. Groups that are interested in planting trees may apply for grant funding from today. Projects will be encouraged in areas of greatest need. Defra has already funded significant new projects this tree planting season including: The NHS Forest - 65,000 trees across 25 sites The Tree Council - 1,000+ trees across four sites Keep Britain Tidy - 100,000 trees across 750 sites. The campaign is included as a priority in Defra’s Structural Reform Plan and Business Plan.

They will green the NHS Estates and plant one tree per employee amounting to 1.3 million trees within the next 5 years. This will encourage greater social cohesion between NHS sites and the local community and will bring together a range of professionals and volunteers. The Tree Council - will work with the local council and volunteer tree wardens in the Walsall area of Birmingham to plant a community orchard with the local community as the first phase of a longer term initiative for planting fruit trees in Walsall.  The community orchard will be open to volunteers and the public alike, providing a valuable green space close to the town centre which will encourage local people to come together and get involved. Keep Britain Tidy - will work with BTCV to deliver this tree planting, building on their existing programmes in England including Eco-schools, The Big Tidy Up and Green Flag Park sites.  The trees will be planted in areas that are accessible to local communities and will be planted by children, volunteers and community groups.  More information on Defra’s forestry work programme can be found on the Defra website: https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/sustaining-and-enhancing-trees-forests-and-woodland"

The Big Tree Plant, launched by Defra and the Forestry Commission in 2010, is supported by a number of partner organisations and will see a million new trees planted predominantly in towns, cities and neighbourhoods by 2015. On a visit to the Mount Stewart Junior School in Kenton, David Heath MP, Minister for Forestry met with Year 4 students planting fruit trees with Trees for Cities. David Heath said: “The Big Tree Plant is an opportunity for everyone to help make neighbourhoods attractive and healthy places to live.  It’s wonderful to see young people learning to plant and care for trees. “The Big Tree Plant has been embraced by communities across the country and has proved to be a highly successful partnership between Government, civil society partners and conservation organisations including Trees for Cities. “Seventy percent of trees in The Big Tree Plant programme will be planted in England’s most deprived areas.” The planting at Mount Stewart Junior School is part of the London-wide Trees for Cities project which received £240,000 funding from the Big Tree Plant. The project aims to plant 40,000 trees across London over four years. These trees will enhance the quality of life for local people providing places to grow food and escape the stresses of city life. Sharon Johnson, Trees for Cities Chief Executive Officer said: “The Big Tree Plant has given us a wonderful opportunity to plant fruit trees in schools and other urban spaces as part of our Trees for Food programme. One of the most important things schools can do is to teach children to grow their own food, helping children to understand where food comes from and how to produce it. “Our Trees for Food programme has wider implications on the surrounding community who are encouraged to get involved and receive training so that they then have the skills to plant their own trees on estates and other derelict and deprived urban locations.” While making towns and cities more attractive places to live and work, Big Tree Plant trees are also creating new copses, supporting wildlife conservation, flood reduction through riverbank planting and helping to cool cities by reducing temperatures. More than one in ten trees being planted are creating new orchards to grow fruit so community groups can grow their own food and make jams, pickles and chutneys. Due to the popularity of campaign, March 2013 is likely to be the final opportunity for communities to apply for the remaining share of funding from the Forestry Commission. Mark Durk, Head of the Big Tree Plant for the Forestry Commission said: “With only £600,000 of funding still to be allocated, now is the time to start planning your Big Tree Plant project with the next round of funding applications closing on the 15 March 2013. “The level of motivation from partners and volunteers to make the programme a success has been astounding.” Notes Details of the Big Tree Plant can be found at: www.forestry.gov.uk/england-bigtreeplant The campaign has the support of major bodies, environmental charities and agencies including Department for Communities and Local Government, England’s Community Forests, Forestry Commission, The Greater London Authority, Groundwork, Royal Botanic Gardens Kew, The Local Government Association (LGA), Mayor of London, The National Forest, Natural England, Tree Council, Trees for Cities, The Conservation Volunteers and Woodland Trust.

/government/news/big-tree-plants-millionth-tree-planted,"Environment Secretary Elizabeth Truss plants an oak to celebrate the leafier streets and cities. Big Tree Plant's millionth tree planted  Forestry Commission Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs We all want the place we live to be as beautiful as it can be and the government’s tree-planting campaign to make that happen in England’s towns and cities has hit the million mark. Today Elizabeth Truss, the environment secretary, is planting an oak to celebrate the Big Tree Plant reaching its ambitious target, which it is now set to surpass. The campaign has been led by Defra, and the Forestry Commission has provided £4 million to pay for planting and caring for the trees. This has gone in grants to the volunteers and groups who have brought communities together to make the Big Tree Plant such a success. Trees help ensure a healthy urban environment and make our towns and cities even more enjoyable places to live. As they grow, these trees will bring greenery, blossom, wildlife and shade to previously bare streetscapes, revive neglected waste ground with urban woods and orchards, and liven up verges and school grounds. Everyone should have the chance to live in a leafy street, not just the better-off. That is why half the trees in the Big Tree Plant are going into the 33% most deprived neighbourhoods or those with the least green space. As part of its commitment to a healthy natural environment, this government is championing the planting of trees in the countryside as well as towns and cities. Since 2010, we have funded the planting of at least 10 million rural trees, reinvigorating existing woodlands and planting new forests and copses. This country now has more tree cover than at any time for the past 700 years. The Secretary of State planted the tree in Eastville Park with Forestry Commission Chair Sir Harry Studholme, Bristol Mayor George Ferguson and Director General of the Tree Council Pauline Buchanan Black. They were joined by children from Glenfrome Primary School who are planting their own trees as part of the project. Environment Secretary Elizabeth Truss said: “Nothing is more symbolic of England’s trees than the mighty oak. So it’s fitting that I am planting a young oak today to mark the success of our campaign to plant a million trees in English towns and cities. “Trees are an essential part of the healthy environment that is so important for quality of life and wellbeing. That’s especially true in areas which don’t have much greenery, which is why we have made sure that all of the trees planted have been in urban areas of the country or in places with the least trees and green space.” Forestry Commission Chair Sir Harry Studholme said: “The success of the Big Tree Plant demonstrates people’s enthusiasm for trees. The opportunity to plant trees to benefit the neighbourhoods of the wide range of groups involved has not only brought trees into cities, but has also brought communities together. “I feel sure that the legacy of the project is not just in the trees planted and their impact on the environment, but in the experiences of the people involved and how they take that experience and support for trees into the future.” The Big Tree Plant has made funding available to any community and voluntary group, or other non-profit organisation that is keen to establish and look after community-led tree planting projects. Launched in 2010 by the government, the campaign has been delivered through the Forestry Commission and Defra, with advice and support from a number of partners including the Tree Council, Trees for Cities and the Community Forests. Director General of the Tree Council Pauline Buchanan Black said: “The planting of the millionth tree is a landmark not just for the Big Tree Plant, but for the communities that have come together and responded to the campaign with enthusiasm and vigour. They are the people who we must thank for making it such a success. “Their work in planning the projects, planting and caring for the trees has changed neighbourhood landscapes and generated a sense of responsibility and ownership for the local environment. What’s more, every time they pass, these champions of our trees will have the satisfaction of seeing new growth and beauty. It couldn’t have happened without them.” The programme has attracted a wide variety of organisations including wildlife trusts, community farms, volunteer groups and urban regeneration projects. Nearly 400 applications were made and over 160 groups, ranging from large charities to small community groups, won funding. Participating groups have pledged almost £7 million in match funding.

Apply for an accommodation licence on the River Thames  Environment Agency Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs You must have a licence if you have an existing structure or want to build a new structure on the River Thames that’s: in, on or over the river cut into the bank on a towpath owned by the Environment Agency Structures are known as ‘accommodations’ and include: jetties pontoons docks boathouses slipways landing stages footbridges offshore mooring piles and buoys rubbing posts miscellaneous piles You must get a licence whether your structure is for private, shared or commercial use. You’ll only be given permission for public or private amenity work schemes of a non-navigational nature (eg building development) in exceptional circumstances. Getting a licence You must apply to the Environment Agency for your licence and pay an annual fee. Licences begin on 29 September each year and are granted on a pro rata basis depending on when you apply. For example, if you apply for your licence on 29 August you’ll just pay the fee for the period between then and 28 September of that year. You’ll then have to pay the next year’s fee in full. You can’t transfer a licence to someone else. You must get a licence yourself if you buy or move into a property with a structure. You’ll be sent a licence plate when your licence is granted. You must display this on the structure. Existing structures without a licence You must tell the Environment Agency if you already have a structure that hasn’t been licensed before and you want to keep it. Your structure may be removed and you could be charged for it’s removal if you don’t get a licence. Download and fill in the retain accommodation form and send it to the address on the form. New owners of existing structures You must tell the Environment Agency if you’re the new owner of an existing structure that needs a licence. Download and fill in the change of circumstances form and send it to the address on the form. Building new structures and changing existing structures To build a new structure or change an existing structure you must do both of the following: apply for flood defence consent submit the plans of your proposed structure or changes to the Environment Agency You’ll be sent an information pack telling you what to do next when you apply for consent. Licensing requirements To get a licence your structure should only: be used for landing and mooring purposes and to give access to the river encroach into the river as much as is reasonably necessary for it to fulfil its purpose The Environment Agency may make an exception about how much your structure can encroach into the river if they decide that it has enough fishery and environmental benefits and that it doesn’t unacceptably impact the normal river flow and the floodplain. Each application is assessed on an individual basis, with the local environment and individual requirements taken into account. Your application may be refused, or you may have to make compensatory measures or provide mitigation if the Environment Agency decides that your proposed structure will have a negative impact on the local ecology or flood defences. You’ll be sent a full list of the requirements with your application pack. Landing stages Landing stages should be decked structures that allow the water to pass underneath. They usually shouldn’t be made of concrete or otherwise form a solid construction on the riverbed. You won’t be given a new licence for an existing solid stage if you’re the new owner. Private domestic frontages and non-residential leisure plots Your structure should: be free of any garden ornament, furniture, shelter, trellis, fencing, screening or planting in or over any part of the river channel be positioned away from neighbouring boundaries to allow any neighbour clear navigable access and clear line of sight from their frontage in either direction not obstruct your neighbours’ sight lines by more than 45 degrees from the bankline ahead (except where the bankline is already subdivided into small plots and it’s considered reasonable to permit the whole frontage to be used for a boat) Working boatyards If you want to apply for a licence to extend an existing commercial mooring area in or over the main channel of the River Thames, you’ll need to show: this will benefit other users of the river, eg provide public landing or mooring rights or environmental enhancements it doesn’t negatively affect navigation or normal river and flood flow Waterside amenities at riverside hotels, bars and restaurants If you own a riverside hotel, bar or restaurant you can apply for a licence to provide fixed landing stages or pontoons for short-stay temporary mooring. The structure should only encroach into the river as much as is reasonably necessary to fulfil its purpose. You can ask the Environment Agency for permission to have a seating area on the structure. They will appoint a private consultant to assess the commercial benefit of a seating area and then add this as an additional fee for you to pay. If you’re given permission, you must only place outdoor tables and chairs for customers on areas of spare decking approved by the Environment Agency. Areas that you can use will be shown on the licence plan and on the deck itself. The landing area must not be furnished with tables, chairs or other garden furniture. Associated walkways should be kept clear. Licence fees: private You must get a private licence if the structure is for your own private use. You need to pay an administration fee of £50 to get your licence, plus an annual fee. Annual licence fees for structures are calculated by the square metre (maximum length of the structure multiplied by its width). This is known as its overall projection into the river.

/government/news/environment-agency-winning-the-war-on-destructive-invasive-fish,"The Environment Agency has moved one step closer to winning its war against a tiny yet destructive invasive fish Environment Agency winning the war on destructive invasive fish  Environment Agency Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs The Environment Agency has moved one step closer to winning its war against a destructive invasive fish which has been wreaking havoc in the country’s lakes and ponds. Topmouth gudgeon outcompete native fish for food and habitat, and spread disease. At their peak, a decade ago, topmouth gudgeon had been found widely spread across the UK at 23 locations. But after today’s (17 February) operation, and through the Environment Agency’s targeted removal, there are now just three remaining sites in England. This is not the first time that the Environment Agency has led the complete removal of an invasive species. The fathead minnow was eliminated in 2008 followed by the black bullhead catfish last year. Smaller than an average thumb, what topmouth gudgeon (pseudorasbora parva) lack in size they make up for with quantity. They breed up to four times a year and as a result can form vast populations. Their sheer numbers mean that they impact native fish by outcompeting them for food and habitat. This in turn means fewer invertebrates available to other fish and wildlife and upsets the natural balance of a lake or pond. Topmouth gudgeon also eat the eggs of other fish and carry a parasite. Native to Asia, it is thought that they were introduced to Britain in the 1980s from mainland Europe and potentially spread through fish farm movements and the ornamental fish trade. Today expert fisheries officers, kitted out in specialist protective gear, were on-site for this latest operation at three ponds in Hackney, north London. Sarah Chare, head of fisheries at the Environment Agency, said: “Invasive species pose a serious threat to our native wildlife and cost the UK economy a massive £1.8 billion a year. Topmouth gudgeon are on our hit list of the UK’s most damaging invasive species and despite only being tiny have devastating effects on fisheries and angling. “While Britain’s rivers are the healthiest for more than 20 years, rivers and ponds that harbour non-native species can have their water quality and ecology affected and could fall short of tough EU targets.” It is not certain how the topmouth gudgeon first found their way to the ponds in Hackney but experts believe it is likely that they were dumped illegally. The Environment Agency is urging people who own fish that the apparently harmless action of releasing unwanted fish into a local pond can have disastrous long-term effects on the environment and other animals within it. To ensure the continued success of this work, the Environment Agency is asking members of the public to report any sightings of topmouth gudgeon, or other invasive fish species to its incident hotline on 03708 506506, via email at: email: non-natives@environment-agency.gov.uk or via the AquaInvaders app downloadable here . Everyone can do their bit to help prevent the spread of invasive species by following the principles of the ‘Be Plantwise’ campaign and not dumping aquatic plants in the wild and always disposing of old plants and pond material responsibly, and by composting or using a green waste bin. By following the tips of the ‘Check, Clean, Dry’ campaign , anglers, boaters and canoeists can help prevent the spread of invasive species between waterways. The ponds are owned by Hackney Council. The reinstatement and management of the ponds following eradication will be decided by Hackney Council."

/government/news/food-stars-celebrate-the-future-of-uk-food-and-drink,"New government award recognises the rising stars of Britain’s food and drink industry. Food Stars celebrate the future of UK food and drink  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Fifty of the country’s most promising food and drink entrepreneurs are to be recognised as Food Stars for their contribution to the UK’s growing economy. The 50 Food Stars, carefully selected from hundreds of award-winning businesses, range from fiery Scotch bonnet pepper sauce makers in Scotland to chocolatiers using Indian spices in London. The revival of UK food and drink has seen a new generation of entrepreneurs emerge, whose innovative ideas and can-do attitude are creating jobs in local communities and contributing to the record £103 billion generated by the food chain last year. Leading figures in retail and food—including Justin King, former CEO of Sainsbury’s, and Dame Fiona Kendrick, CEO of Nestle UK and Ireland—will launch the Food Stars scheme on Thursday to help the winners grow their businesses and get more of their produce on supermarket shelves and dinner tables in the UK and across the world. The first initiative of its kind, Food Stars is part of a wider government drive to inspire entrepreneurial activity across the UK as part of our long-term economic plan. Launching the Food Stars network, Environment Secretary Elizabeth Truss said: “We are a nation of firsts; we invented self-raising flour and introduced the first modern chocolate bar. As a country we’ve always been a place where sparky entrepreneurs come up with great innovations in food and drink, people with the ambition to grow and take on the world. “Now is the time to celebrate that success which is helping grow our economy - that is why we’ve created Food Stars to recognise the bright innovators of today and support them to become the major players of tomorrow. “From chutney made from fruit and veg that would otherwise be thrown away, to chorizo made from British pigs in Yorkshire, our 50 Food Stars truly represent the best of British and demonstrate the creativity and determination in which this country takes pride. “Our Food Stars show if you want to see a vision for Britain’s bright economic future, look no further than the UK’s food and drink industry.” Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury, Priti Patel, said: “These are exciting times for the UK food and drink industry, as British brands have never been stronger worldwide. Now is the time to take advantage of the opportunity to create some world-class products that will compete on an international level and create jobs and growth for the UK in the process.” Food and farming remains the biggest manufacturing sector in Britain, employing 1 in 8 people. There is no better time to join the growing number of innovators in food and drink – in 2013 entrepreneurs set up 30,000 new food and drink businesses generating thousands of jobs in the sector. The industry’s continual innovation is bringing 16,000 new products to the market each year—more than France and Germany combined. Our Food Stars are helping to grow this sector even further. Exports of UK food and drink are also booming with almost £19 billion worth shipped to more than 150 countries in 2013. Since 2010 the UK government has opened more than 600 new international markets supporting more businesses to sell their produce abroad. Following Thursday’s launch, where 50 of the Food Stars will attend master classes on topics from exporting through to social media, they will receive a package of continued support from the Food and Drink Federation (FDF) and Cranfield University over the next year. This includes a tailored information service and access to a range of events and development opportunities in agriculture and food, the environment, management and leadership.

Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs): registration, disposal, labelling Chemicals Environment Agency Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs You must follow this guide if you own polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ), or any of the following substances that are also collectively known as PCBs : polychlorinated terphenyls monomethyl-dibromo-diphenyl methane monomethyl-dichloro-diphenyl methane monomethyl-tetrachlorodiphenyl methane You must also follow this guide if you own or operate equipment or material that contains any of these PCBs at a concentration higher than 50 parts per million (0.005%) Ban on PCBs PCBs are banned. You must dispose of PCBs , and equipment or material that contains them, as soon as possible, unless they’re covered by an exception. Exceptions to the PCB ban Research or disposal The ban doesn’t apply to PCBs held: for research and analysis into the properties of PCBs as part of a process to dispose of PCBs (eg at a hazardous waste disposal site) or a process to remove (‘decontaminate’) PCBs from equipment Transformers You can continue to use transformers if the fluid in the transformer has a PCB concentration below 500 parts per million (0.05%.) You must dispose of the transformer as soon as possible after the end of its useful life. Small components of equipment You can continue to use small pieces of equipment that contain PCBs if both of the following apply: they’re not contaminated equipment they’re components of larger pieces of equipment, which aren’t contaminated equipment either The exception for smaller equipment is meant to avoid you having to destroy or damage a large piece of equipment to remove the PCBs contained in a small component. The exception doesn’t apply if it’s practical for you to remove the smaller component and get rid of the PCBs without damaging the larger machine. Contaminated equipment ( CE ) Any equipment that contains more than 5 litres of fluid containing PCBs (ie more than 5 litres of fluid that has a PCB concentration of more than 0.005%) is classed as ‘contaminated equiment’ ( CE ). You must generally assume the following equipment is CE if it was manufactured before 1987 and contains more than 5 litres of fluid: power factor capacitors heat transfer equipment pole-mounted transformers process heating equipment vacuum pumps high temperature hydraulic systems electrical resistors brushings and other high voltage equipment fluorescent light ballasts hospital diagnostic equipment You don’t have to assume such equipment is CE if you’re certain it doesn’t contain PCBs , for example if you have: carried out tests on the equipment that showed it doesn’t contain PCBs kept the original manufacturers’ mannual and it shows the equipment doesn’t contain PCBs If you’re not certain whether your equipment contains PCBs , you must assume it does. Combined sets of equipment Email chemicalrestrictions@environment-agency.gov.uk if you hold several pieces of equipment that wouldn’t be classed as CE on their own, but are part of a combined set, which would be classed as CE . This would apply, for example, if you have a piece of equipment that contains multiple capacitors which individually contain less than 5 litres of fluid, but collectively contain more than 5 litres of fluid. The Environment Agency will discuss this with you on a case-by-case basis. Register CE You must register any CE that you own with the Environment Agency, including CE that: has a legal use (eg transformers with a PCB concentration below 0.05%) doesn’t have a legal use, but you haven’t disposed of yet (you’ll also need to tell the Environment Agency how you plan to dispose of it as soon as possible) Complete a PCB holdings registration form and return it to the Environment Agency as soon as possible. You must re-register your equipment every year until you stop holding CE . To do this send a new PCB holdings registration form to the Environment Agency, listing all CE you hold on 31 July each year. You must pay a £155 fee every year when you submit your PCB holdings registration form. If you become the owner of CE (eg if you buy a business that operates such equipment), you must register the equipment even if it’s been registered before. Take CE off the register You can take contaminated equipment off the PCB register: after you have disposed of it if you sell it, or you sell the business or site it was part of if you have carried out tests that prove it doesn’t contain PCBs if you have decontaminated it, so that the PCB content of the fluid is less than 0.005% You can take equipment off the register at any time by completing the ‘de-registering equipment’ section of the PCB holdings registration form and returning it to the Environment Agency. There’s no charge for deregistering equipment. Labelling CE and premises You must attach a label to any CE stating that the equipment is contaminated with PCBs . You must also attach a sign to the premises where the equipment is used stating that the premises contains equipment contaminated by PCBs . You must make sure the labels and signs are clearly visible and can’t be easily removed. For transformers where the fluid has a PCB content of less than 0.05%, your label and sign can say, ‘ PCBs contaminated <0.05%’. Dispose of PCBs You must dispose of PCBs and materials that contain PCBs as a persistent organic pollutant (POP) and hazardous waste. That means you can either: dispose of the PCBSs or equipment in such a way that destroys the PCB content apply to permanently store the equipment underground if you can’t destroy the PCB content Email chemicalrestrictions@environment-agency.gov.uk to discuss how to do this. You must keep records to show that you disposed of the PCBs by one of these two methods."

/guidance/control-dogs,"Powers that police, councils and other authorities can use to control or improve the behaviour of dogs. Control dogs  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Police, councils and other authorities can take action against a dangerous or banned dog . Any or a combination of the following powers can also be used if a dog is causing, or is likely to cause, nuisance or harm: a community protection notice a civil injunction (a type of injunction that focuses on antisocial behaviour) a criminal behaviour order Councils can also restrict what dogs can do in a public space, eg banning dogs from the area or requiring them to be on leads. This is known as a public spaces protection order . Other ways to help improve dog behaviour can be as effective as legal action. These include educating dog owners or giving a warning to offenders. The order or civil injunction used depends on the type, frequency and severity of the behaviour. It must only include reasonable measures for the person responsible for the dog to take. Reasonable measures You must only include measures that can be enforced in an order or civil injunction. These must also be reasonable for a person responsible for the dog to take. They can include: microchipping - compulsory for every dog from 6 April 2016 restricting where a dog can go, and when, eg by putting it on a lead keeping the dog on a lead muzzling the dog, eg around children neutering the dog fixing fences installing a letter cage (to protect anyone delivering post) cleaning kennels and disposing of dog waste attending classes (eg to educate the dog owner or to train the dog) specifying how old you have to be to look after the dog with antisocial behaviour, preventing the owner from meeting named individuals with the dog Be clear about both of the following: what you want your measures to achieve how long it should take for your measures to be achieved Consult with relevant experts, e.g. a vet or a dog legislation officer ( DLO ) , before you issue the order or civil injunction. When measures include attending a dog-training course, the enforcer (eg police officer) should arrange the course using a suitable trainer. You can find a trainer from the Animal Behaviour Training Council or the Kennel Club . You can ask the trainer to confirm that the course has been attended, eg in writing. Community protection notice A community protection notice ( CPN ) orders the person responsible for the dog (usually the dog owner) to stop or control its behaviour. A CPN is usually issued to deal with minor incidents, including when a dog: strays causes alarm damages property shows it’s capable of aggression A CPN orders the responsible person to: stop doing something, eg letting the dog into children’s play areas do specified things, eg muzzling the dog take reasonable steps to get specific results, eg attending dog-training classes A CPN can last for as long as the authority issuing it believes is necessary (eg, 2 weeks to fix a fence, or several months to allow someone to attend a training course). Who can issue a CPN A CPN can be issued by a: police officer police community support officer ( PCSO ) who’s been authorised to issue it council officer registered social landlord ( RSL ) approved by the council You can only issue a CPN if the dog’s behaviour is persistent, unreasonable and negatively affects the quality of life of people or animals. You must issue a written warning before you can issue a CPN . Written warning before a CPN The written warning doesn’t have to follow a specific format but it must state: the behaviour that’s led to this warning being issued a reasonable time period in which the behaviour must stop what happens if they’re issued with a CPN and the penalties for not following a CPN ‘Reasonable time’ depends on the specific circumstances, for example: 10 minutes may be reasonable to put a lead on a dog that’s out of control in a park 1 week may be reasonable for fixing a fence that a dog keeps escaping through. You or the person responsible for the dog may need time to get advice from experts on animal welfare or dog law, eg a vet or DLO , on complying with the warning. Before issuing a CPN You must inform anyone else who needs to know about the CPN , before you issue it. These parties can include: the council the police animal welfare organisations (if relevant) the landlord of the person you’re issuing it to You should also inform the person who first reported the dog’s behaviour. Who you can issue a CPN to A CPN can be issued to: someone aged 16 or over an organisation or business If a child under 16 is responsible for the dog, the CPN can be issued to the parent or guardian. A CPN can be issued to more than one person if more than one person is responsible for the dog. Penalties for breaking a CPN If someone doesn’t comply with a CPN , they can be given an on-the-spot fine of £100 (a ‘fixed penalty notice’). They could also be prosecuted in a magistrate’s court and be: fined - up to £2,500 for individuals, up to £20,000 for a body forced to pay costs, eg money a council spent to fix a fence that allowed a dog to escape The court can issue an order for items to be seized and disposed of (a ‘forfeiture notice’) within 14 days. This can include an order for a dog to be taken away from its owner or destroyed. A dog should only be removed or destroyed if there is no other option to keep animals or the public safe. CPN appeals The person responsible for the dog can appeal within 21 days of receiving a CPN , if they believe any of its measures are unreasonable (eg they could harm the dog or are too expensive). If someone wants to appeal against costs they’ve been asked to pay after breaking a CPN , they must do so within 21 days. Civil injunction A civil injunction can be issued against someone aged 10 or over who’s using, or threatening to use, a dog in antisocial behaviour, eg when intimidating someone. A civil injunction is usually issued: to deal with more serious antisocial behaviour than that covered by a CPN when the person responsible for the dog has previously been told to change their behaviour but hasn’t done so If the owner or dog’s behaviour is harmful or likely to harm others, a civil injunction can include the power to arrest someone immediately. A civil injunction can be issued by: a police officer a council officer an RSL approved by a council the Environment Agency ( EA ) Natural Resources Wales ( NRB ) Transport for London ( TfL ) NHS Protect Public Health Wales A civil injunction can last: indefinitely, for over-18s up to a year, for under-18s You must consult your local youth offending team before issuing a civil injunction against someone under 18. When a civil injunction can be issued A court must approve your request for a civil injunction before it’s issued. You can apply if you believe the behaviour, based on the ‘balance of probability’ (in other words, more likely than not) causes: harassment, alarm or distress to a person, in public places such as town centres or shopping areas nuisance or annoyance if it’s happening inside someone’s home - this includes nuisance or annoyance to anyone outside of the home, eg a neighbour Before issuing a civil injunction You’ll need to compile a case based on the balance of probability with evidence that supports your request. Apply for a civil injunction at: a county court or the high court, for adults a youth court, for under-18s Penalties for breaking a civil injunction An over-18 could get up to 2 years in prison or an unlimited fine if they don’t comply with a civil injunction. An under-18 could get a supervision order or a detention order. Civil injunction appeals Appeals against a civil injunction are made: to the high court, for over-18s to a crown court, for under-18s Criminal behaviour order A criminal behaviour order ( CBO ) can be issued to anyone aged 10 or over who has both: been convicted of a criminal offence already shown persistent and serious antisocial behaviour A CBO can deal with a wide range of antisocial behaviour to: prevent or stop it deal with its causes, eg if a dog has already attacked someone and the local community believes the owner can’t control it Police or councils must provide evidence and ask a prosecutor, usually the Crown Prosecution Service ( CPS ), to apply for the CBO . The hearing will take place either after or at the same time as sentencing for the criminal conviction. An appropriate person, eg DLO or animal welfare officer, must supervise CBO requirements. The CBO must state who this person is. A CBO can last: 1 to 3 years, for under-18s 2 years to indefinitely, for over-18s When a CBO can be issued A CBO can only be issued when the court believes that all of these conditions are met: it’s ‘beyond reasonable doubt’ that the offender’s behaviour caused or was likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress to a person the CBO will help prevent the offender from repeating the behaviour If an offender is under 18, prosecutors must consult a youth offending team before applying for the CBO . Penalties for breaking a CBO If an over-18 breaks a CBO they could be given one or both of the following: an unlimited fine up to 5 years in prison For under-18s, hearings take place in a youth court. The maximum sentence is 2 years in either: a secure children’s home a secure training centre a young offender institution Changing, ending or extending a CBO The court that made the CBO may change (‘vary’), end (‘discharge’) or extend it. The court can also add extra conditions onto it. The offender or the prosecution can apply for a CBO to be varied or discharged. If the court rejects the application, you can’t apply again without the court’s consent. CBO appeals Appeals against CBOs must be made to: a crown court, if the CBO was made in a magistrate or youth court the court of appeal, if the CBO was made in a crown court Annual review for under-18s The police and council must annually review any CBO issued against an under-18 to: make sure they’re complying with it properly check whether the CBO needs to be varied or discharged The police and council can ask anyone relevant, eg a youth offending team, to take part in the review. Public spaces protection order Councils can use a public spaces protection order ( PSPO ) to place restrictions on a public area, such as a park or a town centre. Restrictions can apply to either: all dog owners owners who meet specific conditions set out by the council Councils can make a PSPO unless they’re: a parish or town council in England a community council in Wales PSPO restrictions include: limiting how many dogs can be walked by an owner at one time requiring dogs to be on a lead in a specific public area requiring owners to pick up their dog’s litter preventing dogs from being in a certain place, eg a children’s play area in a park A PSPO lasts up to 3 years and can be renewed. When a PSPO can be issued Because a PSPO is applied to a whole public area rather than to individuals, it should be used carefully. Consider whether there can be exceptions for working dogs, eg assistance dogs. A PSPO can only be issued when a dog’s behaviour meets these conditions: it’s affecting or is likely to affect the quality of life of people in the area it’s persistent it justifies imposing restrictions on a whole public area If a PSPO restricts local people’s space to walk dogs, you should provide other space to do this. Before issuing a PSPO The council must consult the following before issuing a PSPO : the chief officer for the police area the area’s police and crime commissioner representatives of people who it believes will be affected by the restrictions, eg residents associations or people who use the area the owner or occupier of the land dog law and welfare experts, eg vets or animal welfare officers organisations affected by the restrictions Find out more about PSPOs . Police: Dog legislation officer Every police service should have a trained dog legislation officer ( DLO ). If it doesn’t, it must have procedures in place so that it can access a DLO . The DLO should be someone who is both: trained in dog law understands how to identify a banned dog The DLO must be able to act as a single point of contact for anyone investigating dog-related crimes."

Councils must give landowners or occupiers 15 days’ notice and can only remove vehicles with their permission. National park authorities must remove vehicles abandoned in national parks. Authorities don’t have to remove abandoned vehicles if the cost of moving them to the nearest highway is unreasonably high (for example, if special machinery is needed), unless the vehicle is on a carriageway. Authorities can’t be held liable for damage resulting from abandoned cars. Read guidance for taking legal action against nuisance vehicles . Penalties you can give To penalise people who abandon vehicles or parts of vehicles on roads or land open to the air, you can do one of the following: issue a fixed penalty notice (if the offence is relatively minor) prosecute them Work out if a vehicle is abandoned Councils must work out if vehicles are abandoned. This is likely if one of the following applies: they have no keeper on the DVLA ’s database and are untaxed - check with DVLA as vehicles no longer have to display a tax disc they’re stationary for a significant amount of time they’re significantly damaged, run down or unroadworthy - with flat tyres, wheels removed or broken windows they’re burned out they have number plates missing Councils can legally enter land (at a reasonable time) to investigate and remove abandoned vehicles. Finding vehicle owners Use the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency’s (DVLAs) database to find vehicle owners.

/government/news/garden-of-england-cultivates-the-future-for-fruit,"Government backing means scientists in Kent are ensuring we can grow more, buy more and sell more British fruit whatever the weather. Garden of England cultivates the future for fruit  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Government backing means scientists in Kent are ensuring we can grow more, buy more and sell more British fruit whatever the weather, announced Farming Minister George Eustice today. Thanks to £1.9 million in Government support, researchers at the National Fruit Collection in Faversham can identify the varieties of fruit most resilient to extreme weather conditions. From apples that can withstand drought to cherries and plums that can flourish in heavy rain, the vital research on the Defra-owned collection is helping to safeguard the future of British farming and ensure we can enjoy the best of British all year round – whatever the weather. With access to more than 3,500 different fruit varieties, the ground-breaking research is also revolutionising the types of fruit we eat – a ‘micro pear’ was discovered in the archives of the National Fruit Collection by a major supermarket. Visiting the research centre after spending the morning at the Fruit Focus show in East Malling, which celebrates the latest technologies and developments across the soft and orchard fruit industry, Minister George Eustice commented: “Our world-leading scientific research and strong fruit-growing heritage means scientists are finding new ways to ensure our food and farming industry continues to thrive. “These developments mean UK consumers can enjoy our delicious berries, apples and pears come rain or shine and will also bring new opportunities for growers looking to export quality produce.” This year has been a bumper year for fruit crops, with near-perfect conditions resulting in six times as many apricots and 20 per cent more home-grown cherries than in 2014. With worldwide exports of British apples worth £16.3 million in 2013 —double the value in 2010 — there is real potential to further grow the fruit market to create jobs and boost the UK economy. Dr Matthew Ordidge, Scientific Curator for the National Fruit Collection at Brogdale, added: “It’s hard not to be astounded by the range of varieties in the National Fruit Collection and I’m extremely proud to have a role in research to increase fruit resilience, ensuring that even as changing weather patterns affect crops, we can continue producing fruit for the nation. “The bank of open data and the collection are recognised as international assets, and we invite researchers, breeders and growers to make the most of them.”"

Industry negotiations result in Channel scallop deal Regulations, monitoring and enforcement Marine Management Organisation Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs The extra fishing days were confirmed after industry-led negotiations between UK and French representatives, which have been taking place since the start of the year. Vessels in the UK over-15 metre scallop fleet have secured an additional 18 effort days each under the Western Waters regime for the whole of 2014. The Marine Management Organisation (MMO) has issued fishing vessel licence variations allowing UK scallop fishing vessels to benefit from extra effort in the English Channel in exchange for them observing area closures. In return, UK scallop fishermen in the over-15 metre scallop fleet agreed not to fish in area VIId (eastern English Channel) in August and September, in certain areas of French waters in VIId between August and November and to a closure of an area further west off the French coast within Area VIIe between August and December. This is an area where there are sensitivities around the use of fixed fishing gears, which resulted in the tension between English and French fleets in October 2012. France agreed to give the UK 720,000 Western Waters kilowatt (KW) days, 50,000 for use before 1 October 2014 north of the median line between the UK and France and a further 670,000 for use after 1 October 2014. Fisheries Minister George Eustice said: “I congratulate industry on securing this deal, which will give UK scallop fishermen more days at sea - the agreement is a positive move for both sides.” Fishing vessel licence variations are published on the MMO website and are also promoted through the MMO’s Twitter account and Facebook page."

/government/news/plastic-bag-numbers-rise-for-the-fifth-year,"British shoppers took 8.5 billion single-use carrier bags from major supermarkets in 2014. Plastic bag numbers rise for the fifth year  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Find out more about what the carrier bag charge means for consumers and retailers . The number of plastic bags taken from supermarkets has increased for the fifth year running – despite research from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs showing that the average household already has 40 plastic bags stashed away around the home. New figures released today show British shoppers took 8.5 billion single-use carrier bags from major supermarkets in 2014 – up two hundred million from 2013. Plastic bags can take years to fully decompose and even though household recycling rates have improved significantly in recent years, 16,000 tonnes of waste still goes to landfill every year. Around 8 million tonnes of plastic also ends up in our oceans each year, polluting our marine environment and harming our precious sea life. Commenting on the research, Resource Minister Rory Stewart said: We’re all guilty of taking a carrier bag from a supermarket, storing it somewhere safe at home with the intention of using it again, then forgetting to take it with us next time we go to the shops. But the more bags we take, the more plastic makes its way into our environment, blighting our high streets, spoiling our enjoyment of the countryside, and damaging our wildlife and marine environments. Simple changes to our shopping routines, such as taking our own bags with us or using more bags for life, can make a huge difference in reducing the amount of plastic in circulation meaning we can all enjoy a cleaner, healthier country. The latest figures on plastic bag usage come ahead of the introduction of the 5p charge for single-use plastic carrier bags, which comes into effect in England in October following the success of similar schemes in Scotland and Wales. In Wales the charge led to an 79% decrease in plastic bags taken in the first three years and in Scotland the number of ‘bags for life’ used quadrupled last year. By comparison, in England ‘bags for life’ only account for one in 20 bags taken from major retailers. This new charge will directly address the number of plastic carrier bags distributed by large supermarkets and small businesses are invited to introduce a charge on a voluntary basis. Rory Stewart added: Countries with the 5p charge have seen a dramatic fall in the number of plastic bags taken from supermarkets and we can expect a significant reduction in England, possibly by as much as 80% in supermarkets and 50% on the high street. The charge will also boost our growing economy by delivering savings of £60 million in litter clean-up costs and £13 million in carbon savings. Good causes will also benefit from the charge, and as much as £730 million could be donated to charities and not-for-profit organisations over 10 years.

Watch our short video for consumers and others explaining the 5p charge for single-use plastic carrier bags: Single-use plastic carrier bag charge Transcript of commentary on video: From 5 October 2015, large shops in England will have to charge five pence for all single use plastic carrier bags they provide. In 2013, the major supermarkets in England gave out over 7.4 billion plastic bags – that’s 133 bags for every person. To protect our environment from litter and pollution we are committed to bringing this number down. The five pence charge on single use plastic carrier bags could reduce usage by as much as 80% in the big supermarkets. Small retailers don’t have to charge but can do so on a voluntary basis. You can avoid paying the charge either by reusing single use plastic carrier bags, or by using multi-use bags for life. You also won’t pay a five pence charge if you’re using a paper bag, if you’re in transit, or if your bag only contains certain items, such as unwrapped food, raw meat and fish, prescription medicines, uncovered blades, seeds, bulbs and flowers, or live fish. Retailers need to keep track of how many plastic bags they’ve given out and where the proceeds have gone … and report this to Government by 31 May every year. We expect good causes to benefit from the charge by tens of millions of pounds each year."

It follows the success of similar schemes in Scotland and Wales – in Wales the charge led to a 79 per cent decrease in plastic bags in three years. Read information for consumers and retailers about England’s 5p carrier bag charge In 2014, 7.64 billion single use plastic bags were given out by major supermarkets in England.

/guidance/parish-councils-fixed-penalty-notices,"Your powers to issue fixed penalty notices for environmental offences including litter, graffiti, fly-posting and dog control order offences. Parish councils: fixed penalty notices  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Fixed penalty notices ( FPNs ) can be used by parish councils to deal with environmental offences like litter and graffiti. They give offenders the chance to pay a fine instead of being prosecuted. If the offender doesn’t pay the fine within 14 days, you should prosecute them (unless you later decide that the FPN shouldn’t have been issued). Your enforcement powers As a parish council, you can issue fixed penalty notices ( FPNs ) for the following offences: litter graffiti fly-posting breaching dog control orders When dealing with local environmental crime, parish councils have different powers to higher tier local authorities. Find out more about how FPNs are issued and enforced by local authorities . Deciding whether to use your powers You can choose to issue FPNs for some offences but not for others, depending on your area’s needs. For example, you can choose to issue FPNs to people who litter but not to people who make graffiti. Announcing your powers You should publicise all of the following: which powers you plan to use how you’ll enforce them when you’ll start using them You must consider any comments from the public when deciding how to enforce your powers. You should only use FPNs if you’re prepared to take court action if the fine is unpaid. Working with your district council If you’re considering using your powers to issue FPNs , you should discuss it with your district council. This is to make sure that your work doesn’t duplicate or conflict with their work. You can also ask your district council about working with other local parish councils to develop a shared enforcement service to issue FPNs . Setting fixed penalty levels Penalties for litter, graffiti and fly-posting You must use the penalty level set by your district council for litter, graffiti and fly-posting. Penalties for offences under dog control orders You can set or change the level of fixed penalty for dog control orders ( DCOs ) that you have created. You must set the level between £50 and £80. Within these limits, you can set different penalty levels for different offences. For DCOs set up by the district council, you must use the level that it has set. If it hasn’t set a level, you must use the default level of £75. Offering discounts for fixed penalty notices You can offer an early payment discount for all fixed penalties. While you must use the same penalty level as your district council (except for DCO offences) you may offer a different early payment discount, within the set limits. The minimum discounted rate for all these fixed penalties is £50. You don’t have to offer an early payment discount. Spending the money from penalties You can spend the income from all FPNs that you issue in your parish. You must spend it on functions relating to FPNs , eg enforcement staff, for any of the following: litter graffiti and fly-posting controls on dogs Quality parish councils If you’re an approved quality parish council, you can use the income from any FPN that you issue for any of your functions. Recruiting enforcement staff You can use your existing staff to issue FPNs but parish councillors must not act as enforcement officers. You should read the FPN guidance for more information, eg on how to equip your enforcement officers. Using district council staff You may be able to buy or trade some time from your district council’s enforcement staff. This could save you from having to pay to hire or manage new staff of your own. Training enforcement staff You must make sure any enforcement officers you’ve authorised, including parish council staff, have completed the approved training course organised by Keep Britain Tidy Network Email: training@keepbritaintidy.org Police community support officers ( PCSOs ) don’t have to attend the training. Issuing FPNs for dog control order offences ( DCOs ) You can issue FPNs for offences against your DCOs and your district council’s DCOs in your parish. People who use trained assistance dogs, eg guide dogs, are exempt from DCOs . FPNs can’t be offered as an alternative to prosecution for offences against a byelaw (these were used before DCOs for offences like dog fouling). You can no longer make new DCOs . You can still change or revoke existing DCOs . Dealing with fly-posting As a parish council, you can only issue FPNs against the person who put up the posters. You can’t issue FPNs to other people who may benefit from the fly-posting, eg a club owner whose event is being promoted. Your district council can take action against the beneficiaries so you should give them any information you have. Major fly-posting Any commercial fly-posting, except the most minor, should be pursued through the magistrates’ court. You should take action through the magistrates’ court if many sites in your parish have been fly-posted. You should pass details to your district council and the police. Removing fly-posting You don’t have to remove fly-posting. The district council should remove it as it can recover its costs. You should inform your district council immediately if the fly-posting is of an offensive nature, eg it’s explicit or features racism. Legislation This guidance is not a substitute for legal advice and you should read the relevant legislation: Environmental Protection Act 1990 Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005 Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2003 Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014 Environmental Offences (Fixed Penalties) (Miscellaneous Provisions) Regulations 2007 Environmental Offences (Use of Fixed Penalty Receipts) Regulations 2007 The Dog Control Orders (Prescribed Offences and Penalties, etc.) Regulations 2006"

/government/news/mackerel-agreement-and-support-for-fisheries-affected-by-russian-ban,"Last week the UK government achieved two key agreements in Europe which will support our fishermen and mackerel industry. Mackerel agreement and support for fisheries affected by Russian ban  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Mackerel agreement reached On Friday, a long term management strategy was signed between the EU, Faroe Islands and Norway to support the long-term future of North East Atlantic Mackerel stocks and deliver vital stability for UK fishermen. While the agreement will see a 15% cut in the quota for 2016, it has been welcomed by industry as a fair deal for fishermen in light of the challenges facing these vital stocks. Having lobbied to avoid more severe reductions, we have struck the right balance between supporting industry and our fish stocks, and the UK can now expect to receive around 208,000 tonnes of mackerel quota in 2016. This agreement is worth around £200m to our fleet, which includes around £130m for the Scottish fleet based in key ports such as Fraserburgh, Peterhead and Lerwick. As part of our long-term, international strategy we will also be collaborating with Member States on a new fish egg survey to ensure we have access to the very latest science and data we need to protect mackerel stock for the future of our industry. Commenting on this agreement, Fisheries Minister George Eustice said: Mackerel is the UK’s most valuable stock and Friday’s agreement represents a good deal for the UK, and particularly Scottish fishermen. As well as careful quota management to protect the long term future of this fishery, we must also ensure the scientific advice we use to agree fishing levels is as robust as possible. Our contribution to next year’s comprehensive egg survey will play an essential role in securing the data we need to safeguard the marine environment and ensure we have enough mackerel for generations of fishermen. UK government secures support for fisheries affected by Russian ban The mackerel deal comes hours after another agreement which will see fishermen affected by the Russian food import ban benefitting from further EU-wide support thanks to lobbying by the UK government. Late on Thursday evening, the UK led efforts to secure EU measures so that fishermen can ‘bank’ a higher proportion of their 2015 quota for some pelagic stocks to use next year. The agreement reached at a meeting of the EU Council of Fisheries Ministers will mean that, for example, up to around 42,500 tonnes of UK 2015 mackerel quota would be available for use in 2016. This agreement continues the flexibility in managing quotas for stocks impacted by the Russian import ban. Fisheries Minister George Eustice said: Thursday’s success is a good example of industry and Government working together to deliver practical help and shows the UK’s leadership in Europe. This agreement will continue to help underpin confidence in the market, enabling industry to find alternative markets for fish that would have been exported to Russia. Further information There will be a further Coastal States Meeting on 14/15 November which seeks to bring Iceland, and possibly Russia into this new agreement. EU rules limit banking of quota into the following fishing year to 10%. This year, the UK government secured around 243,000 tonnes of mackerel quota for UK fishermen. According to 2013 data, Russia’s market for our fisheries accounts for 18% of our mackerel exports and generated £16m. For the stocks of interest to the UK, fishermen will be eligible to bank: 17.5% of the following stocks of 2015 UK quota for use in 2016: North Sea mackerel Western mackerel 25% of the following stocks of 2015 quota for use in 2016: Western horse mackerel North Sea herring Atlanto-Scandian herring"

/guidance/commons-registers-apply-to-record-historic-events,"Find out how you can apply to change the commons registers to record a historic event. Commons registers: apply to record historic events Land management Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs You can apply to update the register with historic events that should have been recorded in the registers of common land or of town or village greens, but weren’t. Historic events are those that happened between: 3 January 1970 and 30 September 2008 (inclusive) in the areas of: Blackburn with Darwen Council Cornwall Council Devon County Council (but not including Plymouth or Torbay) County of Herefordshire District Council Hertfordshire County Council Kent County Council (but not including Medway) Lancashire County Council (but not including Blackpool) 3 January 1970 and 14 December 2014 (inclusive) in the areas of: Cumbria County Council North Yorkshire County Council It’s not yet possible to apply to record a historic event in any other area. Apply using form CA14 . You can apply on your own or with others. You’ll be applying under Schedule 3. Find more information about applying to change the commons registers to help you with your application. Apply during the transitional period The transitional period for Blackburn with Darwen, Cornwall, Devon, Herefordshire, Hertfordshire, Kent and Lancashire has ended. Cumbria and North Yorkshire will operate a transitional period of 4 years (up to 14 December 2018). During the first 3 years (up to 14 December 2017), applications are free and there is no fairness test. In year 4, you may have to pay a fee, but there is no fairness test. After that the transitional period will close, and there will be both a fairness test and a fee (where relevant). The fairness test is about whether others may have reasonably relied on the unamended registers, so that it would be unfair to them to amend the registers now. Apply to record the historic creation of a right of common The right can have been created by any lawful means, including by grant (a deed) or by prescription (if the right has been asserted for a period of 20 years as of right and has not been challenged by the landowner). You should seek legal advice if you are unsure of the basis of any claim through prescription. The right of common need not be attached to land, but in Defra’s view, a right of common held in gross could only have been created by express grant. Who can apply You can apply if you’re: the owner of any part of the land over which the right of common is exercisable (in other words, the common land) the owner of the land to which the right is attached (such as a farmhouse), thereby allowing the owner to exercise the right the owner of the right in gross (attached to a person rather than attached to land) Interpretation There is considerable uncertainty whether a right of common can be acquired over land that is already registered as common land or a town or village green. This is because the 1965 Act provided that “no rights of common shall be exercisable over land capable of being registered as common land or as town or village green under the Act unless they are registered…”. In Defra’s view, these words had effect after 31 July 1970, the end of the period referred to in section 1(2) of the 1965 Act, and did not prevent the acquisition of new rights of common by prescription after that date, although regulations made under the 1965 Act prohibited the registration of a new right of common over existing registered land. The 2006 Act therefore leaves the door open to the possibility that rights of common can be acquired by prescription under the 1965 Act even in relation to existing registered land, but does not explicitly provide that they can be. In Defra’s view, a new right may be asserted over registered land provided that it was not in existence on 2 January 1970. A period of prescription beginning after 3 January 1950 may therefore be eligible for registration. but the matter cannot be regarded as settled, and will need to be determined by the registration authority if it arises. Equally, it may also be possible to assert the validity of a grant of a right of common over existing registered land. In such cases, however, the registration authority will need to consider whether the owner of the common was capable of granting a new right having regard to its impact on the exercise of any existing rights of common. For example, where the number of registered rights exercisable over a common under the 1965 Act exceeds the capacity of the common to sustain those rights, then in Defra’s view, any new grant would have been invalid at common law, and should not be registered on an application for the purposes of paragraph 2(2)(a) of Schedule 3. It is seldom likely that a new right of common could be acquired over a registered town or village green, without interfering with the neighbourhood’s right to use the green for sports and pastimes, and in Defra’s view, any application for that purpose will need to be scrutinised very carefully. Where an application relates to a new right of common that is exercisable over land that is not currently registered as common land, it will cause that land to become common land when it is recorded in the register. Apply to record a historic variation of a right of common You can apply to register a variation of a right of common that occurred during the relevant historic period. Who can apply You can apply if you’re: the owner of any part of the common land before the variation the owner of any part of the common land after the variation the owner of the dominant tenement to which the right of common is attached (such as a farmhouse) the registered owner of the right in gross If you’re the current owner of a right in gross that was varied but you’re not the registered owner, you must first apply under to register the transfer of ownership (see advice below on historic transfer of a right in gross). Interpretation A variation may relate to any aspect of the registered right, but most typically will comprise a variation in what may be done under the right (for example a variation of a right to graze 100 cattle so as to substitute a right to graze 600 sheep), but may also enable the right to be exercised over new or different land, or adjust the dominant tenement to which the right is attached. Apply to record a historic apportionment of a right of common You can apply to register an apportionment of a right of common that occurred during the relevant applicable historic period. Apportionment happens when the dominant tenement is divided into smaller lots. The apportionment can only be registered where it is a pre-requisite to another type of change to the right (‘the primary application’). The primary application will make one of the following changes to the right of common: extinguishment, surrender, variation or severance as a historic event under Schedule 3. Additionally, a primary application may be made as a result of a historic statutory disposition. You must submit your application to apportion rights at the same time as the primary application. You can also register an apportionment as a ‘new event’ (rather than a historic event) even where no primary application is involved. See advice on new events . An application to register an apportionment, where the apportionment arises from an instrument (for example conveyance) made on or after 28 June 2005, must be pro rata, meaning proportionate to its share of the former dominant tenement before it was divided up. Where the apportionment arises from an instrument made before 28 June 2005, the effect of paragraph 18(4) of Schedule 4 to the Regulations is that you cannot apportion the rights other than pro rata unless you supply evidence from that time that the parties to the instrument intended some other outcome. Such evidence is most likely to be found in the instrument itself (for example a clause in a conveyance of part of the dominant tenement which says the rights are not sold with the land but are reserved to the part of the dominant tenement retained by the seller). A declaration or other statement by you the applicant, or by the parties to the instrument made after the date of the instrument itself, will not be sufficient to indicate another outcome, and cannot satisfy the requirements of the regulation. Who can apply You can only apply if you have made the primary application. Apply to record a historic transfer of a right held in gross You can apply to register a transfer of a right of common in gross that happened during the relevant applicable historic period. The transfer of a right held in gross must be in writing, for example by conveyance. A right of common in gross can’t be transferred by an oral agreement. You will need to provide evidence as to how you acquired the right in gross. Who can apply You can apply if you’re: the person registered as the owner of the right of common (in other words, you owned the right before it was transferred to the new owner) the owner of the right of common at the date of application (in other words, you now own the right in gross) Apply to record a historic surrender or extinguishment of a right of common You can apply to register a surrender or extinguishment of a right of common that occurred during the relevant applicable historic period. Though they have different terms ‘surrender’ or ‘extinguishment’ have the same effect: the cancellation of the right from the register. A surrender will generally arise from a deed for extinguishment of the right agreed between the commoner and the common owner, whereas extinguishment may have arisen in consequence of a common-law event. Who can apply You can apply if you’re: the current owner of any part of the dominant tenement to which the right was attached the owner of the right in gross before it was surrendered or extinguished the current owner of any part of the servient tenement over which the right of common is exercisable Interpretation The common law mechanisms by which rights of common may be extinguished are: unity of ownership (or unity of seisin): where the common land and the right of common come into the same ownership (typically, where the dominant tenement to which a right is attached is acquired by the owner of the common), then the right is extinguished. (The effect of section 13(3) of the Commons Act 2006 is that rights acquired by the owner of the common will be exercisable by that person in the same way as the rights were exercisable by their former owner; meaning the right of common will no longer be extinguished) abandonment: where the owner of the rights can be shown to have irrevocably turned away from the use of the rights implied release: where a collective release of rights can be inferred over part of the common, typically where that part is inclosed by encroachment and the commoners acquiesce in the loss alteration to the common, comprising destruction of the common land (such as where the land is reclaimed by the sea) or exhaustion of the product (such as peat which is subject to rights of turbary) alteration to the dominant tenement, comprising the demolition (without replacement) of a building to which rights (particularly rights of turbary) are attached, or the conversion of land to which rights (such as grazing) are attached to a use incapable of benefiting from the right (such as a reservoir) The common law mechanisms above were abolished in the pioneer areas on 1 October 2008 and in Cumbria and North Yorkshire on 15 December 2014 (they have not been abolished in any other areas in England) by section 13(3) of the Commons Act 2006. But it does not affect the operation of the common law during the historic period. There remains some uncertainty as to whether the registration of rights of common under the 1965 Act modified (to any extent) the operation of the common law mechanisms, and these questions have not been considered by the courts: for example, it is unclear whether an application to remove a right of common from the register because it is alleged to have been abandoned, can succeed, because the very act of registration of the right under the 1965 Act might be said to have preserved a right from the intention to abandon it. In Defra’s view, the matter cannot be regarded as settled, and will need to be determined by the registration authority if it arises. In Defra’s view, an application to amend the register arising from any of these mechanisms cannot cause any land to cease to be registered as common land or green, because no provision is made in paragraph 2(2)(b) of Schedule 3 for the registration of such an outcome. So, for example, where an application is made to amend the register to remove a right of common because the land over which the right is exercisable has been destroyed by the sea, the registration authority may grant the application, but it has no power to amend the register so as to remove the common land from the register (even though the rights formerly exercisable over the land have been extinguished and the land no longer exists). Apply to record a historic statutory disposition A ‘statutory disposition’ happens when registered common land or green, or a registered right of common, has been affected by a statutory scheme (such as a compulsory purchase order) which causes either the extinguishment of the common land or town or village green and rights of common over it or the transfer from that land to replacement land of the rights of common, so that it instead becomes the common or town or village green and the rights of common can be exercised over it. Before you apply you should make sure that the relevant instrument has come into effect insofar as it affects registered land or rights of common. For example, where a compulsory purchase order provides for the vesting of land given in exchange, the vesting takes effect on a specified date which is later than the date on which the compulsory purchase order itself is confirmed. It is only after this later date that application can be made to the registration authority to deregister the taken land, and to register the replacement land. In such a case, you should make sure that the vesting provided for in the order has indeed taken place, as in certain circumstances, the vesting may not occur until many years after the date of confirmation of the order. If you are applying to deregister land in exchange for replacement land, you should include in your application details of the replacement land given in exchange. Who can apply Anyone can apply to record a historic statutory disposition. Interpretation The enactments listed would result in a statutory disposition. Some have been repealed and replaced previous enactments to similar effect, but these may also be registered. the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act 1845, sections 99 and 107, or the Compulsory Purchase Act 1965, section 21 and Schedule 4, which authorise the taking of common land and green (compulsorily if required) for particular purposes, where one or other statute is incorporated in another ‘special’ Act for that purpose. The acquisition of common land under the 1845 Act is generally subject to the approval of the Secretary of State under section 22 of the Commons Act 1899. Inclosure Act 1845, sections 147 and 149, which enable the exchange of land, or of a recreational allotment remote from a village for another more convenient, by order of the Secretary of State. Inclosure Act 1846, section 11, which enables the exchange of stinted rights of common between two commons, by order of the Secretary of State. Malvern Hills Act 1930, section 8, which confers on the Malvern Hills Conservators a power to sell, lease, exchange or dispose of land regulated as part of the Malvern Hills, subject to the consent of the Secretary of State, and section 9, which confers powers on the Conservators to sell or exchange land regulated as part of the Malvern Hills for the purpose of adjusting, defining or improving their boundaries, subject to the consent of the Secretary of State. a conveyance of registered land made for the purpose of sections 13 and 15 of the New Parishes Measure 1943, which enables the Diocesan Board of Finance for the diocese in which the land is situated to acquire land for various purposes connected with the Church of England. Greater London Parks and Open Spaces Order 1967, articles 7, 8 and 12, which enable the erection of buildings or permanent inclosure of common land or green; article 15, which confers on London borough councils powers to exchange parts of common land or green for land adjoining; and article 17, which confers on such councils powers to use portions of common land for street improvements. the Countryside Act 1968, sections 6 and 9 and Schedule 2, which confer powers exercisable by local authorities over common land open to public access, in the interests of persons resorting to that land for open-air recreation. the Acquisition of Land Act 1981, section 19: a compulsory purchase order in respect of any land forming part of a common other than where the Secretary of State issues a certificate under section 19(1)(aa). the Acquisition of Land Act 1981, paragraph 6 of Schedule 3: a compulsory purchase order in respect of any common land other than where the Secretary of State is satisfied that paragraph 6(1)(a) or (aa) applies and certifies accordingly. See notes above. New Towns Act 1981, paragraph 13 of Schedule 4, which enables the compulsory purchase of registered common land or of a registered town or village green. Town and Country Planning Act 1990, section 229 enables the appropriation of land forming part of a common or of a town or village green by a local authority. the Acquisition of Land (Authorisation Procedure) Act 1946, paragraph 11 of the First Schedule (which was re-enacted in section 19 of the Acquisition of Land Act 1981), and the Town and Country Planning Act 1971, section 121 (which was re-enacted in section 229 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990). Planning Act 2008, section 131 or 132, which enables the compulsory purchase of common land or of a town or village green, or of a right of common, in an order granting development consent. Apply to record a historic severance of a right of common You can apply to register the severance of a right of common which occurred between 2 January 1970 and before 28 June 2005. Severance is the act of separating a right of common from the dominant tenement (such as a farmhouse) to which it was attached, so that the right of common could be transferred on its own without the land it was attached to. Who can apply You can apply if you’re: the person to whom the right of common was transferred on severance the owner of the right of common at the date of application the owner of the dominant tenement to which the right is registered as being attached Interpretation From 28 June 2005 it has no longer been possible to sever rights of common (except in the limited circumstances described in section 9(2) of the Commons Act 2006). This was prohibited under section 9 of the Commons Act 2006, whether the severance is temporary (such as where the rights are let by the commoner to a third party) or permanent (such as where the rights are sold to one person and the dominant tenement is sold to another). Section 9 applies only to rights of common which are attached to land and could have been severed under the law as it stood before 28 June 2005. It does not apply to rights of common which cannot be severed, including ‘unquantified rights’, for example rights to take fuel or collect firewood, and ‘rights appendant’: in such cases, the common law continues to apply, and the rights may not be severed either temporarily or permanently. If your application is supported by good evidence of severance, such as a conveyance made before 28 June 2005 where the land to which the rights are registered as attached is conveyed to one party and the rights are conveyed in gross to another party, and the severance was lawful, that is likely to be sufficient to support an application to register the severance as a historic event. Unless the instrument or other contemporary evidence shows an intention that the rights should be severed from the land, the registration authority cannot grant your application. However a right of common may be treated as having been severed, even in the absence of contemporary written evidence, if your application shows that the right was subsequently treated as severed and there is no other explanation for that treatment."

Commons registers: apply to record new events Land management Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs You can apply to register new events dating from 1 October 2008 to the following local authorities: Blackburn with Darwen Council Cornwall Council Devon County Council (but not including Plymouth or Torbay) County of Herefordshire District Hertfordshire County Council Kent County Council (but not including Medway) Lancashire County Council (but not including Blackpool) You can apply to register new events dating from 15th December 2014 to the following local authorities: Cumbria County Council North Yorkshire County Council Events that happened before the dates specified above are called historic events . You can’t apply if the land or right of common is not in any of these areas. The commons registers are held by commons registration authorities. These are the top-tier local authority for an area (such as a county council or a metropolitan borough). Find more information about applying to change the commons registers to help you with your application. The common land where a right of common can be used is called the ‘servient tenement’. The right of common belongs to a separate piece of land, which is called the ‘dominant tenement’ (for example a farmhouse). The owner or occupier of the dominant tenement can use the right of common on the servient tenement. Apply to create a new right of common You can apply to create a new right of common for: new land (which will then be registered as common land) land that is already registered as common land If you apply to create a new right of common to graze animals, the registration authority has to consult Natural England before making a decision about whether the land can sustain those grazing animals alongside any existing rights. However, the registration authority makes the final decision. It must reject your application if your application would add more animals than the common can sustain. Who can apply You can apply if you’re the owner of the: servient tenement dominant tenement Use form CA1 . You’ll be applying under Section 6. What you can’t apply for Under Section 6, you can’t create new rights of common: over an existing registered town or village green by reservation (for example for certain months or parts of the common only) or prescription (a long period of use that has been unchallenged by the landowner) ‘in gross’ (in other words, when the rights are given to a person under a deed rather than belonging to a dominant tenement) You can apply to register a right of common as a historic event if that right of common came into existence before the dates specified at the top of this guidance. Use form CA14 . You’ll be applying under Schedule 3. Apply to vary a right of common You can apply to vary an existing right of common so that: you can alter what the right entitles you to do you can use it on a piece of land that is added to the existing land you can use it on new land, instead of all or some of the land on which you could previously use it If the variation will create a new right of common to graze animals, the registration authority has to consult Natural England before making a decision about whether the land can sustain those grazing animals alongside any existing rights. However, the registration authority makes the final decision. It must reject your application if your application would add more animals than the common can sustain. Who can apply You can apply if you’re: the owner of any part of the existing common the owner of any land that will become a new part of the common the owner of the dominant tenement the registered owner of a right in gross Use form CA2 . You’ll be applying under Section 7. Where you’re applying to vary part of a right of common, but not all of it, you must also apply at the same time to apportion the right (see guidance above on applying to apportion a right). What you can’t apply for You can’t apply to vary a right of common so that the right can be used on land that is already registered as a town or village green. You can usually only apply to vary a right to reduce the area of land over which a right of common can be used, if you provide replacement land. However, you may be able to do that by applying to surrender (give up) a right of common under Section 13 using form CA7 . You can’t apply for a change in the dominant tenement under Section 7. You can use form CA5 instead but only if part of the dominant tenement is being used for non-agricultural purposes. Apply to apportion rights of common You can apply to divide a right of common. This is called ‘apportionment’, and it happens when a dominant tenement is divided into 2 or more lots that are separately owned. The right is divided into the same proportions as the split in the dominant tenement. For example, if the right of common is to graze 100 sheep and the dominant tenement is divided into two lots on a 70/30 basis, the first lot’s right will be to graze 70 sheep and the second lot’s will be to graze 30 sheep. You can apply to apportion a right of common if you own a part, but not all, of the dominant tenement. By doing so, you’re effectively claiming your share of the total right of common. Where you own part, but not all, of the dominant tenement, you must apply to register an apportionment of rights if they are to be: surrendered (given up) varied (changed) reallocated (where part of the dominant tenement is used for non-agricultural purposes) severed (split away from the dominant tenement) extinguished or transferred to new land due to a statutory disposition (for example a compulsory purchase order) These will each require their own application, which is called the ‘primary application’. In these cases, you must apply to the registration authority to register the apportionment at the same time as you make the primary application. You can apply to register apportionment on your own or together with the other owner(s). If you apply on your own, the register will be only be changed to show the changes that relate to you. The entry relating to the other owner(s) won’t change. Who can apply You can apply if you’re the person making a primary application. If more than one person was involved in your primary application then all must apply to register the apportionment too. But if there is no primary application involved then you apply if you own any part of the dominant tenement, or you can apply jointly with the other owners of the dominant tenement. Use form CA3 . You’ll be applying under Section 8. Your share of the right of common will be the same as your share of the dominant tenement. You can use MAGIC to measure the approximate area of a defined parcel of land. You can only apply to apportion a right of common if it is quantified (in other words, it is measured in numbers) and attached to land. For example, if you have a third of the dominant tenement, you will have a third of the rights. However, if your right is to graze animals, you can only graze whole numbers of animals. So if dividing the rights gives you 12.75 animals, you can actually only graze 12 animals. What you can’t apply for You can’t apply to apportion a right that is unquantified (in other words, it’s not measured in numbers and it’s therefore unlimited). For example: a right to cut peat or turf (called ‘turbary’) an unquantified right to take wood (called ‘estovers’) unquantified fishing rights (called ‘piscary’) Apply to attach a right of common to land You can apply to have a right of common that is currently held in gross attached to land (which would turn that land into a dominant tenement). The result is that the right becomes usable by the occupier of the dominant tenement. Who can apply You can apply if you’re the registered owner of the right of common held in gross and you either occupy the dominant land to which the right will be attached, or the occupier of that land consents to your application. Use form CA4 . You’ll be applying under Section 10. Apply to reallocate an attached right of common You can apply under Section 11 to alter a right of common where part of the dominant tenement is developed for non-agricultural uses (called the ‘relevant part’), so that the right of common is attached to the reduced area of the dominant tenement which remains in agricultural use. This is called reallocation. Land is considered in agricultural use if it is used for the following purposes: growing crops pasture or grazing forestry keeping land as woodland or scrubland any activity that receives a payment under the EC (Single or) Basic Payment Scheme For example the relevant part can be taken out of agricultural use through a compulsory purchase order to develop the land or where it has planning permission for a change of use to a non-agricultural use. In the case of a compulsory purchase order, you must apply after the order has been confirmed but before the ownership of the relevant land is transferred to the new landowner (which will be specified in the order). If you’re not sure when the relevant part will be transferred ask your legal adviser or the compulsory purchase authority . Who can apply You can apply if you’re the owner of the dominant tenement (including the relevant part). Use form CA5 .You’ll be applying under Section 11. Where you’re applying to reallocate part of a right of common, but not all of it, you must also apply at the same time to apportion the right (see guidance above on applying to apportion a right). Apply to transfer rights in gross You can apply to transfer a right of common held in gross (under a deed) to someone else. The person that the right is transferred to is called ‘the transferree’. Who can apply You can apply if you’re either: the registered owner of the right of common held in gross the transferee, and you have the written permission of the registered owner Use form CA6 . You’ll be applying under Section 12. Apply to surrender or extinguish a right of common You can apply to surrender (make a deed to give it up) a right of common or have it extinguished (cancelled by law). The right is surrendered or extinguished when it has been removed from the commons registers. Who can apply You can apply if you own: the dominant tenement a right of common held in gross any part of the servient tenement Use form CA7 . You’ll be applying under Section 13. Where you’re applying to surrender or extinguish part of a right of common, but not all of it, you must also apply at the same time to apportion the right. Apply to register a statutory disposition A ‘statutory disposition’ is a legal instrument which either extinguishes rights of common and the common itself or transfers them to new land which is given in exchange for the land being taken away (for example a compulsory purchase order). There are 16 different types of legal instruments which do this. The instruments are listed in column 1 of the Table in paragraph 8 of Schedule 4 to the Commons Registration (England) Regulations 2014, but for ease of reference they are listed here: the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act 1845, sections 99 and 107, or the Compulsory Purchase Act 1965, section 21 and Schedule 4, which authorise the taking of common land and green (compulsorily if required) for particular purposes, where one or other statute is incorporated in another ‘special’ Act for that purpose. The acquisition of common land under the 1845 Act is generally subject to the approval of the Secretary of State under section 22 of the Commons Act 1899 Inclosure Act 1845, sections 147 and 149, which enable the exchange of land, or of a recreational allotment remote from a village, for another more convenient, by order of the Secretary of State Inclosure Act 1846, section 11, which enables the exchange of stinted rights of common between two commons, by order of the Secretary of State Malvern Hills Act 1930, section 8, which confers on the Malvern Hills Conservators a power to sell, lease, exchange or dispose of land regulated as part of the Malvern Hills, subject to the consent of the Secretary of State, and section 9, which confers powers on the Conservators to sell or exchange land regulated as part of the Malvern Hills for the purpose of adjusting, defining or improving their boundaries, subject to the consent of the Secretary of State a conveyance of registered land made for the purpose of sections 13 and 15 of the New Parishes Measure 1943, which enables the Diocesan Board of Finance for the diocese in which the land is situated to acquire land for various purposes connected with the Church of England Greater London Parks and Open Spaces Order 1967, articles 7, 8 and 12, which enable the erection of buildings or permanent inclosure of common land or green; article 15, which confers on London borough councils powers to exchange parts of common land or green for land adjoining; and article 17, which confers on such councils powers to use portions of common land for street improvements. the Countryside Act 1968, sections 6 and 9 and Schedule 2, which confer powers exercisable by local authorities over common land open to public access, in the interests of persons resorting to that land for open-air recreation The Acquisition of Land Act 1981, section 19: a compulsory purchase order in respect of any land forming part of a common other than where the Secretary of State issues a certificate under section 19(1)(aa) the Acquisition of Land Act 1981, paragraph 6 of Schedule 3: a compulsory purchase order in respect of any common land other than where the Secretary of State is satisfied that paragraph 6(1)(a) or (aa) applies and certifies accordingly. See notes above. New Towns Act 1981, paragraph 13 of Schedule 4, which enables the compulsory purchase of registered common land or of a registered town or village green Town and Country Planning Act 1990, section 229 enables the appropriation of land forming part of a common or of a town or village green by a local authority Planning Act 2008, section 131 or 132, which enable the compulsory purchase of common land or town or village green, or of a right of common, in an order granting development consent Who can apply? This is generally the person making or applying for a relevant instrument or who will benefit from it – but see column 4 of the Table in paragraph 8 of Schedule 4 to the 2014 Regulations for a list of the possible applicants. There is a legal duty to register a statutory disposition. For example, a London Borough makes a deed to exchange some registered common land and transfer the common and the rights of common to another piece of land (so it can build housing on the old common) under article 15 of the Greater London Parks and Open Spaces Order 1967. It is that London Borough’s duty to register the statutory disposition. Please contact Defra for advice if you think that any statutory power (whether local or national) has been left out. Use form CA8 . You’ll be applying under Section 14. Where you’re applying to register a statutory disposition which would extinguish or transfer part of a right of common, but not all of it, you must also apply at the same time to apportion the right (see guidance above on applying to apportion a right). Apply to register a town or village green Before you apply, you will need to check whether the recreational use of the land by local people meets the strict test for registration. This includes establishing whether use of the land has been ‘as of right’ (in other words, without permission, without force and without secrecy) rather than ‘by right’ (in other words, because the local authority is legally obliged to make that land available). Your application must show that a significant number of local people have used the green for lawful sports and pastimes as of right for at least 20 years. It will help your case if you’re able to find a range of witnesses who can provide detailed statements. You’re strongly advised to contact the commons registration authority before applying to register a new town or village green. Where your application is prevented by one of the trigger events set out in Schedule 1A to the 2006 Act (such as a notice of application for planning permission), you can’t apply to register land as a town or village green until that trigger event has been followed by a terminating event (such as the refusal of that application for planning permission). Your application must show that use of the land meets one of the following criteria: the land has been used for 20 years or more, and is currently in use, for sports and pastimes as of right the land was used for sports and pastimes as of right for 20 years or more, but that use stopped being as of right no more than 1 year before the date you apply You should check whether the landowner has submitted a ‘landowner statement’ in relation to the land. (The commons registration authority holds a register of landowner statements.) A landowner statement ends any period of recreational use of the land as of right. The effect of a landowner statement has 2 possible consequences. If the land has been used for: less than 20 years, then an application to register the land as a green will fail more than 20 years, then the 1-year period of grace starts and you can apply under Section 15(1) and rely on the criteria under Section 15(3) However, a landowner statement doesn’t prevent a new period of use restarting if recreation on the land continues. Who can apply? Anyone can apply to register land as a town or village green under Section 15(1) using form CA9 provided that the right to apply for registration has not been excluded . If you’re a landowner, apply under Section 15(8) using form CA9 to register your own land. Apply to sever a right of common You can apply to sever a right of common from the dominant tenement it is attached to. Severance can only happen in two ways: where either Natural England or a commons council apply to sever the right, or where the Secretary of State for Defra makes an order allowing the severance. The right is separated from the dominant tenement and becomes a right in gross which is transferred to either the applicant (public body) or the persons specified in the order. Severance by transfer to public bodies Rights can be severed by being transferred to Natural England, a commons council or an equivalent body that represents the interests of the commoners and is designated by order made by Defra (paragraph 1(5) of Schedule 1 to the Commons Act 2006). For example the Dartmoor Commons Council has been designated by order under the Dartmoor Commons (Authorised) Severance Order 2008. Who can apply? Only the public bodies mentioned above can apply. Use form CA11 . You’ll be applying under Schedule 1 paragraph 1(6)(b) to the Commons Act 2006. Where you’re applying to sever and transfer part of a right of common, but not all of it, you must also apply at the same time to apportion the right. Severance authorised by order You can apply if your name is specified in the order as the person to whom the severed right is to be transferred. Use form CA12 . You’ll be applying under Schedule 1 paragraph 3 to the Commons Act 2006, as read with Schedule 4, paragraph 13(1) to the 2014 Regulations. Apply to declare your entitlement to a right of common You can apply to record your name in the registers as the person who is eligible to exercise a right of common if that right is attached to a dominant tenement. Many entries in the commons and greens registers show who applied to register rights of common, but not who has the right today. Who can apply? Only the owner or tenant (if the tenancy is for more than 6 months) of a dominant tenement can apply. Use form CA15 . You’ll be applying under regulation 43 of the Commons Registration (England) Regulations 2014."
/guidance/town-and-village-greens-how-to-register,"Information and guidance on registering land as a town or village green. Town and village greens: how to register Recreation Land management Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Overview The Growth and Infrastructure Act 2013 has made a number of significant changes to the law on registering new town and village greens under the Commons Act 2006. Section 16 of the 2013 Act inserted new Section 15C and Schedule 1A into the 2006 Act, which exclude the right to apply for the registration of land in England as a town or village green where a trigger event has occurred in relation to the land. The right to apply for registration of the land as a green remains excluded unless and until a terminating event occurs in relation to the land. Trigger and terminating events are set out in Schedule 1A to the 2006 Act and broadly relate to whether land is identified for potential development in the planning system. The other changes were: the period of grace, where recreational use of the land as of right has ceased before an application was made, has been reduced to one year; sections 15A and 15B of the 2006 Act introduced ‘landowner statements’ and the registers for recording them. Landowner statements can prevent land being registered as a town or village green; and minor amendments to section 31(6) of the Highways Act 1980, which allows landowners to prevent the dedication of their land as highway, to align it with landowner statements. The relevant period for declarations was extended to 20 years. A single application form (CA16) allows for highways statements and declarations, and landowner statements. We have published the application form CA16 . Guidance to Commons Registration Authorities in England on Sections 15A to 15C of the Commons Act 2006 has also been published. Applying to register land as a town or village green Town and village greens developed under customary law as areas of land where local people indulged in lawful sports and pastimes. These might include organised or ad-hoc games, picnics, fetes and similar activities. Most greens were registered in the late 1960s under the Commons Registration Act 1965. Provided the right to apply has not been excluded (see overview above), anyone can apply under section 15(1) of the Commons Act 2006 to register land as a green if it has been used by local people for lawful sports and pastimes ‘as of right’ (ie without permission, force or secrecy) for at least 20 years. Please see below for guidance on applications - but note that different rules apply in following pioneer areas: Devon (but not including unitary authorities) Kent (but not including unitary authorities) Cornwall Hertfordshire Herefordshire Lancashire (but not Blackpool), and Blackburn with Darwen Cumbria North Yorkshire If your application relates to land in one of these areas, you should go to the guidance in the Pioneer areas section. Please see our [InlineAttachment:6] on the registration of new town or village greens Application form 44: Application for the registration of land as a town or village green Guidance on completing an application to register land as a town or village green (outside the pioneer areas) The Commons (Registration of Town or Village Greens) (Interim Arrangements) (England) Regulations 2007 Guidance on voluntary registration of land as a town or village green There is an alternative means of protecting land through the planning system. The new Local Green Space designation empowers local communities to protect green spaces of local importance without the need to meet strict statutory criteria. Sites may be designated for a variety of reasons, including their setting, nature conservation benefits, or their quietness. Local communities will be able to identify green spaces through their local and neighbourhood plans, which will then receive protection equivalent to Green Belt, ruling out new development other than in very special circumstances. Consideration within the local planning process will ensure that the new designation will complement and not undermine investment in homes, jobs and other essential services. Pioneer areas In relation to the pioneers areas for Part 1 of the Commons Act 2006 (see the list above under Applying to register land as a town or village green) the procedures, forms and guidance for applications under section 15 have been revised, and are now contained in the Guidance to Applicants in the pilot implementation areas - you should not use any other guidance or forms for applications in the pilot implementation areas. Management and protection of registered town and village greens Defra published [InlineAttachment:7] which answers some of the questions which we most frequently get asked in relation to the management and protection of town and village greens. Study of town and village greens registration system In March 2009 Defra commissioned the Countryside and Community Research Institute to undertake a research study  to examine the land type and use of a sample of sites claimed in recent applications to register new greens, as well as whether those sites were earmarked for development and, where applicable, the reasons for the failure of the applications. Registration of new greens: 2013 survey In late 2013 Defra undertook a repeat survey of commons registration authorities in England to establish the level of activity relating to new greens applications. Responses were received from 29% of authorities. The data is considered to be reasonably representative of all authorities in England and the results have been scaled-up to estimate the activity throughout England. Town and village green research project - 2006 The final report , of a research project by ADAS UK Ltd to improve the practical evidence base on town and village greens. Database of registered town or village greens A database of registered town or village greens in England is available. The data was gathered by the University of Aberystwyth in connection with, but not as part of, the biological survey of common land. The data was gathered in the late 1980s, and is not kept up-to-date. Adverse possession on town or village greens See the guidance note on adverse possession for more information.

/guidance/commons-registration-authorities-maintain-registers-of-commons-and-greens,"How to find out which sort of commons registrations authority you are and how you must maintain your registers.  Commons registration authorities: maintain registers of commons and greens Land management Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs The content on this page is in beta and may be updated frequently. This guide is part of a collection which will replace guidance for commons registration authorities and the Planning Inspectorate . Common land is owned by 1 or more people and used by other people, who are called commoners. Commoners have rights to use the land to graze their sheep, for example. Town and village greens are open spaces that local people can use for sports and pastimes. The registers record the location and area of common land and town and village greens. They also record the rights of common. They aren’t always accurate and therefore need to be corrected. Commons registration authorities The following are the commons registration authorities for common land and town and village greens in England: county councils unitary councils district councils where there’s no unitary council London borough councils The following aren’t commons registration authorities, so they don’t have registers: the Court of Common Council of the City of London the Council of the Isles of Scilly Pioneer registration authorities You’re a pioneer registration authority if you’re 1 of the following councils: Blackburn with Darwen Borough Council Cornwall Council Devon County Council (but not including Plymouth or Torbay) County of Herefordshire District Council Hertfordshire County Council Kent County Council (but not including Medway) Lancashire County Council (but not including Blackpool) 2014 registration authorities You’re a 2014 registration authority if you’re 1 of the following councils: Cumbria County Council North Yorkshire County Council 1965 registration authorities All other registration authorities are called 1965 commons registration authorities. Maintain registers If you’re a pioneer or a 2014 authority, you must keep your commons register and your register of towns and village greens up to date under Part 1 of the Commons Act 2006 by: recording new events recording historic events correcting mistakes If you’re a 1965 commons registration authority, you can only accept applications to correct the following types of mistake: mistakes in the register made by a registration authority - read Section 19(2)(a) buildings wrongly registered as common land or a town or village green other land wrongly registered as common land or a town or village green You can continue to process applications made under the Commons Registration Act 1965. Land in 2 or more authorities’ areas If you share a common or a green with another registration authority, you can agree between you that only 1 of you’ll be responsible for the registration of that land. This is called a straddling agreement. If you had one in place before 1 April 1974, it expired on that date, so you’ll need to renew it. Agency agreements You can agree with another registration authority to transfer some or all of your registration duties. Outstanding registrations You must check your registers for any registrations that are still outstanding under the Commons Registration Act 1965, section 6 and section 7. You must write ‘final’ or ‘void’ on any entries that remain to be recorded as such on the register as the duty under the 1965 Act has been saved. Exempted land You can’t record land in the New Forest, Epping Forest or the Forest of Dean in the registers. The following commons were exempted under the Commons Registration Act 1965, but you can register them under the 2006 Act: Amersham: Austenwood Common, Coleshill Common, Gold Hill Common, Hyde Heath, Ley Hill Common Brentwood: Shenfield Common Bromley: West Wickham Common, Spring Park Coventry: Greyfriars Green, Hearsall Common, Keresley Common, Stoke Commons, Top Green, Whitley Common Croydon: Coulsdon Common, Farthing Down Common, Kenley Common, Riddlesdown Common Egham: Thorpe Green Esher: Brook Hill Common, Downside Common, Leigh Hill Common, Little Heath Common, Old Common, Oxshott Heath, Upper and Lower Tilt Commons Hampshire: Otterbourne Hill Common Harrogate: The Stray Merton: Mitcham Common Portland: Victoria Gardens Slough: Cippenham Village Green Common Southampton: West End Road Recreation Ground Watford: Cassiobridge Common Whitley Bay: The Links Common York: Micklegate Stray Email commons.villagegreens@defra.gsi.gov.uk for advice about land that you can’t accept applications for. Registers of common land and town and village greens You must have separate registers for common land and town and village greens. Each register must have: a general part individual register units for each registration of land and the rights usable over it a register map supplemental maps which show the land that rights are attached to, such as a farm The general part You must include arrangements that apply to the whole register in the general part such as agency agreements, straddling agreements and exempted land (read Form 1) . The individual register units Each register unit has 2 parts: the land section, which records the land that the right can be used on the rights section, which records the details of the right of common In the land section, record the common or green, with its map reference (read Form 2) . The ownership section shows who claimed to own the common or green when it was registered. It may not be accurate unless: a Commons Commissioner found that the land had no owner and so ordered it to be registered as council owned (vested) a Commons Commissioner decided that a council owned the land You can only change an entry in the ownership section: to correct a mistake made by the commons registration authority in the original registration - follow model entry 23 to delete an entry if the Land Registry informs you (with a B52 form) that the land’s ownership has been recorded in the register of title - follow model entry 24 The ownership section is being phased out and will eventually be abolished as it is being replaced by the Land Registry’s register of title. The register map You can use 1 or more map sheets for the register map. You can show 1 or several register units on 1 sheet. You must number the sheets and bind them if you have several sheets. You can add overlays, insets or new maps or sheets to the register, but you must keep all existing maps. You must use Ordnance Survey sheets at a scale of at least 1:10,560 for moorland . For all other land you must use Ordnance Survey sheets at a scale of at least 1:2,500. You can also add or delete notes about things that affect public access, such as a common or green’s management or regulation. If you’re a 1965 authority, you can add notes with details of private and charitable rights and interests in the land. You can’t make such notes if you’re a pioneer or a 2014 registration authority. In the rights section, record the rights of common that can be used over the land in the land section (read Form 3) . Rights of commons are usually attached to land (not the common), called the dominant tenement - this could be a farm. The owners or occupiers of the dominant tenement can use the right of common (eg grazing their sheep on the common). You must record the address of the dominant tenement in column 5 of the register, including a reference to a supplemental map. If the dominant tenement has a house on it, you can record it by its postal address and Ordnance Survey grid reference. Add a supplemental map to a new or corrected entry. You can use the applicant’s map if it’s good enough, or create your own if it isn’t. The existing references for dominant tenements may be in the form of parcel numbers on an Ordnance Survey map. These are valid, but you must correct them when you change any part of an entry. If the right of common is held in gross (held by a person instead of attached to land), record the name and address of the owner in column 5. Supplemental maps Supplemental maps show the dominant tenement. If you change an existing entry made under the 1965 Act that doesn’t currently have a supplemental map, you must add one. You can use an applicant’s map or prepare your own. The scale must be at least 1:10,560. You can show 1 or more dominant tenements on a supplemental map. Each dominant tenement must be clearly cross-referenced to the relevant entry in the rights section. You must keep the supplemental maps together as part of the register, rather than keeping them in the application files. Add information to the registers You can add information to an entry (such as a post code) to make it easier to understand. Allow access to the registers You must allow members of the public to inspect and make copies of: the commons register the register of town and village greens any records that relate to an application to change the registers You must also provide official copies of the registers or records held in connection with the registers, such as a copy of an original application. You must certify them as true copies. You can’t charge for inspections but you can charge for official copies. The charge must be the same as or less than it costs you. Deregistration This guidance doesn’t cover deregistration of common land or town and village greens under section 16 and 17 of the 2006 Act , which only the Planning Inspectorate deals with. Further information This guidance relates to Part 1 of the Commons Act 2006 and The Commons Registration (England) Regulations 2014 . The Association of Commons Registration Authorities supports commons registration officers and staff whose work includes common land and town and village greens."
/guidance/commons-registrations-authorities-applications-and-proposals,"How to deal with applications and proposals, amend your registers of common land and town and village greens, and set fees.  Commons registrations authorities: applications and proposals Land management Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs The content on this page is in beta and may be updated frequently. This guide is part of a collection which will replace guidance for commons registration authorities and the Planning Inspectorate . Individual members of the public, or groups such as an association or a limited company, can make applications to change the registers of common land and of town and village greens. Make sure you treat any application by a group as having been made by that group, rather than the person who signed the form. A proposal is an application that a commons registration authority makes to itself. Both applications and proposals can be made to: record new events (including rights, commons or town or village greens) record a historic event correct a mistake in the register As a commons registration authority, you can make decisions about applications and proposals through full council or a committee of the council, or you can delegate decisions to an appropriate officer. You can send letters by email as long as applicants have agreed to receive them in that way. Anyone can communicate with you by email without asking you first. Applications can’t be submitted by email. How to process applications Make sure the application has been made on the correct form , and the fee, information and any maps requested by the form have been included and are at the correct scale. Make sure that the evidence applicants provide is convincing enough to be considered further. Also make sure the application form has been signed by each of the applicants. You can ask applicants for any missing items. If they don’t provide them, return the application and the fee. You don’t have to process an application that’s incomplete. Forms CA1, CA2, CA6, CA7 and CA13 have two parts, Parts A and B. Check the applicant has either filled in Part A or provided a deed of grant (a legal document that transfers a property or right from one person to another). Once the application is complete, give it a unique reference number and stamp it with the date you received it or on which it was complete. Fees You should set fees to match your costs for processing applications. You must publish your fees on your website. The first time you publish your fees they take effect immediately. But if you change your fees, you must give 14 days’ notice before they take effect. There are some types of application that you can’t charge for . You should tell applicants that they will have to pay extra fees to the Planning Inspectorate if you refer their application and it’s one of the types of application that you can charge for. Check ownership of the land You may need to make sure that an application is made or agreed to by the owner(s) of that land. In such cases, you’ll need to be satisfied that you have enough evidence of ownership as requested in each application. You can’t accept an application from a tenant or a lessee (except applications to register declarations to rights of common). When you’re required to check the ownership of the land in an application, you should check that there’s enough evidence. If the land hasn’t been registered with the Land Registry, the applicant must supply a copy of conveyances showing the land and the buyer going back at least 15 years. Acknowledge receipt of applications Write to applicants to acknowledge their application and send them: a unique reference number for the application a copy of the notice published on your website the postal and email addresses for queries Ask them for any other information or documents you need to process the application and tell them the date they must provide them by. Publish notices As soon as you’re satisfied that the application is complete, publish a notice about it on your website. This must include: the names of the applicant and the commons registration authority the name and location of the land full details of the application a full explanation of the effects of the application the address where members of the public can look at the application and any other relevant documents the postal and email addresses for comments and objections, with the information that these will not be treated as confidential the deadline for comments and objections, which must be at least 42 days later than the date of the notice the section of the Commons Act 2006 that’s relevant to the application You must keep a list of people and organisations that ask to be told about any applications or proposals relating to commons or town and village greens. Email a copy of the notice to all of them. You must also email a copy of the notice to all those listed in Schedule 7 of the regulations under the relevant type of application. If the application is to add or remove land from the registers, you must put up a site notice for at least 42 days. Place the notice at the entrance to the land or an obvious place on the boundary. You don’t have to replace the site notice if someone removes or damages it. For applications to add or remove land, you must also inform every other local authority within the area, including: parish councils the chair of parish meetings National Park authorities You don’t have to contact the landowner if it’s not possible to do so. Land or rights that belong to the Church of England If you get an application that relates to land or rights that belong to the church, you must communicate with the rector, vicar or priest in charge of that particular piece of land. But if the post is empty, you must write to the area’s Diocesan Board of Finance instead. Comments and objections Anyone can make comments and objections about an application in writing, within the deadline. They must sign it and state: their name and address their interest in the application (eg as the landowner or a local resident) the reason for their comments and objections Send copies of any comments and objections that you receive by the deadline to the applicant. Give them at least 21 days to reply in writing. If there are 2 or more applicants, check all of them have signed the reply. As a commons registration authority you can also submit comments and objections, usually if you have an interest in the application. Site visits You can conduct a site visit of land affected by an application. But if you appoint an inspector to hold a public inquiry, they must inspect the land unless the landowner or occupant refuses to allow them onto the land. If so, it may be possible to inspect the land from a road or public path next to the land. The inspector must ask the applicant whether they want to be present at the site visit or send a representative instead. The inspector must give them reasonable notice of the time and date of the site visit. But they don’t need to postpone the site visit if the applicant or their representative doesn’t turn up. You can visit unclaimed land without permission. Unclaimed land is both of the following: it doesn’t have an entry in the Land Registry you haven’t been able to find the owner in any other way Decide whether to refer the application to the Planning Inspectorate You must refer the following types of application and proposal to the Planning Inspectorate if you have an interest in the outcome to the extent that if you made the decision it would be seen as being biased (eg if your authority owns the land and wants to develop it). You can’t refer any other types of applications even if you have an interest in the outcome. You must also refer these types of application and proposal to the Planning Inspectorate if someone with a proprietary legal interest in the land (such as an owner or tenant) has objected to it: correct a mistake by adding or removing land from the register, or correct a mistake in the quantity of rights register waste land of the manor not registered as common land - waste land of the manor is land that is open, uncultivated and unoccupied, and that did or does belong to a manor reregister a town or village green wrongly registered as common land remove buildings wrongly registered as common land or as a town or village green remove other land wrongly registered as common land or as a town or village green If the application or proposal relates to part of a right of common and is accompanied by an application for an apportionment (new event or historic event), you must also refer the apportionment. The primary application must be registered before the apportionment can be decided. If the primary application fails then so must the apportionment. See advice on what types of amendment are primary applications . Process an application or proposal that you decide to refer to the Planning Inspectorate in the usual way. After the period has passed for comments and objections and any views on those from the applicant, you should send the following to the Planning Inspectorate: the application or proposal all supporting documents other relevant documents that you have, such as extracts from the registers all comments and objections that you’ve received Send everything to the following address: Common Land Casework The Planning Inspectorate Rm3/25B Hawk Wing Temple Quay House 2 The Square Bristol BS1 6PN The Planning Inspectorate will ask you to complete a referral letter, to confirm details such as the reason for referral. If the Planning Inspectorate thinks that the criteria for referral don’t apply, it will return the application or proposal to you and you will need to continue processing the application or proposal. Before making a decision, the Planning Inspectorate may decide to hold any of the following, which you can ask to be part of: a site visit a hearing, when applicants can speak to the decision-maker an inquiry Once the Planning Inspectorate has made a decision, it will: tell you the result publish the decision on its website send you details of everyone who made comments and objections You must: inform the applicant and anyone who made comments or objections about the decision publish the decision and the reasons for it on your website Hearings and inquiries If you’re thinking of refusing an application, you must give the applicant an opportunity to make their case to you before finalising your decision. You must also allow anyone else to make their case to you if their civil rights would be affected by your decision. They can do this by talking to you in person or on the phone. This applies whether you grant the application or refuse it. You can appoint an independent inspector (such as a barrister) to hold a public inquiry. If you decide to hold an inquiry into applications and proposals (eg if they are likely to generate controversy) then you must appoint an inspector to oversee the inquiry. If an application or proposal has been referred to the Planning Inspectorate, it can decide to hold a formal hearing or a public inquiry and must appoint an inspector to lead the hearing or public inquiry. You should publish the date and time of hearings and inquiries on your website at least 6 weeks in advance. Inform the applicant and anyone who made a comment or objection (including anyone the registration authority invited to do so). The inspector can issue directions for public inquiries or hold a pre-inquiry meeting. Requests to withdraw or make changes to applications Applicants don’t have an automatic right to withdraw applications. If an applicant asks to do so, you must decide whether or not it’s reasonable. You should usually allow the withdrawal of applications that need to be made by a specific person (eg the landowner) if they don’t want to proceed with it. But be cautious about allowing an application made in the public interest to be withdrawn. Treat requests to make changes to applications in the same way. But if a suggested change to an application would be so significant that you would have to publish a new notice, you can refuse the change. Make your decision Once you have all the information you need and all parties have had a fair chance to make their views known, you must make a decision based on the contents of the application or proposal and any extra information provided or found through comments and objections and site visits, for example. It’s up to the applicant to prove that the application satisfies all of the criteria. If any evidence is missing, or nobody has opposed an application, you must not assume that the applicant has met all the criteria. You must refuse an application if the applicant cannot supply all the required evidence. You must also take the following into account: whether the application would have an effect on the public interest your duty to conserve biodiversity your duty to conserve and enhance sites of special scientific interest ( SSSI ) and areas of outstanding natural beauty the Habitats Directive your duty to prioritise the needs of a National Park If the application relates to a SSSI , you must tell Natural England . Give it 28 days to reply before you decide to give your consent to any activities that will or could damage the site’s features of special interest. You must also consider any views provided by Natural England for applications to create or vary new grazing rights. You can grant an application in part if, for example, the criteria is met for part (but not all) of the land affected by the application or proposal. Amend your register Once you or the Planning Inspectorate have granted an application or a proposal, you must correct the register using the model entries as a guide . If you make an amendment that isn’t a deletion, you must transfer the information on the whole sheet to a new form. You should follow the standard entries as closely as possible for: new or replaced register maps supplemental maps rights shown on supplemental maps You must stamp any new register form or map sheet. The stamp must have the following information: COMMONS ACT 2006 the name of your registration authority COMMONS REGISTRATION AUTHORITY the date If the Secretary of State agrees to an application for deregistration and exchange of land, the Planning Inspectorate will send you an order to amend the register. Repeated applications You don’t have to accept repeated applications unless there’s new evidence or material to consider. Applicants can make a repeat application for a case that was refused under the 1965 Act, if the criteria under the 2006 Act would lead to a different outcome. In some cases the criteria under the 2006 Act are different to those under the 1965 Act. Publish your decision Tell the applicant and anyone who made comments or objections the result of the application and the reason for your decision. Publish this information on your website. Make proposals Pioneer and 2014 authorities can make proposals for the following types of amendment: to correct the register under Section 19 to bring the register up to date to register historic events during the transitional period But you should only make a proposal: if it’s in the public interest - you can’t make applications on behalf of the public if there would be an indirect impact on the public interest if you or your predecessors made a mistaken entry, and no one has a personal interest in correcting the register or the landowner can’t be found if you have a direct interest, eg if you own the land You must prepare a statement about why you’re making the proposal and the justification for it. You must provide the same information and evidence you would expect from an applicant. You must publicise your proposal by preparing a notice with the same contents required for applications. Send the notice to: owners of land connected with the proposal (if known) anyone who has registered a declaration to use a registered right of common over the land any owners of rights in gross (rights attached to people instead of land) unless there are so many that it would be impractical commons councils responsible for the land or other bodies representing the interests of rights holders over the land other local authorities in your area anyone who asks to receive email notices of applications and proposals anyone else you think would have an interest in the proposal If the proposal is to add or remove land from the registers, you must put up a site notice for at least 42 days. Put the notice at the entrance to the land or an obvious place on the boundary. You don’t have to replace the site notice if someone removes or damages it. You may need to refer your proposal to the Planning Inspectorate if your decision could be seen as being biased. Judicial review Applicants can’t appeal against your decision to grant or reject an application. But they can challenge it in the High Court through a judicial review. You can also challenge a decision with a judicial review. The High Court can order a register to be amended if an entry or any information in it was added in a fraudulent way (read section 19(7) of the 2006 Act). Further information This guidance relates to Part 1 of the Commons Act 2006 and The Commons Registration (England) Regulations 2014 . The Association of Commons Registration Authorities supports commons registration officers and staff whose work includes common land and town and village greens."
/guidance/commons-registration-authorities-process-new-event-applications,"How to register new rights and make changes to existing rights of common. Commons registration authorities: process new event applications Land management Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs The content on this page is in beta and may be updated frequently. This guide is part of a collection which will replace guidance for commons registration authorities and the Planning Inspectorate . Rights holders or members of the public need to amend existing information in, or add new information, to the register to record any new events. This is a new event. For changes to be classed as new events they must have happened on or after: 1 October 2008 if you’re a pioneer commons registration authority 15 December 2014 if you’re a 2014 commons registration authority Events that happened before these dates are called historic events . You’re a pioneer registration authority if you’re one of the following councils: Blackburn with Darwen Borough Council Cornwall Council Devon County Council (but not including Plymouth or Torbay) County of Herefordshire District Council Hertfordshire County Council Kent County Council (but not including Medway) Lancashire County Council (but not including Blackpool) You’re a 2014 registration authority if you’re one of the following councils: Cumbria County Council North Yorkshire County Council You can’t accept applications for land that: isn’t in pioneer or 2014 areas is in Epping Forest, the Forest of Dean or the New Forest Create a new right of common You can create new rights of common over an existing common, or over a new piece of land to create a new common. You can’t create new rights of common over a town or village green. The right of common must be attached to land. This land is then called the ‘dominant tenement’. It isn’t possible to register a right of common claimed by prescription (long use that wasn’t challenged by the landowner) as a new event, but it may be possible to do so as a historic event . If you receive an application to create a new right of common to graze animals, you must consult the local area office of Natural England . It will tell you whether it thinks that the land can sustain the grazing alongside other grazing on existing commons. You may also have to decide if any rights that commoners aren’t using at the moment may be used in the future. However, you must make the final decision, and reject the application if the extra grazing would be unsustainable. If you decide to allow extra grazing against Natural England’s advice you should explain why in your decision. You can also create a right of common as a historic event . Evidence you need You must have: application form CA1 evidence that the applicant owns the dominant tenement or the common consent from other owners, tenants or lessees of the dominant tenement and the common (except if any of these is the applicant) details of the right to be created either the details and a map of the common, or the common’s register unit (if the land is already registered), or both if only part of the common has been registered a map and the postal address, Ordnance Survey grid reference or Land Registry title number of the dominant tenement evidence that the land can sustain the new right and all existing rights, if the right is for grazing on an existing common If applicants want to create a new right of common over just part of an existing common, they must supply a map with their application form. Once you’ve made a decision , quote the Commons Act 2006, section 6 in the notice on your website. Amend the register Use model entry 3 as a reference if you’re registering a new right of common. Use model entry 18 as a reference if you’re registering new common land. Vary an existing right of common You can make the following variations (changes) to existing rights of common: add new land to an existing common - but the new land can’t be a registered green replace some or all of the existing common - again, the new land can’t be a registered green vary what the right can do - eg change the grazing animals from cattle to sheep You can only accept an application to reduce the area over which a right can be used if the applicant provides replacement land. This is so that the total area of land over which the right can be used isn’t reduced. You can’t accept applications for any of the following: extend what a right can do (eg increase the number of cattle from 50 to 75) deregister land and remove it from the commons register, unless the land is being replaced with new land - even if all rights of common are extinguished (cancelled) amend the dominant tenement (the land the right of common is attached to) You can only accept applications from the following: the current common’s owner the future common’s owner the dominant tenement’s owner the owner of the right in gross Evidence you need You must have: application form CA2 evidence that the applicant owns either the current or future common, the dominant tenement or the right in gross consent from the owner of the current or new common, or their tenants or lessees, the owner of the dominant tenement or right in gross, if they’re not the applicant the register unit numbers the entries in the rights section details of the change (and a map, if applicable) a map and postal address, Ordnance Survey grid reference or Land Registry title number of the dominant tenement, unless the right is held in gross if the right is for grazing, evidence that the land can sustain the varied right alongside any existing rights if the variation applies to only part of a right of common, an application to apportion the rights (because the right must be apportioned before you can vary that part of the right) If you receive an application to vary a grazing right, you must consult the local area office of Natural England . It will tell you whether it thinks that the land can sustain the varied grazing alongside any other grazing on existing commons. You may also have to decide if any rights that commoners are not using at the moment may be used in the future. However, you must make the final decision, and reject the application if the extra grazing would be unsustainable. If you decide to allow extra grazing against Natural England’s advice you should explain why in your decision. Once you’ve made a decision , quote the Commons Act 2006, section 7 in the notice on your website. Amend the register Use model entry 4 as a reference to amend the register. Use model entry 17 to add new land. If the rights are being apportioned, you must register the apportionment before you register the variation. Apportionment of rights of common Rights of common are apportioned (divided) when the dominant tenement (the land the right of common is attached to) is divided into 2 or more shares. The rights of commons must be apportioned pro rata, which means in proportion to the share of the dominant tenement. For example, a right of common to graze 100 sheep is attached to a dominant tenement of 40 hectares. The owner sells 5 hectares. The purchaser’s share of the right would be calculated as: total number of rights (100) divided by the total area of the dominant tenement (40) multiplied by their share of the dominant tenement (5). This would give the purchaser a right to graze 12.5 sheep on the common. You must round down fractional rights - in this example to 12 sheep. Fractional rights are only extinguished (cancelled) if and when the apportionment is registered - see section 13(3) of the Commons 2006 Act. Rights can’t be apportioned if they’re only attached to a dwelling (rather than a larger area of land that includes a dwelling, which is acceptable) or the right is unquantified (it isn’t measured by weight, size or number). The following unquantified rights can’t be apportioned: estover - the right to take specific products, such as timber, firewood or bracken piscary - the right to take fish turbary - the right to take turf or peat If an unquantified right is for the benefit of the whole of the dominant tenement, rather than attached only to a building, you may allow an apportionment if it would not increase the overall burden on the common. For example, a right to take bracken for cattle bedding may imply a right to take enough bedding for all the cattle that may be kept on the dominant tenement over winter. If the dominant tenement is divided into 2 or more holdings, you may allow each of those holdings the same right, because in practice it would be limited by the number of cattle that can be kept on that holding over winter. Rights that are a result of an apportionment must be treated as if they were registered separately. This ensures that the owner of each share of the rights can do what they like with it without affecting the others who have a share in the right. If a right has been apportioned but hasn’t been registered, it’s possible for someone to make a declaration of entitlement to use their portion of the right without having to register the apportionment first. Applicants don’t need to register apportionments except when an apportionment must be registered before it’s possible to make certain types of other amendments to the register that only relate to part of a right – known as a ‘primary’ application. The primary application must be submitted at the same time as the application to register the apportionment. The primary applications are: variation reallocation surrender and extinguishment severance statutory dispositions You can accept applications from anyone who owns any part of the dominant tenement. An application may be made jointly but it isn’t necessary for all owners of the dominant tenement to apply. If there’s a primary application, the same person must apply for the apportionment. The common-law principle that allowed a right of common to be extinguished if the dominant tenement was developed and could no longer benefit from the right has been abolished. So rights attached to land remain attached to that land whatever it’s used for. You can apportion rights as a historic event but only if the apportionment is necessary to make another type of amendment to the register (the type of amendment covered by a primary application), such as variation or surrender of a right. Evidence you need To register an apportionment of rights, you must have: application form CA3 proof that the applicant is the same person (or people) who has made a primary application, if relevant evidence that the applicant owns the land the register unit numbers the rights section entries an Ordnance Survey map of the area of the dominant tenement owned by the applicant at the correct scale - at least 1:10,560 for moorland and 1:2,500 for other land; the map must show the current field boundaries supplemental maps showing the new dominant tenement to be created and its postal address, Ordnance Survey grid reference or Land Registry title number the applicant’s calculation of how the rights have been apportioned Once you’ve made a decision , quote the Commons Act 2006, section 8 in the notice on your website. Amend the register You must register the apportionment before you register other changes that result from a primary application. Each new dominant tenement needs a supplemental map. Several dominant tenements can be shown on 1 supplemental map. This applies even if the old dominant tenement (before it was apportioned) was referred to by OS parcel units or any other ways that didn’t involve a map. Use model entry 5 as a reference to amend the register. If the applicant doesn’t supply information about the residue (what’s left) of the old dominant tenement (before it was apportioned), repeat the current ownership details in column 3 of the rights section. Sever rights from land Rights can only be permanently severed (separated) from a dominant tenement (the land the rights of common are attached to) in 2 ways: Natural England or a commons council (or another body that represents the rights of commoners and is appointed by order) applies to have the rights transferred to them the Secretary of State for the Environment makes an order for the right to be transferred to a body or a person Before Natural England makes an application, it must give at least 2 months’ notice to the owner of the common that the right can be used on (unless they can’t find the owner’s name). It must also give notice to any commons council or designated body that represents the rights of commoners for that common. The notice must: specify the name and address of the owner of the dominant tenement describe the right to be transferred state the proposed reason for the transfer contain an extract of the relevant entry in the register that shows the details of the right, the rights section entry number, the details of the dominant tenement, the register unit number of the common and, if the right can be used over only part of that common, the details of that part of the common state if and to what extent the right has been used during the previous 5 years specify the date on which Natural England intends to make its application If a commons council or designated body that represents the rights of commoners is responsible for the common, it must consent to the transfer. Owners of dominant tenements can temporarily sever their rights of common from the dominant tenement to lease it for up to 2 years. If the application only relates to part of the right, there must be an accompanying application to apportion the rights. You must register the apportionment before the right can be severed. Evidence you need To register the severance of rights you must have: application form CA11 consent from the owner of the dominant tenement, and if appropriate, either the commons council or the designated body representing commoners the register unit numbers the entries in the rights section a map of the dominant tenement, and its postal address, Ordnance Survey grid reference or Land Registry title number evidence that notice was given to the owner of the common, and any commons council or designated body representing commoners if Natural England is the applicant Once you’ve made a decision , quote the Commons Act 2006, section 9 in the notice on your website. Amend the register Use model entry 14 as a reference to amend the register. The severance is only legal after it has been registered. Attach rights of common in gross to land Owners of rights of common in gross (rights that are deeds owned by people rather than a right attached to land) can apply to attach them to a piece of land, which creates a dominant tenement. The owner of that land becomes the person entitled to use the right. The applicant must get permission from anyone entitled to occupy the land that they want to attach the right to. You must reject the application if the occupiers refuse consent. Evidence you need To register the attachment of rights of common in gross you must have: application form CA4 the register unit numbers the rights section entries a map and the postal address, Ordnance Survey grid reference or Land Registry title number of the dominant tenement evidence of consent from the land’s occupier (if different from the applicant) evidence that the applicant owns the rights in gross Once you’ve made a decision , quote the Commons Act 2006, section 10 in the notice on your website. Amend the register Using model entry 6 as a reference to amend the register. Reallocate rights of common Landowners can apply to reallocate their rights of common if part of the dominant tenement (the land the rights are attached to) stops being used for agricultural purposes. All the rights become attached to the part that continues to be used for agriculture. For example, if they sell off a quarter of the dominant tenement for housing, all the rights become concentrated in the three-quarters still used for farming. The part of the dominant tenement used for housing would be removed from the register. Agricultural purposes are: growing crops pasture or grazing forestry keeping land as woodland or scrubland an activity that qualifies for a payment under the Basic Payment Scheme If reallocation happens because of a compulsory purchase order, the owner must apply after the compulsory purchase order is confirmed but before the land is actually sold. If the application only relates to part of the right, there must be accompanying application to apportion the rights. You must register the apportionment before the right can be reallocated. Evidence you need To register the reallocation of rights of common you need: application form CA5 the register unit numbers the rights section entries a map and the postal address, Ordnance Survey grid reference or Land Registry title number of the dominant tenement the details and a map of the part to be sold (the ‘relevant part’) consent from any tenant, mortgage lender or owner of a leasehold evidence that the applicant is the landowner evidence that the land will be used for non-agricultural purposes (eg a copy of planning permission or the confirmed compulsory purchase order with evidence that the relevant part hasn’t yet been sold) Once you’ve made a decision , quote the Commons Act 2006, section 11 in the notice on your website. Amend the register Use model entry 7 as a reference to amend the register. The change in the area of the dominant tenement will only be shown on the supplemental map. Transfer rights in gross Rights of common held in gross are rights held by deed by 1 or more people rather than being attached to land. You can register the transfer of rights in gross to a new owner. You can only accept applications from: registered owners of rights in gross the person to whom the rights in gross are to be transferred If the current owner isn’t the registered owner, the current owner must apply to record a historic event (to transfer the right) or apply to transfer the right with the registered owner’s permission. This is because the registered owner remains the legal owner of the rights. Evidence you need To transfer rights in gross you need: application form CA6 consent from the registered owner of the right (if they’re not the applicant) the register unit numbers the rights section entries Once you’ve made a decision , quote the Commons Act 2006, section 12 in the notice on your website. Amend the register Use model entry 8 as a reference to amend the register. Surrender and extinguish rights Rights of common can be extinguished (cancelled) by being surrendered (given up) by their owners. Only the following people can apply: owners of the dominant tenement (the land the rights of common are attached to) owners of rights in gross owners of all or part of the common on which the rights can be used You can’t extinguish rights through these previously acceptable methods: the common and the rights used over it are owned by the same person (unity of ownership or seisin) the owner is shown to have permanently stopped using the rights (abandonment) when part of a common is enclosed, eg by a garden, and commoners don’t object (implied release) the common is destroyed (eg by being covered by the sea) or the product (eg peat) has run out there is a change in the dominant tenement that means that it can’t benefit from the rights - eg the right is attached to a house that is demolished and isn’t replaced, or the whole dominant tenement is converted into a reservoir You can register rights that were extinguished before 1 October 2008 in the pioneer areas and 15 December 2014 in the 2014 authorities areas as historic events . If the application only relates to part of the right, there must be accompanying application to apportion the rights. You must register the apportionment first so that you only extinguish the relevant proportion of the rights. Evidence you need To surrender and extinguish rights you need: application form CA7 evidence of ownership of the dominant tenement, the right held in gross or any part of the common the register entry for the common the register entry for the right the postal address, Ordnance Survey grid reference or Land Registry title number of the dominant tenement, and a map (unless it’s a right in gross) If the applicant is the owner of all or part of the common, check that they have also included the consent of: the owner of the dominant tenement or the rights in gross a tenant a mortgage lender or the owner of a leasehold Once you’ve made a decision , quote the Commons Act 2006, section 13 in the notice on your website. Amend the register Use model entry 9 as a reference to amend the register. Statutory disposition Common land, town or village greens and rights of common can be bought and transferred to alternative land or removed from the register. This happens most often when a compulsory purchase order is made to buy land, eg for new housing. The legal instrument that causes the transfer or removal of the common is called a statutory disposition. There are many different types of statutory disposition. Statutory dispositions can: extinguish rights of common extinguish rights of access for open-air recreation extinguish rights to recreate on greens give new rights of common or recreation to the people whose rights were removed stop land being classed as common land or a green create new common land or a green The person or organisation that makes the statutory disposition or benefits from it must apply to amend the register to record the statutory disposition, including the registration of any replacement land. Changes are only legal once they’re registered, so you should process the application as soon as you can. For example a compulsory purchase order doesn’t extinguish a right of common until the extinguishment has been registered. Statutory dispositions normally come into effect after the date on which they’re confirmed. You’ll need to check its terms to find the date on which it has or will come into effect, as you can only register land or rights after that date. If the application only relates to part of the right, there must be accompanying application to apportion the rights. You must register the apportionment first so that the statutory disposition applies the relevant proportion of the rights. Evidence you need To remove or add land or rights you need: application form CA8 a copy of the statutory disposition (they’re listed in the Regulations, Schedule 4, paragraph 8, table, Column 3 - Relevant instrument - if it’s not on that list it isn’t eligible) evidence that the applicant is one of the people listed in the Regulations, Schedule 4, paragraph 8, table, Column 4 - applicant a copy of any approvals, authorisations, certificates or consents that have been given for the statutory disposition evidence that the disposition has come into effect the register unit the register entry to be changed (if applicable) the details of the change to be made to the register Once you’ve made a decision , quote the Commons Act 2006, section 14 in the notice on your website. Contact Defra if you know of any other legislation that has been wrongly left out of the table of statutory dispositions in paragraph 8 of Schedule 4 to the Regulations. Amend the register Use model entries 3, 4, 9, 13 (for exchanges of land), 15, 16, 17, 18 or 20 (for exchanges of land) as a reference to amend the register. Declaration of entitlement to use rights of common In many cases the rights section records the person who originally applied to register the rights rather than the person now entitled to use the rights. You can accept an application from the owner of the dominant tenement (the land the rights of common are attached to) or a tenant if their tenancy is for more than 6 months. You can cancel a declaration if it’s wrong or the person recorded in the declaration is no longer entitled to the right (eg the owner sold the dominant tenement or died). Before cancelling a declaration you must write to the person who made the declaration and take into account any replies made within 28 days. You may receive applications that relate to only part of a right (eg 15 sheep when the register says 45). This can happen when the ownership of dominant tenement has been divided into more 2 or more shares (known as an apportionment). Someone who owns part of a dominant tenement can make a declaration in relation to their share of the right, even if no apportionment has been made. If this happens the application must show how the applicant calculated their share of the right, which must be pro rata. You must check that their calculation is correct. You may receive applications from people who wrongly attempt to apportion their rights by making a declaration. Apportionments happen when the dominant tenement changes from having 1 owner to having 2 or more owners. Declarations only confirm who is currently entitled to use the right of common. You should allow an applicant who wrongly submits a declaration to withdraw their application and submit an apportionment instead. Evidence you need To register a declaration, you need: application form CA15 the register unit number the rights entry number evidence of ownership of the dominant tenement or entitlement to occupy it - a copy of the title, a list of previous deeds or conveyances, or a copy of the lease agreement the number of rights the applicant is entitled to - either all the rights in the register or part of the rights Amend the register Use model entry 10 as a reference to record the declaration of a whole right. Use model entry 11 as a reference to record the declaration that relates to part of a right. Send a copy of the updated register to the applicant. If the declaration relates to part of a right, you can cancel that entry using model entry 12 as a reference to amend the register. If you cancel a whole right, draw a line through the entry in column 6 of the rights section of the register. Register new greens Anyone can apply to register a town or village green. Before you can consider an application, you must establish whether the right to apply has been excluded by a trigger event that has occurred in relation to the land. The exclusion remains until a corresponding terminating event occurs. Check that the applicant has stated either of the following: that the land has been used ‘as of right’ for sports and pastimes for 20 or more years at the time of the application, and is still in use when the application is made that such use ended no more than 1 year before the date of application The applicant must prove, on the balance of probabilities, that the land should be registered. Check your register of landowner statements for any that relate to the land that the applicant wants to register as a green. A landowner statement ends any period of recreational use as of right . This has 2 possible consequences. If the land has been used for: less than 20 years, the users wouldn’t have enough years of use to get the land registered so you have to refuse the application more than 20 years, the users have 1 year from the date of the landowner statement to apply to register the green A landowner statement doesn’t prevent the start of a new period of use if recreation on the land continues (it simply restarts the clock from zero). Landowner applicants Landowners can register their land as a town or village green. None of the tests apply, so they only have to supply: evidence of their ownership of the land written permission from any mortgage lenders and any leaseholders of the land (but only if their leases were granted for more than 7 years) Evidence you need Check that applicants have filled in application form CA9 Check that applicants have supplied a map of the land to be registered as a green. If the whole area is currently a common, they could tell you the register unit number rather than provide a map. Check that applicants have identified the locality, or the neighbourhood within a locality, in which the recreational users live (landowner applicants can do this, but don’t need to). Applicants can name the administrative or geographical area (such as an electoral ward or parish), or provide a map. Once you have this information, put up a site notice at or near an entrance to the land. On the application form, you also need to check that all of the following criteria have been met: a significant number of the inhabitants of any locality, or any neighbourhood within a locality, have taken part as of right in sports and pastimes on the land for a period of at least 20 years the date the use ended, if relevant any times the use was interrupted when the green was closed any planning permission affecting the land The law and regulations dealing with the creation of new town and village greens has been supplemented by case law, which you must use when making your decisions. Defra ’s assessment of the relevant case law follows. Significant number ‘Significant number’ doesn’t have to mean a large number of people (McAlpine Homes case, High Court). The question is whether the number of local inhabitants who use the land, relative to the number who live in the relevant locality or neighbourhood, is enough to mean that it’s generally used by the local community (rather than being used occasionally by a few people). The majority of the users don’t have to live in the locality or neighbourhood of the proposed green. As long as a significant number of them have used the land, it doesn’t matter that many or even most users come from elsewhere (Warneford Meadow case, High Court). The inhabitants of any locality, or of any neighbourhood within a locality A locality is a legally recognised administrative area, such as a civil parish, an ecclesiastical parish, an electoral ward or a conservation area. You must decide the relevant locality (or neighbourhood within a locality) after looking at all the evidence (Laing Homes case, High Court). If an application is amended to introduce a new locality or neighbourhood, the applicant and any objectors should have an opportunity to comment on it and gather more evidence to respond to it. Whether ‘a locality’ can mean more than 1 locality ‘Locality’ means just 1 locality rather than multiples (Trap Grounds case, Lord Hoffmann; Edwards v Jenkins; Paddico, Justice Vos). Meaning of ‘neighbourhood’ The concept of a neighbourhood is more flexible than that of a locality. Neighbourhoods don’t need to have legally recognised boundaries (Trap Grounds case, Lord Hoffmann), but you must be satisfied that an alleged neighbourhood is connected enough. A neighbourhood must have a meaningful description and must have ‘pre-existing’ connectedness (Warneford Meadow case). A housing estate could be a ‘neighbourhood’, even if it doesn’t have any community facilities, but a suggested boundary line that cuts across gardens, streets and an open space isn’t likely to be acceptable as a neighbourhood. You should approach the question of connectedness using the ordinary English meaning of ‘neighbourhood’ (Leeds Group plc v Leeds City Council, High Court). The introduction of the word ‘neighbourhood’ as an alternative to ‘locality’ was clearly to prevent applications failing on technicalities (Trap Grounds case, Lord Hoffman). Whether a neighbourhood must be within a single locality A neighbourhood can be in 1 or more localities (Trap Grounds case, Lord Hoffmann; Leeds Group case, Court of Appeal, Lady Justice Arden). The words ‘within a locality’ emphasise that a neighbourhood can be smaller than a locality and doesn’t have to have recognised administrative boundaries. Whether there may be more than 1 neighbourhood within a locality A locality can have more than 1 neighbourhood. Meaning of ‘locality’ in the expression ‘any neighbourhood within a locality’ The High Court rejected an argument that a ‘locality’ can’t be too big to have served a broad spread of its inhabitants. This was in the context of considering whether 2 neighbourhoods were ‘within a locality’. It was also agreed that an area that’s no longer a legally distinct administrative district after the 1937 local government reorganisation can still count as a ‘locality’ for the purposes of a ‘neighbourhood’ within it. Inhabitants who gain the right to lawful sports and pastimes After a green is registered, the inhabitants of the locality or neighbourhood gain the right to lawful sports and pastimes on the land (Lord Hoffmann, Trap Grounds case; Warneford Meadow case). If the inhabitants come from more than 1 neighbourhood (or locality), the rights apply to all the inhabitants of those neighbourhoods. . Landowners applying to register their land as a green can nominate the locality or neighbourhood that has the right to sports and pastimes on that green. Distribution within 1 or more localities You don’t need to consider the distribution of the inhabitants within the locality or localities (Paddico case, Justice Vos). Lawful sports and pastimes You should interpret the expression ‘lawful sports and pastimes’ in a common-sense way (Sunningwell case). ‘Lawful sports and pastimes’ don’t have to be organised sports or communal activities. Solitary and informal activities such as dog walking and children playing will qualify. There’s also no need for local inhabitants to have taken part in a range of sports and pastimes. An annual bonfire would be too sporadic to be considered as continuous use for lawful sports and pastimes (Redcar case, Lord Walker). Lawfulness of sports and pastimes ‘Lawful’ means that the sports and pastimes must not cause injury or damage to the owner’s property (Redcar case, Supreme Court, Lord Hope). ‘Lawful’ also excludes activities that are criminal offences, whether or not damage is caused. ‘Lawful’ excludes civil offences, even though use ‘ as of right ’ is a form of trespass (Warneford Meadow case). Trespass that is intended to intimidate, obstruct or disrupt a lawful activity on the land is the criminal offence of aggravated trespass, and therefore might fail to qualify as lawful use. As of right Use of the land must be ‘as of right’ throughout the relevant period. ‘As of right’ is described as being nec vi (not by force), nec clam (openly), and nec precario (without the owner’s permission). It’s irrelevant whether the users believe that they’re entitled to do what they’re doing, or know that they’re not. The law of prescription (long-term trespass that wasn’t challenged by the landowner) requires that the use relied on must be ‘of such a character, degree and frequency as to indicate an assertion by the claimant of a continuous right, and of a right of the measure of the right claimed’. Use that is ‘trivial and sporadic’ will not be enough. Openly Landowners must be able to see that the land is being used and resist that use if they want to. The following types of use don’t qualify: in darkness in dense vegetation use that only takes place when the users know that the owner is away - but use that happens when the owner is away would qualify if it’s just part of the pattern of use Without physical force, verbal challenges or notices Users must not break or cut through any barriers such as fences, walls, gates or hedges to get on to the land. However, if the landowner doesn’t repair a gap, there will come a point when entry through that gap won’t count as being forced entry and a new 20-year period of use as of right would start. Landowners can end a period of use through continuous and unmistakeable verbal challenges (Dalton v Angus, Justice Bowen; Newnham v Willison; Smith v Brudenell-Bruce; Cheltenham Builders case; Redcar case, Lord Rodger, Supreme Court). Landowners can also end use as of right by putting up suitably worded notices in obvious places. The following notices were considered to have been inadequate because they did not clearly forbid the use of the land (Redcar and Warneford Meadow cases): ‘Warning. It’s dangerous to trespass on the golf course’ ‘No public right of way’ By contrast the following notices are clear: ‘Private property. Keep out.’ ‘Do not trespass.’ ‘Private property. Access prohibited except with the express consent of [the landowner].’ You must consider whether users would have known that the landowner was objecting to and contesting their use of the land. You should find evidence of the actual responses by users. You and others should read notices in a common-sense and not a legalistic way. If it’s suggested that the owner should have done something more than put up the notice, you should consider whether anything more would have been proportionate to the user in question (Smith v Brudenell-Bruce, Justice Pumfrey). Landowners can’t claim that they couldn’t afford to put up notices as they need to do what’s necessary to tell people they object to their use (Warneford Meadow case). Fencing off the area or taking legal proceedings against users will not always be necessary as long as users know that the owner objects to their use of the land. It’s not necessary for a landowner to show that the use of his land was by force, it’s enough that he can show that the use was contentious, eg he tried to prevent it. Use of land becomes contentious when a landowner continually contests and interrupts use of their land in ways that are proportionate to the use of the land (Betterment Properties (Weymouth) Ltd v Dorset County Council and Taylor, High Court). A landowner’s objection to an application may have the effect of making continuing use of his land contentious but it would depend on: the circumstances in the case, including whether the applicants persist in the application whether landowners back up their objection with other actions to challenge use whether landowners communicate their objection widely to users There is an unresolved question when local inhabitants continue to use land in spite of notices telling users to keep out. A landowner who puts up a notice stating ‘Private land - keep out’ would be ‘in a less strong position if his notice is ignored by the public than a landowner who put up a notice permitting use (Beresford case, Lord Walker). On the other hand, Lord Rodger’s view in the Redcar case suggests that the notice would have a continuing effect. Without the landowner’s permission Landowners can state or imply their permission if they want to end use as of right. An example of state permission is the following notice, ‘The public have permission to enter this land on foot for recreation, but this permission may be withdrawn at any time’. Examples of implied permission include occasionally closing the land, or charging people for admission. Permission cannot be implied from a landowner’s inaction. Acts encouraging use, such as the landowner putting out picnic tables, would not prevent any informal use of that land from qualifying for registration. If the ‘as of right’ test is satisfied, there’s no need to consult the landowner any further (Redcar case, Supreme Court). Equality of rights If the land is used by the landowner and the local inhabitants but neither use interferes with the other, then the land can be registered as a green. For example, in one court case it was decided that the taking of a single hay crop from a meadow was a low-level agricultural activity that was compatible with recreational use for the late summer until the following spring. Similar considerations would apply to other types of use by the landowner. However, land can be registered as a green even when the landowners’ and users’ rights aren’t equal. For example, land was registered as a green despite the ‘overwhelming’ deference by local inhabitants to it being used as a private golf course. Rights of way You must separate use that is part of asserting a right to sports and pastimes over all the land, and use that suggests the assertion of a right of way. The rights of way don’t need to have been formally established or even claimed. You should also check whether paths have been added to a map of rights of way. A right of way might be a defined track used as a shortcut or as the shortest route linking 2 roads - it should be one that appears to be used as a right of way rather than for green-type use. Even if the journey is recreational (eg, to reach a viewpoint), it suggests the exercise of a public right of way (Trap Grounds case). A circular walk around a field (Laing Homes case) or a lake (Dyfed County Council v Secretary of State for Wales) may become a public footpath, but if walkers leave the path for other recreational activities, the way they use the track as well as the land may count as lawful sports and pastimes. There is a distinction between ‘pure walking’ (which is right of way type use) and use of the route as a mere ‘incident of’ or ‘ancillary to’ activities such as sunbathing, swimming, fishing and picnicking (which is green-type use). Use by (existing statutory) right Land use cannot be ‘as of right’ if the users have a statutory or other legal right to use the land (Barkas, House of Lords). Examples include Law of Property Act 1925, section 193; CROW Act, section 2; Open Spaces Act 1906, section 10; Public Health Act 1875, section 164; land held under a charitable trust for public recreation. On the land Traditional character of land There is no legal requirement for land to consist of grass or conform to a traditional image of a town or village green. Any land, even land covered by water, can qualify for registration if it has been used in the right way for the right period. Inaccessibility of land You can still register inaccessible areas on a proposed green as part of a green if they might form part of the scenic attraction or provide recreational opportunities (Trap Grounds case, Justice Lightman), eg: a pond could be used for feeding ducks or sailing model boats overgrown areas might provide a habitat for wildlife and benefits for bird watchers and others interested in nature Approach the question in a common sense way. It’s unnecessary for users to have set foot on every part or even the majority of the land (Lord Hoffmann, House of Lords). Buildings on land You can’t register any area that has been unavailable for sports and pastimes for part or all of the relevant period. Examples include: buildings (such as an electrical substation) an area that has been fenced off or walled off In other cases, you’ll have to judge whether an inaccessible or unused area should be regarded as part of the whole green. For a period of at least 20 years It’s enough that the local inhabitants, rather than particular individuals, have used the land for the full 20 years. You’ll have to look at an application more carefully when any of the relevant circumstances have changed during the 20 years, such as: the ownership of the land the condition of the land how the land has been used by the owner the character of the neighbourhood If any of the relevant circumstances have changed, it may mean that the land hasn’t been used for recreation for the full 20 years. Whether all use must take place only after 30 January 2001 The words ‘the inhabitants of any locality, or of any neighbourhood within a locality’ took effect on 30 January 2001 (CROW Act 2000, Section 98). But an application can include use before 2001 to qualify for the 20-year period. Statutory closure Don’t include any periods of statutory closure of the land when you’re considering whether the land has been used for 20 years. Statutory closure is access to the land being temporarily forbidden by a local authority or the government. For example, if the land was closed for 6 months during the foot-and-mouth outbreak, applicants will need to show that land has been used over a period of 20 years and 6 months. Permission granted after 20 years’ use If a landowner gives their permission to use the land after there has already been 20 years’ use, you must ignore this. The applicants can say in their application that use continues to be as of right at the date of the application. This only applies to a permission that was granted on or after 6 April 2007.

/guidance/commons-registration-authorities-correct-mistakes,"Correct mistakes in commons registers, including adding or removing buildings or land, and registering greens wrongly recorded as commons. Commons registration authorities: correct mistakes Land management Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs The content on this page is in beta and may be updated frequently. This guide is part of a collection which will replace guidance for commons registration authorities and the Planning Inspectorate . All this guidance applies to pioneer authorities and 2014 authorities . The only part of this guidance that applies to 1965 authorities relates to applications to make Section 19 corrections to the registers and to remove buildings or other land. You may find the following types of mistakes in your commons registers: boundary lines of commons or greens drawn in the wrong place by the registration authority commons or greens that should have been registered but weren’t greens that were wrongly registered as common land As part of your duty to review your registers , you should search the [InlineAttachment:1] for commons and greens made under Part 1 of the Commons Act 1899 or schemes of regulation for commons and greens made under the Metropolitan Commons Acts 1866 to 1898. Also check that your registers match the areas of common land and greens defined in any current: statutory schemes of management set up by your authority orders of regulation regulating public use of specific commons local or personal Acts of Parliament If you find any mistakes, you could make a proposal to amend the register provided there is a public interest in the matter. If you receive any objections to an application or a proposal from anyone with a legal interest in the land (such as an owner, rights holder, occupier or mortgage lender), you must refer the application to the Planning Inspectorate . You must also refer applications and proposals if you have an interest in the outcome to the extent that it could make your decision seem biased (eg if your authority owns the land and plans to develop it so doesn’t want it registered). Register statutory common land or greens Only pioneer and 2014 commons registration authorities can accept applications and make proposals to register the following: as common land - land recognised by law as common land that wasn’t finally registered (meaning that the provisional registration was confirmed) under the Commons Registration Act 1965 as a green - land that had been, and still was on 31 July 1970, allotted to local people for recreation but wasn’t finally registered under the Commons Act 1965 Any land in an application or a proposal under the Commons Act 2006, Schedule 2, paragraphs 2 or 3 must still be legally recognised as a common or a green by the relevant piece of law - the legislation that created that particular common or green can’t have been revoked. If you register a piece of land under Schedule 2, paragraphs 2 or 3 it won’t create new rights of common . But if it’s land that’s added to an existing common that has rights over it, then the rights can be used over the new part of the common. You can’t accept applications or make proposals for land covered by a building or within its curtilage (the land that ‘belongs’ to a building) unless the owner agrees. The meaning of ‘curtilage’ isn’t clearly defined. In recent judgments, common ownership seems to be less important than current use - for example, a basement area, driveway, passageway, garden and yard. A whole common or green is unlikely to be the curtilage of a building, but if a house has a physical enclosure around it (eg a wall or a fence), then the whole area within that enclosure (except the house) could be considered to be curtilage. The deadlines for applications and proposals are: 31 December 2020 for pioneer authorities 15 March 2027 for 2014 authorities You must put up a notice with details of the application or proposal at or near an obvious entrance to the site. Evidence you need To register common land or greens that should previously have been registered you need: application form CA13 an Ordnance Survey map of the land at the correct scale - at least 1:10,560 for moorland and 1:2,500 for other land evidence that the law which identified the land as common land or allotted it for recreation is still in force evidence of consent from the owner if any of the land is covered by a building or the curtilage of a building Once you’ve made a decision , in the notice on your website quote: the Commons Act 2006, Schedule 2, paragraph 2 for land recognised by law as common land that wasn’t finally registered under the Commons Registration Act 1965 the Commons Act 2006, Schedule 2, paragraph 3 for land that was still allotted to local people for recreation on 31 July 1970 Amend the register Use model entry 17 as a reference if you’re registering an extension to an existing common or green. Use model entry 18 as a reference if you’re registering a new common or green. Register waste land of a manor as common land Only pioneer and 2014 commons registration authorities can accept an application or make a proposal to register waste land as common land. Waste land of a manor is land that fulfils all of the following: the land was at any point, or still is, part of a manor the land is open, uncultivated and unoccupied at the date of the application or proposal the land hasn’t been registered as common land or a green But land is only eligible to be registered as waste land if it had been provisionally registered as common land under the Commons Registration Act 1965 but it was cancelled for any of the following reasons: the Commons Commissioner dismissed it because the land was no longer part of a manor the Commons Commissioner dismissed it because the land wasn’t subject to rights of common, but the Commissioner didn’t consider whether the land was waste land of a manor the applicant withdrew or agreed to withdraw the application, whether or not it was referred to a Commons Commissioner Check that waste land is open, uncultivated and unoccupied Waste land is legally defined as land that’s open, uncultivated and unoccupied. What is open land Open land means land with no physical barriers that prevent access to that land. Fencing that sets the boundaries of ownership can be open land, especially if the land can still be accessed on foot. You’ll need to check what barriers are for and whether they’re temporary or permanent. Ignore fencing on adjacent land, even if the common is completely surrounded by it - fencing is only relevant on land that’s part of the application. What is unoccupied land Whether land is occupied or unoccupied will depend on whether the land is used by the occupant, and if it is, how much. Unoccupied land means that nobody is physically using the land in a way that prevents other people from using it. The High Court has commented that while a golf course had rights over a piece of land, the rights did not amount to occupation (see R v Doncaster Metropolitan Borough Council). Land won’t automatically be considered occupied because it’s subject to a tenancy, lease or licence whose sole purpose is to allow grazing on the land. Land may be considered as occupied if it’s been physically improved by tenants, eg cultivating and reseeding moorland only for the tenants’ use and benefit. What is uncultivated land Whether land is cultivated or uncultivated land depends on what the land’s used for and how much it’s used. For example, intensive arable cultivation would count as cultivated land but grass cutting would not. Contact Natural England to check if the land is subject to an agri-environment scheme agreement. Check the terms of the agreement - schemes may require cultivation of the land either by physical or chemical means, eg ploughing, harrowing, fertilisers. You can use the following to check if land was part of a manor: A2A (Access to Archives) British History online local records offices the National Archives . the Victoria County History You usually can’t prove for certain that land was part of a manor, but you should be able to show that land probably was or still is part of a manor. If you register waste land of a manor it won’t create new rights of common, but if it’s land that’s added to an existing common with rights over it, then the existing rights can be used over the new part of the common. The deadlines for applications are: 31 December 2020 for pioneer authorities 15 March 2027 for 2014 authorities You must put up a notice with details of the application or proposal at or near an obvious entrance to the site. Evidence you need To reregister waste land of the manor you need: application form CA13 an Ordnance Survey map of the land at the correct scale - at least 1:10,560 for moorland and 1:2,500 for other land evidence of the provisional registration evidence that the land is still waste land of the manor at the time of the application evidence that the provisional registration was cancelled or withdrawn Once you’ve made a decision , quote the Commons Act 2006, Schedule 2, paragraph 4 in the notice on your website. Amend the register Use model entry 17 as a reference if you’re registering an extension to an existing common or green. Use model entry 18 as a reference if you’re registering a new common or green. Register a town or village green wrongly registered as common land Some greens were wrongly registered as common land because the land had rights of common over it, but greens can have rights of common over them. Only pioneer and 2014 commons registration authorities can accept applications or make proposals to transfer these to the register of town and village greens. The deadlines for applications are: 31 December 2020 for pioneer authorities 15 March 2027 for 2014 authorities You must put up a notice with details of the application or proposal at or near an obvious entrance to the site. Evidence you need To register town or village greens wrongly registered as common land you need: application form CA13 an Ordnance Survey map of the land at the correct scale - at least 1:10,560 for moorland and 1:2,500 for other land evidence of the provisional registration of the land as common land the circumstances in which the provisional registration became final (eg a Commons Commissioner’s decision ) evidence that the land was a town or village green immediately before it was provisionally registered as common land - this can be formal evidence, such as an inclosure award or order of exchange, or it could be by 20 years’ use as of right, or if it was in customary use as a green Once you’ve made a decision , quote the Commons Act 2006, Schedule 2, paragraph 5 in the notice on your website. Amend the register Use model entry 19 to amend the register. Remove the land and any rights of common from the commons register and record it as a new register unit in the greens register. Commoners will be able to use their rights on the green. Deregister buildings wrongly registered as common land or town or village green Pioneer authorities, 2014 authorities and 1965 authorities can deregister land that’s covered by a building or the curtilage of a building (the land that ‘belongs’ to a building) that was wrongly registered as common land or as a town or village green if all of the following apply: the land was provisionally registered as common land or green the land was covered by a building or belonged to a building on the date of the provisional registration the provisional registration became final the land has been at all times, and still is, covered by a building or belongs to a building - though it doesn’t have to be the same building or even a building that was legally built You can’t accept applications or make proposals for land covered by a building or within its curtilage unless the owner agrees. The meaning of ‘curtilage’ isn’t clearly defined. In recent judgments, common ownership seems to be less important than current use - for example, a basement area, driveway, passageway, garden and yard. A whole common or green is unlikely to be the curtilage of a building, but if a house has a physical enclosure around it (eg a wall or a fence), then the whole area within that enclosure (except the house) could be considered to be curtilage. The deadlines for applications and proposals are: 31 December 2020 for pioneer authorities 15 March 2027 for 1965 and 2014 authorities You must put up a notice with details of the application or proposal at or near an obvious entrance to the site. Evidence you need To deregister buildings you need: application form CA13 an Ordnance Survey map of the land at the correct scale - at least 1:10,560 for moorland and 1:2,500 for other land evidence of the provisional registration as common land or green the circumstances in which the provisional registration became final (eg a Commons Commissioner’s decision ) evidence that the land has been at all times and still is covered by a building or belongs to a building Once you’ve made a decision , in the notice on your website quote the Commons Act 2006, Schedule 2, paragraph 6) for a building wrongly registered as common land and paragraph 8 for a building wrongly registered as a town or village green. Amend the register Use model entries 15 or 16 to amend the register. Deregister other land wrongly registered as common land Pioneer authorities, 2014 authorities and 1965 authorities can deregister land wrongly registered as common land if all of the following apply: the land was provisionally registered as common land the provisional registration became final without being referred to a Commons Commissioner immediately before its provisional registration the land wasn’t subject to rights of common, or waste land of a manor, or a green (within the original meaning under the Commons Registration Act 1965), or land described in section 11 of the Inclosure Act 1845 The deadlines for applications and proposals are: 31 December 2020 for pioneer authorities 15 March 2027 for 2014 authorities Evidence you need To deregister other land wrongly registered as common land you need: application form CA13 an Ordnance Survey map of the land at the correct scale - at least 1:10,560 for moorland and 1:2,500 for other land evidence that the land was provisionally registered as common land evidence that the registration became final without being referred to a Commons Commissioner You also need evidence that before registration the land wasn’t any of the following following at the time of its provisional registration under the 1965 Act: subject to rights of common waste land of a manor a town or village green within the original meaning under the Commons Registration Act 1965 land described in section 11 of the Inclosure Act 1845 Once you’ve made a decision , quote the Commons Act 2006, Schedule 2, paragraph 7 in the notice on your website. Amend the register Use model entries 15 or 16 to amend the register. Deregister other land wrongly registered as a town or village green Pioneer authorities, 2014 authorities and 1965 authorities can deregister land wrongly registered as a town or village green if all of the following apply: it was provisionally registered as a town or village green the provisional registration wasn’t referred to a Commons Commisioner immediately before its provisional registration the land wasn’t common land or town or village green The deadlines for applications and proposals are: 31 December 2020 for pioneer authorities 15 March 2027 for 1965 and 2014 authorities Evidence you need To deregister other land wrongly registered as common land you need: application form CA13 an Ordnance Survey map of the land at the correct scale - at least 1:10,560 for moorland and 1:2,500 for other land evidence that the land was provisionally registered as a town or village green evidence that the provisional registration became final without being referred to a Commons Commissioner evidence that the provisional registration became final You also need evidence that immediately before provisional registration the land wasn’t: common land, meaning it wasn’t subject to rights of common or waste land of a manor a town or village green, meaning that during the 20 years before its provisional registration it was physically unusable for sports and pastimes (eg because of buildings, cultivation or fencing), or it hadn’t been allotted as a green under an enactment Once you’ve made a decision , quote the Commons Act 2006, Schedule 2, paragraph 9 in the notice on your website. Amend the register Use model entries 15 or 16 to amend the register. When costs are awarded If you refer an application under Schedule 2 to the Planning Inspectorate and they hold a public inquiry (but not a hearing), then the inspector responsible for the inquiry may award costs to the applicant or to an objector (who takes part in the inquiry) if: a claim is made for an award of costs applicants, any objectors or registration authorities taking part in the public inquiry behave unreasonably, causing significant expense that wouldn’t otherwise have been incurred Examples of unreasonable behaviour include: late introduction of evidence the adjournment (putting off ) or prolongment of an inquiry an applicant insisting on an inquiry and failing to present a reasonable case in support of the application The inspector will use the Department for Communities and Local Government’s Planning Practice Guidance on Appeals when deciding whether to award costs. Costs can’t be awarded for proposals. Section 19 corrections Section 19 allows for applications and proposals to correct certain types of mistake in the registers of common land and town and village greens. 1965 authorities 1965 authorities can only correct the registers if the registration authority made a mistake when it made or amended an entry in the register - for example, if a registration authority recorded the boundary of a common in a way that didn’t match the way it was shown in the application; read Section 19(2)(a). But if the authority recorded all the information in an application then it doesn’t qualify as a local authority’s mistake Pioneer and 2014 authorities Pioneer and 2014 authorities can make all of the following corrections: if the registration authority made a mistake when it made or amended an entry in the register - for example, if a registration authority recorded the boundary of a common in a way that didn’t match the way it was shown in the application - read Section 19(2)(a). But if the authority recorded all the information in an application then it doesn’t qualify as a local authority’s mistake to correct other mistakes provided they don’t affect the extent of land registered or what can be done by virtue of a right of common - for example, if the applicant wrongly defined the boundary of the land to which a right of common is attached, or stated that the right was only usable over part of the common when it was actually usable over the whole common - read Section 19(2)(b) to remove duplicate entries - these mistakes tended to happen when the landowner and the tenant made separate applications to record the same right of common - read Section 19(2)(c) to update the name and address of any person in an entry - this will usually relate to a change to either the name or address of the owner of a right of common in gross, for example through marriage or moving - read Section 19(2)(d). But it can’t be used to record a change in ownership of the right - applicants must use form CA6 instead if the boundary of a common or green is extended or reduced due to a natural change in the shape of a body of water - read Section 19(2)(e) Given the broad scope of Section 19 corrections, make sure you advertise applications to everyone with a potential interest in them. If the application would add or remove land, you must put up a site notice with details of the application or proposal at or near an obvious entrance to the site. There are no deadlines for these types of application. The deadline for proposals is 31 December 2020 for pioneers and 15 March 2027 for 2014 authorities. 1965 authorities can’t make proposals. The High Court may order an authority to amend either register if: any entry or any information relating to an entry was included due to fraud it would be fair to amend the register When you can’t make Section 19 corrections You can’t correct mistakes if it would be unfair to. For example, someone may have bought land thinking it wasn’t a common or a green because it wasn’t in the register. But the land turns out to be a common or a green that your registration authority left out of the register by mistake. You must balance the needs of those who own the land with those who want to correct the register. Evidence you need To make corrections you need: application form CA10 if relevant, an Ordnance Survey map of the land at the correct scale - at least 1:10,560 for moorland and 1:2,500 for other land a statement from the applicant to say which type of correction under Sections 19(2)(a) to (e) they want to make the mistake to be corrected details of the correction to be made You must refer an application or proposal to the Planning Inspectorate if it would add or remove land from the register or correct the numbers of rights in an entry and the application receives any objections from anyone with a legal interest in the land (such as owners, tenants, rights holders or mortgage lenders). You must also refer an application or a proposal to the Planning Inspectorate if your authority has an interest in the outcome to the extent that there would be no confidence in your authority’s ability to make an unbiased decision. Once you’ve made a decision , quote the relevant part of the Commons Act 2006, section 19 in the notice on your website. Amend the register Use this table to find the right model entry to use to amend the register.

/guidance/commons-registration-authorities-record-historic-events,"How to register historic rights of common and make changes to existing rights during the transitional period. Commons registration authorities: record historic events Land management Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs The content on this page is in beta and may be updated frequently. This guide is part of a collection which will replace guidance for commons registration authorities and the Planning Inspectorate . Historic events happened between: 3 January 1970 and 30 September 2008 (inclusive) in pioneer authorities 3 January 1970 and 15 December 2014 (inclusive) in 2014 authorities They should have been registered at the time but weren’t. The transitional period for 2014 authorities The aim of the transitional period is to correct the registers of commons and greens with historic events, free of charge and for a limited time. The transitional period for 2014 authorities is 15 December 2014 to 14 December 2018. The transition period has already closed for pioneer authorities . None of this guidance applies to 1965 authorities - the transitional period doesn’t apply to them, so they can’t record historic events. Review your registers You must review your registers of commons and greens to find any unrecorded events that should be recorded (eg a compulsory purchase of common land) or mistakes that should be corrected. You may find evidence of unregistered events and mistakes in your archives and old correspondence. You should also check these sources: local parish councils, for information about boundaries, wrongly registered land and non-registered land archives of other local authorities in your area (eg borough and parish councils) the National Archives local highways departments Highways England for information about road exchange schemes the Commons Commissioners’ decisions database the [InlineAttachment:1] - though any cases that predate the provisional registration of land under the 1965 Act will rarely be relevant You must complete your review of the registers by 14 December 2017. But you should complete it before then to give people time to apply and for you to be able to process applications or make proposals because you must decide all of them by 14 December 2018. If you find any unrecorded events or mistakes you should write to the person affected by it to encourage them to apply. Alternatively you could make a proposal. You may find that some mistakes qualify as corrections rather than as historic events when you check the application. Publicise the transitional period You should make sure that as many people as possible know that they have an opportunity to correct the registers free of charge for a limited time by: publishing a notice on your website emailing or writing to all local authorities in the area, including parish councils and the chair of any parish meeting emailing all local organisations that represent commoners contacting anyone else that you think should know about it Deciding applications You must make a decision on all applications and amend the register (if necessary) by the end of 14 December 2018. Make proposals You can make proposals up to 14 December 2017. But you should only do so if nobody else is prepared to apply and there is a public interest in amending the register to record an unregistered event or mistake (eg a road exchange scheme that took part of a common). Late applications and proposals for pioneer and 2014 authorities You can accept applications to register historic events after the transitional period has closed, but you must subject them to the fairness test. For the fairness test, check if someone has relied on the register as it is, and would be negatively affected if the register was amended. You must balance the interests of the applicant with those of other people who have an interest in the matter. For example Mr A buys a piece of land after the transitional period ends. Before doing so, he checked the register to establish whether the land was a common or green (it wasn’t). Mr B makes a late historic event application to claim right of common by 20 years use on Mr A’s land (which would turn Mr A’s land into a common). Because the right hadn’t been registered by the time Mr A checked the register the registration authority concludes it would be unfair to Mr A to register the right, so it refuses Mr B’s application. You can’t accept late applications for the surrender and extinguishment of a right of common. You can’t make late proposals. Fees for pioneer and 2014 authorities 2014 authorities can’t charge fees for applications up to and including 14 December 2017. They can charge fees for applications between 15 December 2017 and 14 December 2018, and for later applications. Pioneer authorities can charge for applications if the fees are published on their website. Historic creation of a right of common You can register rights of common created: between 3 January 1970 and 30 September 2008 in pioneer authorities between 3 January 1970 and 14 December 2014 in 2014 authorities The rights can have been created by any lawful means including by grant, by prescription (long use that wasn’t challenged by the landowner) or by lost modern grant. Applications can only be made by: the owners of any part of the land that would become the common the owners of any part of the land that the right would be attached to (the dominant tenement) the owners of the right if it isn’t attached to land (a right in gross) If you register a right of common to be used on unregistered land, it creates new common land. It’s only possible to register rights claimed by prescription on land that isn’t a common or green. Applicants may apply to register a right of common over registered land, if that right was granted by the landowner: after 3 January 1970 and before 1 October 2008 for pioneer authorities after 3 January 1970 and before 15 December 2014 for 2014 authorities For a common, you need to check whether it can sustain the use of the rights in the application as well as the existing rights. You must refuse the application if the common could not sustain those extra rights. If someone is applying for a right of common over a green, it’s likely that a new right of common would interfere with the local inhabitants’ right to use the green for sports and pastimes, so look into this type of application carefully. Evidence you need To register a historic right of common you need: application form CA14 evidence that the applicant owns the common, the dominant tenement or the right in gross the details of the right to be registered the details of the common over which the right can be used (including a map), or a register unit number if the land is an existing registered common the details of the dominant tenement that the right will be attached to (if relevant) evidence of how the right was created, including any deed or other legal instrument Once you’ve made a decision, quote The Commons Registration (England) Regulations 2014, Schedule 4, paragraph 15 in the notice on your website. Amend the register Use model entry 3 as a reference if you’re creating a right of common. Use model entry 18 as a reference if you’re registering new land. Historic variation to a right of common Variations (changes) to rights of common usually relate to what can be done under the right (eg varying a right to graze from 100 cattle to 600 sheep). Variations can also enable the right to be used over different land or adjust the dominant tenement (although this isn’t an apportionment). If a variation makes an existing right usable over unregistered land, that land must be registered as common land. A variation can’t lead to the deregistration of the whole common or green. You can register variations that happened after the date of the original registration of the right, but before: 1 October 2008 in pioneer authorities 15 December 2014 in 2014 authorities Applications can only be made by: the owners of any part of the common before the variation the owners of any part of the common after the date of the application the owners of the dominant tenement the owners of the right in gross (if they’re not the registered owners, they must first apply to transfer ownership) Evidence you need To register a historic variation of a right of common you need: application form CA14 evidence that the applicant owns any part of the common before the variation or at the date of the application, or the dominant tenement or right in gross the register unit number the entry number in the rights section of the register the details of the variation to be recorded the details of the dominant tenement (including a map) - unless the right is held in gross evidence of how the right was varied, if relevant Once you’ve made a decision, quote The Commons Registration (England) Regulations 2014, Schedule 4, paragraph 17 in the notice on your website. Amend the register Use model entry 4 as a reference if you’re varying what can be done under the right. Use model entry 17 if the variation requires new land to be registered. Historic apportionment of a right of common You can register the apportionment (division) of rights if the dominant tenement (the land that the right would be attached to) was divided before: 1 October 2008 in pioneer authorities 15 December 2014 in 2014 authorities Historic apportionments can only be registered when an application, called a ‘primary application’, is made at the same time to amend rights by: varying (changing) them severing (separating) them from the dominant tenement surrendering them (giving them up) extinguishing (cancelling) them transferring them and the common or green, or extinguishing them, as a result of a statutory disposition listed in the Regulations, Schedule 4, paragraph 8, table, Column 3 - Relevant instrument . Only the person who makes the primary application can apply to make an apportionment. If the applicant doesn’t make a primary application then the apportionment can’t be registered as a historic event. But it may be possible for the applicant to register the apportionment as a new event , as new event apportionments don’t require a primary application to be made at the same time. Evidence you need To register a historic apportionment of a right of common, you need: application form CA14 a primary application (which must be made by the same person who makes the apportionment) the register unit number the entry number in the rights register the details (including map) of the whole of the dominant tenement before apportionment the details (including map) of the new dominant tenement after apportionment the name and address of the owner of the dominant tenement affected by the primary application Applicants must also include a calculation of how the rights are apportioned. Generally this should be pro rata (the proportion of the applicant’s share of the overall area of the dominant tenement is used to calculate their share of the rights). For example, a right of common to graze 100 sheep is attached to a dominant tenement of 40 hectares. The owner sells 5 hectares. The purchaser’s share would be calculated as: total number of rights over the common (100) divided by the total area of the dominant tenement (40) multiplied by the purchaser’s share of the dominant tenement (5). This would give the purchaser a right to graze 12.5 sheep on the common. You must round down fractional rights, in this example to 12 sheep. This cancels any fractional rights. If the rights haven’t been apportioned pro rata, applicants need to supply evidence to justify why not. If an apportionment was caused by a statutory disposition made on or after 28 June 2005 then the apportionment must be pro rata unless the statutory disposition itself shows that another outcome was intended. Ignore testimonies from any parties to the statutory disposition after it comes into effect. Rights can’t be apportioned if they’re attached to a dwelling or the right is unquantified (it can’t be measured by weight, size or number). The following unquantified rights can’t be apportioned because they would be likely to increase the burden on the common: estover - the right to take specific products, such as timber, firewood or bracken piscary - the right to take fish turbary - the right to take turf or peat If an unquantified right is for the benefit of the whole of the dominant tenement, rather than attached to a building, you may allow apportionment if it would not increase the overall burden on the common. For example, a right to take bracken for cattle bedding may imply a right to take enough bedding for all the cattle that may be kept on the dominant tenement over winter. If the dominant tenement is divided into 2 or more separately owned holdings, you may allow each of those holdings the same right, because it would be limited by the number of cattle that can be kept on that holding over winter. Once you’ve made a decision, quote The Commons Registration (England) Regulations 2014, Schedule 4, paragraph 18 in the notice on your website. Amend the register Use model entry 5 as a reference to amend the register. Historic severance of a right of common You can register historic severance (separation) of a right from the dominant tenement (the land that the right would be attached to) that happened before: 1 October 2008 in pioneer authorities 15 December 2014 in 2014 authorities You must refuse an application to register a severance that happened on or after 28 June 2005, as severances by instrument (such as a conveyance) aren’t allowed. From that date rights can only be severed if they’re transferred to a public body or are authorised under an Act. Unquantified rights can’t be severed, and neither can rights appendant (ancient rights that can’t be separated from their dominant tenement). Applications can only be made by: the person to whom the right of common was transferred as a result of the severance the owner of the right of common on the date of the application the owner of the dominant tenement Evidence you need To register a historic severance, you need: application form CA14 evidence that the applicant is either the person the right was transferred to on severance, the owner of the right of common or the owner of the dominant tenement the right was previously attached to the register unit number the entry number in the rights register the details of the dominant tenement, including a map evidence that clearly shows an intention to sever the right, which includes an instrument (eg conveyance) or other documentary evidence that shows the right has been severed or has been treated as such Once you’ve made a decision, quote The Commons Registration (England) Regulations 2014, Schedule 4, paragraph 19 in the notice on your website. Amend the register Use model entry 14 as a reference to amend the register. Historic transfer of rights of common held in gross Rights of common held in gross are deeds held by 1 or more people rather than being attached to land. You can register the transfer of rights of common in gross that was made in writing and happened before: 1 October 2008 in pioneer authorities 15 December 2014 in 2014 authorities Applications can only be made by: the registered owner of the right the owner of the right on the date of application Evidence you need To register a historic transfer of rights of common in gross, you need: application form CA14 evidence that the applicant is the registered owner or the current owner of the right the register unit number the entry number in the rights section evidence of the how the right was transferred (eg a deed or a chain of conveyances) Once you’ve made a decision, quote The Commons Registration (England) Regulations 2014, Schedule 4, paragraph 20 in the notice on your website. Amend the register Use model entry 8 as a reference to amend the register. Historic surrender or extinguishment of rights of common You can register the surrender (giving up) and extinguishment (cancellation) of a right of common if it occurred before: 1 October 2008 in pioneer authorities 15 December 2014 in 2014 authorities Applications can only be made by: the current owner of any part of the dominant tenement (the land that the right would be attached to) the owner of the right in gross when it was surrendered or extinguished the current owner of any part of the common that the rights were used on Rights extinguished by common law Rights might have been extinguished for the following reasons: the common and the rights used over it are owned by the same person (unity of ownership or seisin) the owner is shown to have permanently stopped using the rights (abandonment) when part of a common is enclosed, eg by a garden, and commoners don’t object (implied release) the common is destroyed (eg by being covered by the sea) or the product (eg peat) has run out there is a change in the dominant tenement that means that it can’t benefit from the rights - eg the right is attached to a house that is demolished and isn’t replaced, or the whole dominant tenement is converted into a reservoir You can’t accept these reasons for severances or extinguishments if they occurred on or after the following dates: 1 October 2008 in pioneer authorities 15 December 2014 in 2014 authorities Evidence you need To register a historic surrender or extinguishment of rights of common, you need: application form CA14 evidence that the applicant is the current owner of any part of the dominant tenement or the common, or the owner of the right in gross when it was extinguished the register unit number the rights entry number the details and a map of the dominant tenement (if relevant) evidence that the right was surrendered or extinguished (eg a deed) Once you’ve made a decision, quote The Commons Registration (England) Regulations 2014, Schedule 4, paragraph 16 in the notice on your website. Amend the register Use model entry 9 as a reference to amend the register. Historic statutory disposition Statutory dispositions are legal instruments that can acquire commons, greens and rights of common and either transfer the rights to alternative land or extinguish them from the register. There are many different types of statutory disposition - for example, a compulsory purchase order to acquire land for new housing. Statutory dispositions can: extinguish rights of common extinguish rights of access for open-air recreation extinguish rights to recreate on greens give new rights of common or recreation to the persons whose rights were removed stop land being classed as common land or greens create new common land or a green Anyone can apply to register a historic statutory disposition if a disposition under 1 of the relevant instruments listed in the Commons Registration (England) Regulations 2014, Schedule 4, paragraph 8, columns 1 and 2 of the table came into effect before: 1 October 2008 in pioneer authorities 15 December 2014 in 2014 authorities. You can make a proposal to register a statutory disposition by the end of 14 December 2017. Evidence you need To register historic statutory dispositions, you need: application form CA14 evidence of the statutory disposition or exchange, with a copy of any approval, authorisation, certificate or consent if relevant evidence that the statutory disposition has come into effect register unit numbers (if relevant) the rights entry number (if relevant) the details of the amendments to be made to the register (if relevant) Once you’ve made a decision, quote The Commons Registration (England) Regulations 2014, Schedule 4, paragraph 21 in the notice on your website. Amend the register You must amend the register using relevant model entries as reference. Use model entries 3, 4, 9, 13 for an exchange of land and model entries 15, 16, 17, 18 or 20 for an exchange of land .

/government/news/tough-decisions-reap-benefits-for-uk-fishermen,"Today the UK government reached a deal for for the UK fishing industry, achieving quota increases and ensuring sustainable fish stocks.  Tough decisions reap benefits for UK fishermen  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Tough UK driven decisions have delivered significant reform of the EU’s Common Fisheries Policy, leading to improvements in fish stocks, substantial quota increases and a more profitable industry, Fisheries Minister George Eustice has announced. The UK government fought hard to deliver a better deal for the UK fishing industry from the EU, achieving significant quota increases for iconic species like North Sea Cod next year, and a doubling of Channel Plaice, while continuing to conserve fish stocks in order to safeguard the future livelihoods of our fishing fleets and coastal communities. This showcases how UK-led reform in the EU can ensure the best of both worlds for our industry and consumers. This announcement follows negotiations at the annual EU Fisheries and Agriculture Council where fishing quotas for 2016 were agreed. Decisions were based on three clear principles: following the available scientific advice; achieving sustainable levels of fishing and reducing discards. As a result of UK-led reforms to ensure EU fisheries become more sustainable, the scientific evidence for many of our iconic species was positive this year. This has resulted in the UK being able to secure big quota increases for valuable fish such as: English Channel: +100% Plaice North Sea: +15% Cod, +47% Haddock Celtic Sea: +20% Hake Western Channel: +15% Sole Where we could bring fresh science to the table we were also able to lobby against unjustifiable, precautionary cuts and instead ensured quotas were looked at on a case-by-case basis to provide more stability for fishermen. This resulted in our achieving quota increases for Megrim (+5%) in the Celtic Sea, alongside important ‘rollovers’, meaning fishermen targeting species such Pollock, Skates and Rays and Monkfish in the Celtic Sea can continue to fish at 2015 levels next year. Commenting from Brussels, UK Fisheries Minister George Eustice said: These negotiations are the culmination of months of government-led work to secure the best possible deal for the UK fishing industry, and the tough decisions we’ve taken to manage fishing and recover fish stocks are paying off; this is a great December Council result for UK fishermen. I entered these discussions with the firm belief that any decisions need to support a profitable fishing industry, sustainable fish stocks and a healthy marine environment, and the significant quota increases we’ve achieved for iconic species like North Sea Cod demonstrate the success of this approach. We still have more to do to reach Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) for all quota species by 2020 and to deliver the full discard ban by 2019, but already fishermen are benefitting from the action we’ve taken in recent years to recover stocks. By fighting for the fishing industry, and making a clear case for the need for more sustainable fishing, we have got a good deal and shown we can get what we need in Europe. That’s just what we’re also doing in this European renegotiation – fighting hard for the UK. In some cases there will still be some reductions in quota, including decreases for Nephrops (Langoustines) in the North Sea. This is important to ensure fishing opportunities support the recovery and long-term sustainability of our stocks and, in line with this approach, fishing restrictions were also agreed to aid the recovery of sea bass stocks which have suffered from a long-term decline. This means that next year there will be a six month closure of commercial bass fisheries (January to June), with partial exemptions for low impact, inshore fisheries. Recreational anglers will also continue to be able to target the fish for in the first six months of the year on the basis they release them back, alive, into the water. Given the start of the demersal phase of the discard ban in January 2016 for species such as haddock, sole and plaice, the UK also ensured next year’s total allowable catch (TACs) took into account the ban on discarding fish. This resulted in a quota ‘uplift’ proportionate to the amount of fish estimated to have been previously discarded, of which the first 100 tonnes - and 10% of anything more – will be given to the ‘under 10 metre’ fleet to ensure we continue to deliver on Manifesto Commitments to support the smaller, inshore fleet. The UK also successfully negotiated a number of further concessions. These include: Days at sea kept at 2015 levels rather than reduced Maintaining 2015 quotas for a number of stocks, including: Irish Sea: Plaice Celtic Sea: Monkfish, Skates and Rays, Pollock And accepting proposals for cuts where necessary to protect stocks, including: Irish Sea: -55% Sole North Sea: -3% Turbot and Brill, -19% Nephrops Bristol Channel: -9% Plaice More information: The Fisheries Minister George Eustice represented the UK in Brussels to ensure a package of measures that reflected the interests of all parts of the country. Richard Lochhead, Rebecca Evans and Michelle O’Neill also attended for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, respectively. The negotiations were the culmination of months of UK government-led meetings to hear from fishermen, devolved administrations, scientists and environmental NGOs to secure the best possible deal in order to meet our shared goals of a profitable fishing industry, sustainable fish stocks and a healthy marine environment. Fishermen in the North East and Scotland also benefitted from the formal acceptance of our early agreements with Norway on fishing opportunities in Norway’s North Sea waters. These provided our fishermen with a further 1,630 tonnes of cod and 12,800 tonnes haddock, and an agreed ‘rollover’ of whiting and plaice, meaning fishermen can continue to catch these species at current 2015 levels next year. Negotiations with the Faroe Islands to allow us to catch a number of species at 2015 quota levels in Faroese waters were also agreed at Council today."
/government/news/tougher-dog-breeding-licence-controls-to-protect-puppies,"Tougher dog breeding licensing to protect the welfare of puppies from back street breeders will be introduced under proposals announced today. Tougher dog breeding licence controls to protect puppies  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs A consultation is seeking to strengthen the regulations around dog breeding and pet sales to make it easier to identify and take action against irresponsible breeders who pay little regard to the health and welfare of the puppies they raise. This is a particular problem amongst smaller breeding establishments – known as ‘backstreet breeders’ – which supply thousands of dogs to UK families each year. Animal Welfare Minister George Eustice said: We are a nation of dog lovers but it is crucial that puppies are cared for properly and socialised in the first three months if they are to enjoy healthy and happy lives. We are aiming to reform the licensing regime we have so that smaller puppy breeding establishments must abide by the same regulations and licensing rules as bigger breeders so that the worst offenders can be dealt with more quickly. We are also reviewing other animal related licensed activities such as pet sales to address problems associated with the growing trend for internet sales that can contribute to impulse buying. The consultation will tighten up the licensing regulations for breeders by clarifying existing rules requiring any breeding businesses to have a licence. The proposals will also increase the number of smaller backstreet breeders - who may not consider themselves a business - that will require a licence by making it a requirement for anyone producing three or more litters of puppies in a year. The consultation also seeks to formalise the adoption of existing model conditions on good breeding health and welfare by making it a requirement of breeders to comply with the conditions and for local authorities to use them. Claire Horton, CEO of Battersea Dogs & Cats Home and non-executive Director of AHWBE , said: Battersea Dogs & Cats Home has long recognised the cruel problem of backstreet breeding in Britain. The government’s proposals are extremely encouraging, having listened to the important calls we have made in our nationwide campaign to end this unacceptable practice. Reducing the number of litters a breeder can produce in a year, without a licence, will ensure that more breeders will be brought under the scope of regulation, which we believe will protect the lives and welfare of more of the vulnerable dogs who really need it. It will also provide greater protection for buyers – those looking to take on a dog deserve to be confident that their puppy has been given the best start in life, and bred by a responsible, properly-regulated breeder. Local authorities will also be able to better target their enforcement activity by directing less resource at responsible businesses, for example those who are controlled by the Kennel Club’s UKAS -accredited Assured Breeders’ Scheme - which has 6,000 members. This will free up resources to follow-up on reports of poor welfare at backstreet breeding establishments. For the first time, the consultation will also clarify that online retailers selling puppies should be treated in the same way as high street pet shops by local authorities – meaning they must abide by the same licensing and welfare regulations. Through the Pet Advisory Action Group (PAAG) – Defra and welfare charities have worked with six major online advertising sites to remove over 130,000 inappropriate adverts of pets where there were concerns about the welfare and background of the animal. PAAG is now looking at broadening this successful approach to other sites, and to educate prospective buyers to what they should be looking out for if they are looking for a pet online, such as if can they visit and see the dog with its mother before they buy and check that the seller is a properly licensed breeder."
/government/news/longest-stretch-of-englands-coastline-to-open-for-public,"Progress on England's Coast Path with more miles set to open in the spring. Longest stretch of England's coastline to open for public  Natural England Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Work is now underway to open up half of England’s coastline as part of wider government plans to complete a path around the whole of the English coast. The announcement by Rural Minister Rory Stewart marks the latest milestone in the delivery of one of the world’s longest walkways. The England Coast Path will stretch out across 2700 miles of stunning walking routes covering 100% of the country. Already families can explore 101 miles of our spectacular coastline via the England Coast Path in Cumbria, Durham, Dorset and Norfolk, with a further 95 miles of new routes set to open in Kent and Somerset in the spring. We are working closely with Natural England to build on the progress already made, with the aim of completing the coastal path around England by 2020. Walking in the countryside is good for people’s health and wellbeing, and providing more access to our coastline brings huge benefits by both connecting us with nature and boosting local tourism. Tourism is hugely important to the rural economy, contributing around £11 billion each year – and by attracting even more visitors to explore our iconic coastline, we expect the England Coast Path to benefit even more local businesses like pubs and hotels. Welcoming the development Rural Minister Rory Stewart said: As an historic seafaring nation, a deep connection with our coastline is an integral part of our national identity. None of us lives further than about 75 miles from the sea, and most of us live much closer, so it’s vital to our ongoing relationship with our countryside that the public has easy access to our outstanding coastline. We have already opened up miles of our beautiful coastline for everyone to enjoy, boosting local tourism and growing the rural economy, so it makes sense to extend these plans even further. We know that walking in the countryside is good for people’s health and wellbeing, and what better way to do it than with the accompaniment of a nice sea breeze? Andrew Sells, Natural England’s Chairman added: This is the most significant footpath project for a generation, it will be an incredible legacy for our island nation and I’m delighted to report on our excellent progress this year. Visitors from home and abroad enjoy our spectacular coastlines and love to walk our National Trails, which pass through some of our most stunning countryside. We know from our evidence of spending by visitors to the coast, that the route will boost the local economy and help support coastal communities. We are on target and have built a momentum to complete the entire route by 2020. Work to open up or improve access along our coast is also underway around the country with work recently started in Essex, Devon, Hampshire, Lincolnshire and Lancashire, and Natural England, which is coordinating the development of these routes, will be continually opening up new paths over the next five years. The new routes will also improve public access to our coastline, beaches and foreshore, with existing coastal footpaths used where possible, or in some cases moved nearer the sea so walkers have a better opportunity to properly enjoy our coastal views and beaches. The England Coast Path will be a well way-marked National Trail around the whole of the English coast, passing through some of our country’s finest and iconic landscapes such as the White Cliffs of Dover, St Bees Head, and the sunny beaches of the South West, together with picture postcard villages and the cities that plot our colourful maritime history. Further information You can read further information and updates on Natural England’s progress in completing the England Coast Path . To establish the route the coast of England has been divided into 66 ‘stretches’ with eight Natural England delivery teams working around the country. The teams work closely with local authorities, land owners and occupiers, communities, interest groups and others to ensure the best and most appropriate alignment for the new coast path. For the first time, the legislation under which the route is created also enables Natural England to identify where the route will naturally roll back if it is eroded away by the sea, safeguarding the pathway for the future.

/government/news/green-light-for-north-yorkshire-coastal-path,"New coastal paths have been approved from Filey Brigg to Newport Bridge and Dunball Wharf to and St Audries Bay. Green light for North Yorkshire coastal path  Natural England Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs The longest single section of coastal path ever to be approved has been given the green light by Environment Secretary Elizabeth Truss today, giving walkers access to nearly 70 miles of stunning sea views between Filey Brigg in North Yorkshire and Middlesbrough’s Newport Bridge. Once works are complete, the new path will stretch around the coast of North-East England along the edge of the North York Moors National Park, passing through Scarborough, Robin Hood’s Bay and Whitby before ending at Middlesbrough’s iconic bridge across the River Tees. Coastal paths play an important role in attracting visitors to explore rural and coastal communities, meaning more trade for local shops, pubs and hotels which contributes to the UK’s booming £11billion tourism industry. Commenting on the approval, Rural Affairs Minister Rory Stewart said: We have already opened miles of coastal paths across the country, enabling thousands of people to enjoy our spectacular coastline. We are an island nation, and the coast and the sea is a central part of what it means to be British. North Yorkshire features breath-taking scenery, wild, windswept clifftop walks and vast expanses of sandy shore, incredible places for residents and visitors. The new paths announced today will give people easy access to our outstanding coastline as a place to simply rest, relax and admire the view—something that’s crucial for our health and well-being – but also for some of the most testing, energetic walks in Britain. Along the new path walkers will be able to enjoy historic sites including the spectacular gothic ruins of Whitby Abbey, a stroll to the end of Yorkshire’s only Victorian pier in Saltburn, and picturesque harbour views in the village of Staithes, home of the explorer Captain Cook. The Environment Secretary also approved plans to alter the route at Dunball Wharf and St Audries Bay, part of the Somerset coastal path covering the stretch between Brean Down and Minehead, to provide in one place an alternative route so that walkers can avoid the need for a descent from the clifftop to the beach. The approval of plans for further coastal paths follow the latest milestone in the delivery of one of the world’s longest walkways in December, when Minister Stewart announced the half-way point in government plans to complete a path around the whole of the English coast. Set for completion in 2020, the England Coast Path will stretch across 2700 miles of walking routes, covering 100% of the country. Notes to Editors: Work will now begin to prepare this new stretch of coast path in North Yorkshire for public use. The new access rights will commence once the route has been established and works have been completed. Two variations to the coastal path at Dunball Wharf and St Audries Bay in Somerset have been approved. The new access rights for the 58 mile stretch between Brean Down and Minehead will commence once the route has been established and works have been completed.

You must provide enough drinking containers for the number of animals. Feeding You must position any feeding equipment so that: animals can reach food easily animals can’t foul them you can refill them easily Where practical, you must fix containers in position. You must provide enough feeding equipment for the number of animals. Ventilation You must have natural or mechanical ventilation to protect animals from: extreme temperatures harmful levels of humidity harmful levels of ammonia Your AWO or company veterinary adviser may offer guidance on the best levels for the species you handle. If you’ve installed a ventilation system, it must respond to changing temperatures through the year. You must have an alarm and back-up system to cope with breakdowns of mechanical ventilation. Animal handling rules You must not handle any animal in a way that causes it pain or suffering. You must not: strike or kick an animal press sensitive areas of an animal’s body that would cause pain or suffering twist, crush or break an animal’s tail grasp an animal’s eyes prods or other implements with pointed ends drag an animal by the head, ears, tail or handle them in a way that would cause pain or suffering Moving animals to the place of killing You must only move animals to the place of killing when you’re ready to stun them, and kill them straight away. You must locate the place of killing so that it avoids unnecessary handling of animals up until the point of killing. Restraining poultry, rabbits and hares You need to restrain animals before you stun and kill them. Your equipment for restraining animals must: allow you to stun or kill an animal effectively prevent injury or cuts to animals minimise struggling and vocalisation minimise the time an animal’s restrained If you’re using stunning equipment on an animal’s head, your restraining equipment must present an animal’s head correctly for an accurate stun. You can only use restraining equipment to restrain animals by following the manufacturers’ instructions. Shackle lines for poultry Shackle lines must be designed for the size, type and weight of the poultry you’re handling in your slaughterhouse. You must not shackle animals if they’re too small for the shackles or if shackling is likely to cause pain or injury The shackles must be the right size and shape for the legs of the birds so that electrical contact can be made without hurting the birds. The shackles must be wet. You must shackle both legs. Position of shackle lines You must position shackle lines so that: you can reach the whole shackle line easily and you can take an animal off it at any time, right up to the scald tank you can easily reach the equipment controls at any time the shackles are in continuous contact with the earthed rubbing bar, when they pass over the waterbath When the birds are on the shackle line they must not touch any objects or each other, even when their wings are stretched out be relaxed not be disturbed Shackle lines: breast support If you have new shackle line it must have a support in contact with the breast of the bird to stop it swinging and calm it down. The support must start at the point where the birds are shackled and must extend to the waterbath. Speed of shackle line The shackle line must move slowly enough to make sure: you don’t distress the birds the automatic cutters work correctly as the birds pass through Maximum hanging time You must only hang conscious birds on a shackle line for a maximum of: 2 minutes - ducks, geese and turkeys 1 minute - other poultry If you were using a shackle line before 1 January 2013, you can hang the birds for a maximum of: 3 minutes - turkeys 2 minutes - other poultry From 8 December 2019 the maximum hanging times are the same for all businesses: ducks, geese and turkeys - 2 minutes chickens and other poultry - 1 minute Stunning animals You must stun all animals before you kill them, unless you’re carrying out religious slaughter . Simple stunning Simple stunning is where you stun an animal to make it unconscious but don’t kill it. It must make the animal unconscious immediately and it must stay unconscious until it’s dead. You must then immediately use another method to kill the animal. Stunning methods include: percussive blow to the head (rabbits only) neck dislocation (poultry only - use as a back-up method only) non-penetrative captive bolt (avoiding skull fracture) captive bolt firearms electrical stunning waterbath stunning (poultry only) gas stunning (poultry only) Equipment for stunning or killing Any equipment you use for stunning or killing must: stun or kill rapidly and effectively be in good working order have the manufacturer’s instructions on how to operate it You must have back-up stunning equipment available immediately in case your main equipment fails. Maintain your equipment You must maintain equipment following the manufacturer’s instructions. You must keep maintenance records for at least a year. The Food Standards Agency can ask to see them. Stunning: equipment and monitoring You must monitor each slaughter line to check animals are being effectively stunned. Between stunning and killing, you must check animals for signs of consciousness. You must have a CoC on checking effectiveness of stunning. Your slaughterhouse’s standard operating procedure should also list what monitoring procedures will be used Review your sampling rate The frequency of your checks that stunning is effective will depend on the main risk factors such as: how often you change the species or size and weight of animals on a slaughter line the length of each shift the results of previous sampling - you’ll need to increase the sampling rate if a previous check found a high percentage of animals were not effectively stunned If you find an animal that hasn’t been properly stunned, you must take immediate action in line with your slaughterhouse’s standard operating procedure . If you’re failing to stun animals properly, you must find out what’s wrong and correct your operation immediately. What to record You must check a representative sample of the animals you’re stunning. For each sample, you must record: the number of animals the name of the person monitoring the time and circumstances (for example, immediately after stunning an animal) any factors affecting the efficiency of the stunning process whether your findings are consistent with previous monitoring tests of unconsciousness and how to interpret the results religious slaughter - tests for signs of life and how to interpret the results Waterbath stunning for poultry You must install a waterbath that’s a good size and depth for the birds that your slaughterhouse processes. You must be able to adjust the water level for different birds so that there is a good contact with each bird’s head. All species of bird must be in the water up to the base of their wings. Entrance to waterbath Waterbaths must have an electrically insulated entry ramp so poultry don’t get an electric shock before they enter the waterbath. You must make sure the waterbath doesn’t overflow at the entrance to prevent pre-stun shocks. Current and duration To make birds unconscious immediately and to keep them unconscious until they’re dead, you must make sure: the voltage produces a strong enough current you expose the birds for at least 4 seconds You must make sure the current and duration are sufficient to stun all the birds. If any birds aren’t stunned effectively you must immediately stun and kill them. Electrical waterbath stunning: minimum average current and frequency per bird Frequency (Hz) Chickens Turkeys Ducks and geese Quail 200 Hz 100 milliamps ( mA ) 250mA 130mA 45mA From 200 to 400Hz 150mA 400mA illegal illegal From 400 to 1,500Hz 200mA 400mA illegal illegal Record the voltage and current Your stunning equipment must display and record the voltage and current. You must be able to see the display clearly, and you must be able to see and hear a warning easily. These rules apply to equipment that is new after 1 January 2013 and all equipment from 8 December 2019. You must keep the records for each piece of equipment for a year. Breakdowns You must be able to get to the waterbath to kill any animals that have been stunned but stay in the waterbath because of a breakdown or a delay in the line. Gas stunners You can’t use high concentrations of carbon dioxide on ducks and geese You can only use gas stunners by following the manufacturers’ instructions. Gas stunners and their conveyors must: expose birds to the gas long enough to kill them be designed, constructed and maintained to avoid any injury to the bird Monitor gas concentration Gas stunners must be able to maintain the correct concentration of gas - they must have a monitoring device that constantly measures and displays the gas concentration. Equipment that is new after 1 January 2013 and all equipment from 8 December 2019 must also record the gas concentration. The monitoring device must show a warning and sound an alarm if gas concentration falls below the legal level. You must be able to see the monitoring device easily. You must be able to see and monitor the poultry in the gas stunner. You must be able to: quickly flush the gas stunner with air to enter the chamber get to the poultry in the shortest amount of time No animals can be in the gas stunner if: there’s a problem with the equipment the gas concentration falls below the required concentration the alarm sounds or the warning lights display Shackling after gas stunning Gas stunning must kill the birds. After gas stunning, you must wait until the birds are dead and check they’re dead in line with your standard operating procedures before you can shackle them.. Back-up equipment You must have back-up equipment you can use immediately available if your main equipment fails. Gas mixtures You must use one of the following gas mixtures to kill poultry by gas: carbon dioxide at high concentration (you must not use this method on ducks and geese) carbon dioxide in 2 phases carbon dioxide mixed with inert gases inert gases You must not allow gases to enter into the chamber (or the location where animals are to be stunned and killed) in a way that could create burns or excitement. This could be caused by the gases by freezing or lack of humidity. Carbon dioxide at high concentration The minimum concentration is 40% carbon dioxide. Exposure of a conscious animal to the gas must lead to anoxia (loss of oxygen to the brain). You must make sure that no animal enters the gas stunner if the carbon dioxide concentration by volume falls below 40%. You must not use this method on ducks and geese. Carbon dioxide in 2 phases Expose the animal to gas with a maximum concentration of 40% carbon dioxide. When the animal is unconscious, use a higher concentration of carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide mixed with inert gases Expose conscious animals directly or progressively to a gas mixture containing up to 30% of carbon dioxide mixed with inert gases. This will lead to anoxia. You’re breaking the law if you put birds in the chamber when gas concentrations are over: 30% carbon dioxide 2% oxygen (however, the oxygen concentration can rise up to 5% for no more than 30 seconds) Inert gases Expose conscious animals directly or progressively to a gas mixture containing an inert gas mixture (such as argon or nitrogen) leading to anoxia. You must make sure that the oxygen concentration by volume is less than 2% (however, the oxygen concentration can rise up to 5% for no more than 30 seconds). Head-only electrical stunning If you’re using electrodes that span an animal’s brain, you must use these minimum currents: chickens - 240mA turkeys - 400mA The electrodes must be in good contact with the animal and the strength and duration of the current must make the animal unconscious. The stunning equipment must have a visible or audible device indicating length of time of its application to the animal. It should also clearly indicate to the operator the voltage and current under load. Captive bolt stunning You must use devices, including cartridge strength, in line with the manufacturer’s instructions. Penetrative captive bolt You can use penetrative captive bolt devices for simple stunning for all species. You must: position the device so the bolt enters through the cerebral cortex (top of the brain) check the bolt has retracted to its full extent after each shot If the bolt hasn’t fully retracted, you must not use the device until it’s repaired. Non-penetrative captive bolt You can use non-penetrative captive bolt devices for simple stunning and ensure they’re used in the correct position to avoid the fracture of the skull. Bleeding poultry When you bleed poultry after stunning, you must cut the two neck (carotid) arteries properly and without delay. You must make sure each animal bleeds out quickly, completely and dies as soon as possible, without regaining consciousness. If you kill poultry by bleeding following stunning, you must leave birds to fully bleed out for at least: 2 minutes - turkeys and geese 90 seconds - other birds You must check for signs of life once bleeding has ended before you dress birds or use any electrical equipment on poultry. You’ll find a list of indicators for signs of life in your slaughterhouse’s standard operating procedures . Automatic neck cutters If you’re using automatic neck cutters, they must cut both neck arteries. If they don’t, you must kill the bird straight away using another method. Emergency killing for poultry You can use the following to kill poultry as a back-up method to other forms of stunning: manual cervical (neck) dislocation, for birds under 3kg, up to a maximum of 70 birds a day per person mechanical cervical dislocation for birds up to 5kg Bleeding rabbits and hares You must bleed rabbits following stunning. You must cut both arteries in the neck. You must make sure bleeding is quick and complete. Stunning using a percussive blow to the head This is a simple stun method that can only be used on rabbits that weigh under 5 kg. You must give a firm and accurate blow to the head that leads to unconsciousness."
/guidance/knackers-yards-and-farms-restraining-stunning-killing-animals,"How to restrain, stun and kill animals which aren't for human consumption. Knacker's yards and farms: restraining, stunning, killing animals  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs You need a welfare of animals at the time of killing ( WATOK ) licence or a certificate of competence ( CoC ) if you’re doing any of the following where the animal is not for human consumption: restraining animals for stunning or killing stunning animals checking stunning has worked shackling or hoisting live animals bleeding live animals pithing animals you’ve stunned assessment of effective pithing You need a WATOK licence or a CoC if you’re carrying out any of those operations on the following animals, if they’re not for human consumption: horses and donkeys (solipeds) cattle, sheep, goats and deer (ruminants) pigs rabbits poultry ostriches (ratites) You must hold a WATOK licence for each procedure you carry out. You risk losing your licence or CoC and you may be committing an offence if you don’t follow these and other WATOK requirements . Restraining animals You need to restrain an animal in the appropriate manner before you stun or kill it. Your equipment for restraining animals must: be in good working order maintained and checked in accordance with manufacturers’ instructions used in accordance with manufacturers’ instructions allow you to stun or kill an animal effectively and quickly present the animal’s head in a way that allows you to stun it accurately You must only put animals into restraining equipment, including head restraints, when you’re ready to stun or kill the animal. Stunning pens for cattle For adult cattle (which includes bovine animals such as buffalo and bison) you must use a stunning pen or restraining pen. You must follow the manufacturer’s instructions. Stunning pens and restraining boxes must: be in good working order maintained and checked - follow the manufacturer’s instructions be able to fit one animal at a time without discomfort stop the animal from making any large movements forwards, backwards or sideways allow complete access to an animal’s forehead, for accurate stunning Restrict cattle head movements Stunning pens and restraining boxes for cattle must have a device to stop an animal’s head moving up and down so you can stun it accurately. The device must release an animal’s head immediately after stunning and shouldn’t cause the animals pain, distress, or suffering. Shackle lines Shackle lines must be designed for the size, type and weight of the poultry you’re handling in your knacker’s yard. The shackles must be the right size and shape for the legs of the birds so that electrical contact can be made without hurting the birds. The shackles must be wet. You must shackle both legs. Position of shackle lines You must position shackle lines so that: you can reach the whole shackle line easily and you can take an animal off it at any time if it suffers pain or distress you can easily reach the equipment controls at any time If you’re hanging up poultry before stunning or killing, the birds must: be relaxed not touch any objects or each other, even when their wings are stretched out not be disturbed Speed of shackle line The shackle line must move slowly enough to make sure you: don’t distress the birds can take any measures to prevent pain, suffering or distress Maximum hanging time You must only hang conscious birds on a shackle line for: 3 minutes - turkeys 2 minutes - other poultry Restraining methods you can’t use If you’re restraining animals, you can’t: suspend or hoist them while they’re conscious, except for poultry use electrical stunning equipment or shock devices to immobilise an animal Animal stunning and killing You must stun all animals before you kill them and then kill them immediately. You need to make sure the animal stays unconscious so it can’t feel pain when you kill it. Simple stunning ‘Simple stunning’ is stunning an animal to make it lose consciousness in a way that doesn’t instantly kill it. Equipment for stunning or killing Any equipment you use for stunning or killing must: stun or kill rapidly and effectively be in good working order have the manufacturer’s instructions on how to operate it You must have back-up stunning equipment available immediately on the spot, in case your main equipment fails. Maintain your equipment You must maintain equipment following the manufacturer’s instructions. You must keep maintenance records for at least a year. An inspector can ask to see them. Check that your stunning method is effective When you’ve stunned an animal, you must check if it’s still conscious before you kill it. If an animal is still conscious you must immediately re-stun it. You must have a WATOK licence or CoC on checking effectiveness of stunning. Your knacker’s yard standard operating procedure should also list what monitoring procedures will be used. If you find an animal that hasn’t been properly stunned, you must immediately re-stun it and take immediate action in line with your knacker’s yard standard operating procedure. If you’re failing to stun animals properly, you must find out what’s wrong and correct your operation immediately. Stunning by firearm with free projectile You can use a firearm to stun all animals - this stunning method kills by causing severe damage to the animal’s brain when the gun is fired. You should fire it at the head and use a cartridge or bullet that will kill the animal instantly. The manufacturer’s instructions will show you what cartridge or bullet to use. Killing by a percussive blow to the head You can kill rabbits that weigh less than 5kg by hitting them in the head with a firm and accurate blow. You must kill them after you’ve stunned them. Electrical stunning Electrical stunning is a method of simple stunning so you’ll need to follow it with another operation to kill the animal once it’s unconscious. When you carry out electrical stunning: there must be a good electrical contact with the animal electrodes must span the brain of the animal and be adapted for the size of animal, for head-only stunning the current must be strong enough and you must subject the animal to it for long enough to make them unconscious until death you must kill the animal before it recovers consciousness you must use the minimum currents below Monitor electrical stunning For each animal you stun, your equipment must be fitted with a device that shows the: voltage current length of time of the stun The device must be clearly visible to staff carrying out stunning. If the electrodes don’t deliver the right current or voltage for the right amount of time, the device must give a clearly visible and audible warning. Minimum currents for head-only electrical stunning Species Minimum current Cattle 6 months or older 1.28 amps (A) Cattle younger than 6 months 1.25A Sheep and goats 1.0A Pigs 1.3A Chickens 240 milliamps ( mA ) Turkeys 400mA Head-to-body electrical stunning If you’re using electrodes on an animal’s head and body, you must use these currents: sheep and goats - 1A pigs - 1.3A Waterbath stunning Waterbath stunning is a simple stunning method for poultry - this means you need to kill the animal after you stun it, and before it regains consciousness. To carry out waterbath stunning you must: install a waterbath that’s a good size and depth for the birds that your knacker’s yard processes be able to adjust the water level for different birds to ensure that there’s good contact with each bird’s head make sure the electrode is immersed in water and extends for the length of the waterbath Entrance to waterbath You must make sure the waterbath doesn’t overflow at the entrance. If it does, you must make sure that poultry don’t receive a shock before they’re stunned. Current and duration To make birds unconscious immediately and to keep them unconscious until they’re dead, you must make sure: there are good electrical contacts the voltage is maintained at a strong enough current to ensure every bird is stunned immediately you expose the birds for at least 4 seconds If you’re stunning groups of birds, you must make sure the current and duration stuns all the birds enough to keep them unconscious until they have been killed by a follow-up method. Electrical waterbath stunning: average current and frequency Frequency (Hertz) Chickens - average current Turkeys - average current Ducks and geese - average current Quail - average current 200Hz 100mA 250mA 130mA 45mA From 200 to 400Hz 150mA 400mA illegal illegal From 400 to 1,500Hz 200mA 400mA illegal illegal Breakdowns If there’s a breakdown or delay in the shackle line you must be able to access the shackle line or waterbath to: kill any animals that have been stunned but remain in the waterbath Captive bolt stunning You must use devices in line with the manufacturer’s instructions, including positioning and using the correct strength of cartridge. Penetrative captive bolt You can use penetrative captive bolt devices for simple stunning for all species. You must check the bolt has retracted to its full extent after each shot. If the bolt hasn’t fully retracted, you mustn’t use the device until it’s repaired You must shoot animals in the middle of the forehead. But if you’re stunning sheep and goats that have horns, you can shoot the animal in the back of the head. You must aim the shot just behind the base of the horns and aim towards the mouth. You must bleed or kill sheep and goats with horns that are shot in the back of the head within 15 seconds of shooting them. You must not shoot a bovine in the back of the head. Non-penetrative captive bolt You can only use non-penetrative captive bolt devices for simple stunning on cattle, sheep, goats and deer under 10kg. You must apply the device in the proper position and use the correct strength of cartridge according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cervical (neck) dislocation of poultry You can only use manual cervical dislocation if: the bird weigh less than 3kg there are no other methods available You can only use manual cervical dislocation on up to 70 birds a day. You can only use mechanical cervical dislocation if: the bird weighs less than 5kg there are no other methods available Gas stunning Gas stunning is a method of killing pigs in knacker’s yards and poultry on-farm and in knacker’s yards. You must use the gas stunner in line with the manufacturer’s instructions. You can only use whole house gas stunning for poultry and under the supervision of a veterinary surgeon. If you’re culling poultry on-farm using gas stunning, you must write to the Animal and Plant Health Agency 5 days in advance. You must expose each animal to the gas for long enough to kill it. You must use a gas stunner which allows you to: check the animals are suffering no avoidable pain, suffering or distress while you’re stunning them get to the animals as quickly as possible in case of an emergency, eg machinery breakdown flush the stunner with air so you can enter the chamber as quickly as possible For pigs, you must make sure the gas stunner and its conveyors: doesn’t injure or bruise the animals or compress their chest minimises struggling or vocalisation allows animals to remain standing until they lose consciousness has adequate lighting to allow pigs to see other pigs or their surroundings while on the conveyor leading to the gas stunner, and while in the stunner gets animals to the point of maximum gas concentration within 30 seconds, if you’re using a high concentration of carbon dioxide For poultry, you must make sure the: gas stunners and their conveyors don’t injure the birds poultry are put in the stunner in a way that minimises pain, distress and suffering Gas monitoring devices Gas stunners must have a monitoring device that displays the gas concentration. The device must be clearly visible to staff. If the gas concentration falls below the correct level, the monitoring device must display a clear visible warning and sound an alarm. No pig or bird must go into the stunner or remain in it if: there’s a problem with the gas stunner the alarm goes off the gas concentration falls below the correct level Gas mixtures To kill poultry by gas, you must use one of the following gas mixtures: carbon dioxide at high concentration (except ducks and geese) carbon dioxide in 2 phases carbon dioxide mixed with inert gases inert gases For pigs you can use: carbon dioxide at high concentration carbon dioxide mixed with inert gases inert gases You can’t use carbon monoxide pure source for pigs or poultry. You must not allow gases to enter into the chamber (or the location where animals are to be stunned and killed) in a way that could create burns or excitement. This could be caused by the gases by freezing or lack of humidity. You must only stun pigs or poultry by gas if each animal is exposed to the gas for long enough to make sure it’s killed. Carbon dioxide at high concentration - pigs The minimum concentration is 80% carbon dioxide. Exposure of conscious pigs to the gas must lead to anoxia (loss of oxygen to the brain). You must make sure that no pig enters the gas stunner if the carbon dioxide concentration by volume falls below 80%. Carbon dioxide at high concentration - poultry The minimum concentration is 40% carbon dioxide. Exposure of conscious birds to the gas must lead to anoxia. You must make sure that no bird enters the gas stunner if the carbon dioxide concentration by volume falls below 40%. You can’t use a high concentration of carbon dioxide on ducks and geese. Carbon dioxide in 2 phases – poultry Expose the animal to gas with a maximum concentration of 40% carbon dioxide. When the animal is unconscious, use a higher concentration of carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide mixed with inert gases - pigs Expose conscious pigs directly or progressively to a gas mixture containing up to 40% of carbon dioxide mixed with inert gases. This will lead to anoxia. The maximum concentration is 40% carbon dioxide. Direct or progressive exposure of conscious pigs to the gas must lead to anoxia. Carbon dioxide mixed with inert gases - poultry For poultry you must make sure that gas concentrations by volume are at most: 20% carbon dioxide 5% oxygen Inert gases - poultry and pigs Expose conscious animals directly or progressively to a gas mixture containing an inert gas mixture (such as argon or nitrogen) leading to anoxia. You must make sure that the oxygen concentration by volume is 2% or less, for poultry. Lethal injections A vet can lethally inject animals with veterinary medicines to kill them. Killing animals by bleeding or pithing After you’ve used a simple stunning method on animals, you need to kill them while they’re still unconscious by bleeding or pithing. Bleeding To kill an animal by bleeding, you must cut the 2 carotid arteries in its neck. You must bleed the animal: immediately after simple stunning as quickly and completely as possible before it regains consciousness If you bleed an animal after simple stunning, you must not dress the animal or stimulate it electrically until: bleeding has stopped you’ve confirmed there are no signs of life You must wait for these minimum times until you dress animals: 30 seconds - cattle 20 seconds - sheep and goats 2 minutes for turkey or geese 90 seconds for all other birds Killing horses You must kill a horse in a separate room or a bay which is kept specifically for that purpose. You must not kill a horse: in sight of another horse in a room where there are remains of another horse or other animal Hatchery waste You can only kill chicks that are less 72 hours old and the killing must be as rapid as possible. You can only use one of the following methods: maceration (immediate crushing of an entire animal) gas - chicks must die quickly and stay in the gas until they are dead cervical (neck) dislocation but only if there are no other methods available If using gas you must use one of the following gases: carbon dioxide at high concentrations carbon dioxide in 2 phases carbon dioxide mixed with inert gases inert gases pure source carbon monoxide carbon monoxide mixed with inert gases"

Slaughtering poultry, rabbits and hares on farms for small-scale suppliers  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs If you handle, stun or kill animals, you must be competent to do so . You risk losing your licence or prosecution if you don’t follow these and other Welfare of Animals at the Time of Killing requirements . When you’re classed as a small-scale supplier You’re classed as a small-scale supplier if all of these apply: you slaughter less than 10,000 birds, rabbits or hares per year on your farm you supply the birds, rabbits or hares directly to the final consumer or to local shops you supply meat within your own county and the adjoining counties (or no further than 50 kilometres from your county’s border) You still count as a small-scale, local supplier even if you sell poultry to the whole of the UK in the 2 weeks before Christmas, Easter and Michaelmas (usually in late September). On-farm slaughter of more than 10,000 birds You’re also classed as a small-scale supplier if you slaughter more than 10,000 birds on your farm and you’re a member of an assurance scheme approved by the Food Standards Agency and you either: dry pluck by hand slaughter for fewer than 40 days per year Poultry awaiting sale You must make sure that poultry being offered for sale are put in accommodation where they can stand upright, turn and stretch their wings without difficulty. You must also give the poultry food and clean water and do this as soon as possible. Restraining animals You must restrain animals before you can stun or kill them. If you’re using stunning equipment on an animal’s head, your restraining equipment must present an animal’s head correctly for an accurate stun. Your equipment for restraining animals must: allow you to stun or kill an animal effectively prevent injury, cuts or bruises minimise struggling and vocalisation minimise the time an animal’s restrained You must follow the manufacturer’s instructions when using equipment to restrain animals. What you must not do You mustn’t handle any animal in a way that causes it pain. You mustn’t: strike or kick an animal press sensitive areas of an animal’s body that would cause pain or suffering use prods or other pointed implements twist, crush or break an animal’s tail grasp an animal’s eyes One animal at a time If you’re responsible for stunning and bleeding the animals, you must finish all these tasks on one animal before moving onto the next animal. Stunning animals You must stun all animals before you kill them on farms. Stunning and killing equipment Your equipment for stunning and killing animals must allow for a quick and effective stun and kill. You must maintain all stunning and killing equipment according to the manufacturer’s instructions, by people who are properly trained. You must keep a record of the maintenance work carried out for at least a year. Back-up equipment You must install back-up equipment so that you can use it quickly if your main equipment fails. You must keep it close by and it must be in good working order. Simple stunning Simple stunning is where you stun an animal to make it unconscious but don’t kill it. It must make the animal unconscious immediately and it must stay unconscious until it’s dead. You must then immediately use another method to kill the animal. Gas stunning (for poultry only) If you take birds out of crates before they go into a gas stunner, you must handle them with care to spare them any avoidable pain or distress. You don’t have to notify the Animal and Plant Health Agency ( APHA ) if you’re gas stunning for small scale slaughter. You must give APHA 5 days’ notice if you plan to gas birds for management reasons, eg culling. Gas stunning equipment Gas stunners or any equipment that conveys birds into the gas must be designed to avoid injuring birds - you must follow the manufacturer’s instructions. Gas stunners must be able to maintain the correct concentration of gas. You must be able to flush the stunner with air so that you can get to the poultry immediately if there’s a problem. Monitoring poultry in gas stunners You must be able to visually monitor the poultry. Gas stunners must have a monitoring device that displays and records the gas concentration. The monitoring device must display a warning and sound an alarm if the gas concentration falls below the legal level. No birds must go into or remain in the stunner if: there’s a problem with the gas stunner the alarm goes off the gas concentration falls below the legal level Gas mixtures To gas stun poultry, you must use one of the following gas mixtures: carbon dioxide at high concentration (you must not use this for ducks and geese) carbon dioxide in 2 phases carbon dioxide mixed with inert gases inert gases You must not allow gases to enter into the chamber (or the location where animals are to be stunned and killed) in a way that could create burns or excitement.

You must wait until the birds are dead before you carry out any other operation on them. Non-penetrative captive bolt If you use a non-penetrative captive bolt device, you must avoid fracturing the skull. You must use the correct strength of cartridge or propellant - find out what this is by reading the manufacturer’s instructions. Penetrative captive bolt If you use a penetrative captive bolt, you must: use the correct strength of cartridge as stated in the manufacturer’s instructions position the device so the bolt enters through the cerebral cortex (top of the brain) check the bolt has retracted to its full extent after each shot - if the bolt hasn’t fully retracted, you mustn’t use the device until it’s repaired Head-only electrical stunning If you carry out electrical stunning: there must be a good electrical contact with the animal electrodes must span the brain of the animal and be adapted for the size of animal the current must be strong enough to make an animal unconscious until it’s dead The equipment must have a device to show: the length of time you’ve applied the current to an animal the voltage and current Minimum currents for head-only electrical stunning: chickens - 240 milliamps ( mA ) turkeys - 400mA The minimum currents for rabbits and hares aren’t set out in EU law. You must kill the animal immediately after it becomes unconscious. Cervical (neck) dislocation You can manually dislocate birds’ necks if the birds up to 3kg - you can kill up to 70 per birds day. You can dislocate birds’ necks mechanically if they weight between 3kg and 5kg. You must only use these methods if there are no other methods available. Killing poultry, rabbits or hares The place of killing must be near to where the animals are held and avoids unnecessary handling of animals. After simple stunning, you must use a method such as bleeding (cutting the neck arteries) to kill the animals. When you bleed poultry, rabbits or hares you must cut the 2 neck arteries properly and make sure that the animals bleed out quickly and completely, and before regaining consciousness. If you kill poultry by bleeding, you must leave them to bleed out for at least: 2 minutes - turkeys and geese 90 seconds - all other birds You must wait until the birds are dead before you do anything else to them, including scalding. If you kill poultry with automatic neck cutters make sure that they cut both neck arteries. If they don’t, you must kill the bird straight away by another method."
/government/news/all-dogs-in-england-to-get-free-microchips,"Each year more than 100,000 dogs are dumped or lost at a cost of £57 million to the taxpayer and welfare charities. All dogs in England to get free microchips  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Read our guidance on getting your dog microchipped . (Our guidance was published in February 2016. This press release was published in February 2013 and has not been updated since) All dogs in England will need to be microchipped to help tackle the growing problem of strays roaming the streets, Environment Secretary Owen Paterson announced today. The Government is bringing in compulsory microchipping for all dogs from 6 April 2016 to help reunite owners with lost or stolen pets, relieve the burden on animal charities and local authorities and protect the welfare of dogs by promoting responsible dog ownership. Support from Dogs Trust, the UK’s largest dog welfare charity, means a free microchip will be available for all unchipped dogs in England. Environment Secretary, Owen Paterson, said: It’s a shame that in a nation of dog lovers, thousands of dogs are roaming the streets or stuck in kennels because the owner cannot be tracked down. I am determined to put an end to this and ease the pressure on charities and councils to find new homes for these dogs. Microchipping is a simple solution that gives peace of mind to owners. It makes it easier to get their pet back if it strays and easier to trace if it’s stolen. The generous support of Dogs Trust will mean that this valuable service can be offered for free to pet owners across the country. Currently there are around 8 million pet dogs in the UK. Nearly 60 per cent are already chipped. Owners will be able to get their dog microchipped for free at any of the 18 Dogs Trust centres across the UK, and free microchips will be offered by Dogs Trust to local authorities, housing associations and veterinary surgeries. Battersea Dogs and Cats Home have announced that free microchipping will be offered at their three centres, and the Blue Cross will also offer free microchipping to dogs and cats at their 16 hospitals and centres across England. Clarissa Baldwin, Chief Executive of Dogs Trust, said: We are delighted that the Government has taken this prescient move to introduce compulsory microchipping for all dogs in England. This immediate method of identification is essential to improve dog welfare. This will help to reduce the number of dogs that needlessly end up with an uncertain fate in council pounds and rescue centres when their owners simply cannot be traced. We urge dog owners to view microchipping as part and parcel of dog ownership and, importantly, also take responsibility for keeping their contact details up to date. Kim Hamilton, Blue Cross chief executive, said: Compulsory microchipping will make a huge difference to the work of charities like Blue Cross as we struggle to find homes for an increasing number of stray and unwanted pets. We will be offering both cats and dogs microchipping at Blue Cross rehoming centres and animal hospitals across England. We also welcome plans to allow more flexibility on kennelling suspected banned breeds, as this will have a lasting impression on pet welfare and the wellbeing of dogs. Claire Horton, Chief Executive of Battersea Dogs & Cats Home, said: Battersea warmly welcomes today’s Government announcement on microchipping in England. It’s so worrying for owners when a dog strays from home, yet a tiny microchip the size of a grain of rice means charities like Battersea can often reunite pets with their owners within hours. Having no chip in a dog can mean any reunion can take days to happen, if it happens at all. So our three centres around London will help by offering dog owners free microchipping for their dog. Owen Paterson also announced that the police are being given new powers to tackle dangerous dogs and keep the public safe. The laws on dog attacks will be extended to cover private property, closing a loophole which has meant that dog owners whose animals have attacked people on private property are immune from prosecution. Eight children and six adults have been killed in dog attacks since 2005, with many of these attacks taking place in the home. In the last year alone, over 3,000 postal workers were attacked by dangerously out of control dogs, and 70 per cent of these attacks happened on private property. Householders, however, will be protected from prosecution if their dog attacks a burglar or trespasser on their land. Mr Paterson added: Most people take proper care of their dogs but there are a small minority of people who behave irresponsibly, allowing their dogs to threaten and attack people. People like health and postal workers, who have to go on private property just to do their jobs, deserve protection under the law. By giving the police extra powers to clamp down on law-breakers, those responsible for the worst offences will be held to account regardless of where the attack takes place. Government measures will also allow the police, when dealing with any dogs which are subject to court proceedings under the Dangerous Dogs Act, to decide whether a suspected prohibited dog needs to be kept apart from their owners until the outcome of court proceedings. Previously all such dogs had to be kennelled until after proceedings had concluded, even if they posed no risk to the public. The changes follow a consultation which ran from 23 April 2012 to 15 June 2012. Over 27,000 people responded to the consultation and a breakdown of their responses is available. Notes For more information on how to get your dog microchipped for free, visit our Facebook page at www.facebook.com/Chipmydog For more information on the changes to the law see our dog microchipping policy . From 6 April 2016 all dogs will be required to have a microchip giving owners three years to get their dogs microchipped for free from the Dogs Trust. Battersea Dogs and Cats Home are also offering free microchipping in their three centres. After 6 April 2016, owners of dogs found by the police or local authorities not to have a microchip will have the benefits explained to them and be given a short period to comply with the microchipping law. If they do not, they will face a fine of up to £500. 110,000 stray dogs are picked up by police, local authorities and animal welfare charities each year. Over half (52%) of these stray dogs could not be rehomed because their owner could not be identified. 6,000 dogs are put down each year because their owner is unknown and they cannot be rehomed.

/guidance/set-up-a-commons-council,"How to set up a commons council to manage common land. Set up a commons council Land management Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Natural England Common land is land owned by one or more persons where other people, known as commoners, are entitled to use the land or take resources from it. Commons councils are statutory groups (groups established by law) which manage and protect common land. In most cases, you won’t need to set up a commons council - you can manage common land by setting up a voluntary group . Voluntary groups have no legal powers, whereas a commons council can make legally binding rules about how people use the land it’s responsible for. These legally binding rules can help if commoners, landowners and other stakeholders can’t agree about how to manage the land. What commons councils do A commons council can manage one area of land or several different areas. They’re run by council members who are appointed or elected by people who have an interest in the land, eg commoners or landowners. Commons council members vote to decide how to run the common land they’re responsible for and can make legally binding rules that control: agriculture and vegetation on the land how commoners exercise their rights of common on the land - eg which months they can have animals grazing and how many animals can graze leasing, licensing and transfer of rights of common - eg the council can temporarily take control of unused rights of common and transfer them to someone else Commons councils can also: set up a grazing register to keep track of how many animals are on the common and who owns them set up and maintain boundaries, eg walls, fences or cattle grids - find out more about carrying out works on common land remove any unlawful boundaries remove animals that are grazing illegally - ie their owner doesn’t have a right of common on the land buy rights of common from existing commoners Rules commons councils can’t make Commons councils can’t make rules that: override the normal need for landowners’ consent for any activities that aren’t rights of common would regulate anything that’s already illegal, eg using motor vehicles on common land Before you apply You need to decide what role you want the council to have and discuss your proposal with local people. The Department for the Environment and Rural Affairs (Defra) won’t consider your proposal if you haven’t got substantial support for it. Develop your proposal – you’ll need to decide what powers and functions you want the council to have. Hold a consultation to tell people in the area about your proposal – how you do this is up to you. Organise a vote – you need a large majority of voters to support your plan to create a council. You can use the following example orders to help you develop your proposal and explain to other people what powers and functions the council would have: [InlineAttachment:1] [InlineAttachment:2] Apply to set up a commons council Your proposal should explain why you want to set up the commons council. You’ll need to provide details of: the common including location, size, topographical information and map any unique or rare features, including flora, fauna, archaeology the number of rights holders and the rights they hold the owners and other land managers (eg National Park Authority) whether the land is subject to any agri-environment agreements whether the land is subject to any type of land designation (eg Site of Special Scientific Interest, Less Favoured Area, National Park) whether the land is subject to any statutory regulation (eg scheme of management, scheme of regulation under the Commons Act 1899 or an order of regulation under the Commons Act 1876 or regulation under the Commons Act 1908) the current management structure (eg association, Board of Conservators), including number of active and inactive graziers any current management problems (eg over-stocking, fly ponies) whether a live register exists - a live register records the current active and inactive grazing on the commons which isn’t the same as the register held by the commons registration authority who you consulted - this should include commoners, landowners and any others with a legal interest, plus any organisations the council will deal with, eg National Park Authority, Natural England what questions you asked in your consultation, and what answers you got the result of the last vote you held - you don’t need to give results from any earlier rounds of voting Information on your proposed council You need to provide the following details: who’ll be part of your common council, including the number of people representing each of the main interests, eg active graziers, non-graziers and landowners an explanation of the public benefits of setting up a commons council what functions and powers you want the commons council to have how you’ll finance the running of the commons council a description of the relationship between your proposed council and existing management arrangements on the common you want it to manage Liaison person details You must also include the names of the people who will be the: liaison person for your proposed council - and proof that there’s enough funding for their work returning officer and oversee your first elections Send your proposal Email commons.villagegreens@defra.gsi.gov.uk or send your proposal for seeking an establishment order to: Commons, Access and Inland Waterways Team Defra Nobel House, 1E 17 Smith Square London SW1P 3JR After you apply The Secretary of State will: review your proposal and any rules you want to make and consider whether to make an establishment order to create your commons council if relevant, they’ll publish the draft establishment order on citizen space , a website used by government bodies to seek citizens’ views Anyone can respond to a draft order but the Secretary of State will particularly consider responses from people who have a legal interest in the land, including commoners or landowners. In rare cases, the Secretary of State may also hold a public inquiry, for example if there’s major opposition to a draft order. Establishment orders The establishment order made by the Secretary of State will set out out how you must run your commons council. It’ll state: who’s eligible to become a participant the size and constitution of the council the term of office that council members will hold - the maximum is 4 years how council members can resign or renew membership and how to fill vacancies- eg with by-elections how you must appoint a chairperson, secretary, treasurer or other officers how to call meetings and whether they should be public or have a public agenda how to make, amend or revoke standing orders - eg where you meet and how often how to appoint committees or individuals to carry out council functions Funding your commons council Your commons council can raise the money it needs to operate by: charging participants a subscription fee applying for funding, eg from the Heritage Lottery , the EU or other sources Electing council members Your establishment order will set out the categories of voter in your commons council, for example: active graziers - people exercising animal grazing rights on the common other commoners - people who have a right to graze but choose not to or whose right is not to do with grazing landowners Each category elects or appoints people to represent them. For example, active graziers and other commoners vote for their own representatives and can’t vote in any other category, while landowners usually appoint their representative. Returning officer A returning officer will arrange your first election and appointments. For all subsequent elections, you must appoint your own returning officer. Participants The returning officer will make a list of people who can vote to elect council members - in commons councils these people are known as participants. A participant is one of the following: a commoner a landowner or tenant anyone else with a legal interest in the land the council is responsible for, eg a club with sporting rights Appointing non-voting council members Establishment orders can allow commons councils to appoint non-voting members, eg to make sure an interest is represented or to add an expert to the council. These experts are known as co-optees. Appointing committees Commons councils can appoint committees to carry out council functions. Employing staff A commons council can employ staff to carry out any of its functions, eg people who enforce grazing rules on the land, known as ‘reeves’. Delegating work Your commons council can only hire contractors or other groups to do tasks that help the council to fulfil its main functions. You can’t delegate all the duties of the commons council to a contractor or another group. Making decisions You must hold a vote to make any decisions about running the common. Each commons council member gets one vote. If a vote is tied, the chairperson gets a second vote to decide the matter. Your council can decide how many council members must be present for a valid vote to take place. Some decisions need a two-thirds majority to be carried, eg making or changing rules - your establishment order will state which type of decisions need this majority. Proxy voting Your chairperson can decide whether to allow absent members to nominate someone else to vote for them, and how this process should work. Making rules All commons council rules must be approved by the Secretary of State. Your commons council must publish any draft rules on its website and invite comments before you send them to the Secretary of State. When you’ve done this, email commons.villagegreens@defra.gsi.gov.uk the details of the proposed new rule and any comments you’ve received, or post them to: Commons, Access and Inland Waterways Team Defra Nobel House, 1E 17 Smith Square London SW1P 3JR Publicising approved rules If the Secretary of State approves your rule, you must send a copy of the rule to the following groups 14 days before it comes into force: the local authority any commoners or their associations, parish councils or National Park authorities who the rule will affect You must also publish details of new rules on your website, and give written notice to anyone else who’ll be affected by them, eg landowners. Enforcement If anyone breaks the rules set by your commons council, you can apply to the county court for a court order requiring someone to comply. If your commons council has made it a criminal offence to break a rule, and this has been approved by the Secretary of State, you can prosecute offenders at a magistrates’ court. Removing rules Your commons council can remove any rule if council members vote to do so with a two-thirds majority. The council must then send written notice to the following groups, 14 days before the rule ceases to exist: the Secretary of State the local authority any parish council or National Park authority in the same area as the common the commoners You must also publicise that you’ve removed the rule, eg by announcing it on your website. The Secretary of State can send your commons council a direction that means you must remove a rule - the direction will explain the reasons. This happens rarely, and usually only in cases where new national legislation duplicates a rule. Changing establishment orders If you want to change the terms of your common’s council’s establishment order, you can contact the Secretary of State and ask them to issue a variation order. You’ll need to show there’s substantial support for the changes you want to make from the participants in your council, or that they’re essential for the commons council to function. The Secretary of State will publish details of the proposed variation order and invite public representations. Annual general meetings Your commons council must have an annual general meeting within 6 months of the end of each financial year. You must tell all council participants about the meeting. You can hold as many other meetings as you choose. All commons council meetings must be open to the public. However, you can exclude the public for an agenda item if your council has voted to pass a resolution that deems that item confidential. The council must present a financial report, a balance sheet and a statement of income and expenditure at each annual general meeting. Publishing minutes You must publish the minutes and agenda of your meetings on a commons council website. You can exclude items if the council has passed a resolution deeming them confidential. Keeping accounts All commons councils must keep accounts. You must have your council accounts independently examined if the gross annual income of your council is more than £10,000. If the gross annual income is £250,000 or more, the person you hire to examine your accounts must be a member of one of the following bodies: Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland Association of Chartered Certified Accountants Association of Authorised Public Accountants Association of Accounting Technicians Association of International Accountants Chartered Institute of Management Accountants Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy You must show any member of the public your commons council’s accounts for the last 3 financial years if they ask to see them. Closing a commons council The Secretary of State can close a commons council as a last resort, if after consulting the council, they decide that it meets any of the following conditions: it has ceased to operate it has stopped fulfilling its function of managing and protecting the common it isn’t showing enough regard to the public interest To do this, the Secretary of State will make a revocation order. They’ll talk to your council to decide if enough council members support the winding up of the council Insolvency If a commons council can’t afford to pay its creditors, the Secretary of State can close it down and transfer its assets to another body. If the council members don’t support closing the council, any assets it has, including future income, will be sold to pay creditors. The commons council itself is liable for any debt it incurs, unless individual members make themselves personally responsible to a bank or other lender."
/guidance/carrier-bag-charges-retailers-responsibilities,"Find out when you must charge at least 5p for plastic carrier bags, bags you're not required to charge for and the records you must keep. Carrier bag charges: retailers' responsibilities  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs You must charge at least 5p for single-use carrier bags in England from 5 October 2015 if you’re a large retailer. Read why there is now a charge for carrier bags If you’re a large retailer you must charge at least 5p for single-use carrier bags. If you’re a small or medium-sized business you can charge and follow the scheme voluntarily - you don’t have to report or keep records for carrier bag use. Work out if you count as a large retailer . You must charge if you: sell goods in England deliver goods to England As a retailer: the charge is for non-reusable bags (single-use bags) you must charge for bags used for collections and deliveries you don’t need to charge an extra 5p if you’re already charging 5p or more for bags Bags you charge for You must charge at least 5p a bag (including VAT) for carrier bags that are all of the following: unused - it’s new and hasn’t already been used for sold goods to be taken away or delivered plastic and 70 microns thick or less it has handles, an opening and isn’t sealed Monitor self checkouts You must do all you can to make sure that you charge for bags at self checkouts. For example, the checkouts ask shoppers how many bags they used and charges for them. Charging for deliveries and click-and-collect bags You must charge for plastic bags used for deliveries and online sales, including click-and-collect (and similar) collections. The number of bags used isn’t always known until delivery takes place. This means you can charge for an average number of bags for multi-bag deliveries, as long as 5p or more is charged per bag overall. You can also offer bagless delivery as an option - this will cut down on waste and Defra encourages you to do this. Bags you’re not required to to charge for Some bags are exempt - you don’t have to charge for these, but can if you want to. You don’t have to charge if the bag only contains certain items, but if you add other items then you must charge. For example, you’re not required to charge for a bag containing an unwrapped blade and unwrapped loose seeds. But if you add a box of cornflakes then you would have to charge. Returnable bags and bags for life You’re not required to apply the 5p charge for: woven plastic bags multiple reuse bags (bags for life), when replaced, if originally sold for 5p or more You can still charge for these bags but you don’t need to record sales and proceeds as you do with single-use carrier bags. A returnable multiple reuse bag must be all of the following: sold for 5p or more suitable for reuse replaced free of charge if returned to you when worn out Food and plants You’re not required to charge for plastic bags that are for: uncooked fish and fish products uncooked meat, poultry and their products unwrapped food for animal or human consumption - eg chips, or food in containers that aren’t secure enough to prevent leakage during handling unwrapped loose seeds flowers bulbs, corms or rhizomes (roots, stems and shoots, such as ginger). goods contaminated by soil (like potatoes or plants) Products You’re not required to charge for bags: for unwrapped blades, including axes, knives, and knife and razor blades for prescription medicine used for a service, but there is no sale of goods, eg dry cleaning Live fish and aquatic creatures You’re not required to charge for bags holding live fish or other aquatic creatures. Packaging, transport and promotions You’re not required to charge for bags: for goods in transport, such as at an airport or on a train, plane or ship considered as sealed packaging for mail order and click-and-collect orders used to give away free promotional material When you must charge You must charge if you employ 250 or more full-time equivalent employees (in total and not just in retail roles) in a year. You’re not required to charge if you have less than 250 full-time equivalent employees, although you can do so voluntarily. Reporting year You work out how many full-time equivalent employees you have at the start of each reporting year. The reporting year runs from: 5 October 2015 to 6 April 2016 7 April to 6 April from 2016 onwards Work out your number of employees On the first day of the reporting year calculate how many full-time equivalent employees you have: Work out how many hours a full-time employee would work in a year (eg 40 hours by 52 weeks is 2,080). Multiply this by the amount of full-time workers there for the full year (eg 200 workers by 2,080 is 416,000). Work out part-time and seasonal workers’ hours by multiplying their weekly hours by the weeks worked (eg 100 workers by 20 hours by 10 weeks, added to 100 workers by 40 hours by  25 weeks is 20,00 plus 100,000, giving 120,000). Add the full-time and part-time or seasonal workers’ hours together (eg 416,000 plus 120,000 is 536,000). Divide this by the amount of hours a full-time employee would work in a year (eg 536,000 divided by 2,080 is 257.7). If this number is 250 or more then you must charge for bags. Franchises and symbol groups If your store is part of a franchise or symbol group (an independent retailer that shares a brand-name shop and products) you only count employees in your business. You don’t count the franchise or symbol group as a whole. For example if you’re part of a symbol group and you own: 10 stores in a symbol group and have more than 250 employees in total - you must charge 2 stores with 15 employees - you don’t have to charge Keeping records You must keep a reporting year’s records for 3 years from 31 May in the following reporting year. For example, you must keep the records for 5 October 2015 to 6 April 2016 until 31 May 2019. You must record for the whole reporting year: the number of single-use carrier bags you supplied the gross and net proceeds of the charge any VAT in the gross proceeds what you did with the proceeds from the charge any reasonable costs and how they break down Send records to Defra You must submit your records on the dedicated reporting website on or before 31 May following the end of the reporting year. For example, for the period 5 October 2015 to 6 April 2016 you must record your details on the website by 31 May 2016. This information will be made public. You must send your name and email to PlasticBagCharge@defra.gsi.gov.uk . If you send your name and email before 31 March 2016 you’ll be sent a link unique to your company on 7 April 2016 to the reporting website. You’ll get an email with the link from defra.htkhorizon.com and not a gov.uk address. If you don’t send your name and email by 23 May 2016 you may not get the reporting link in time for 31 May. If you miss the 23 May deadline you should still send your details to Defra. Reasonable costs Reasonable costs include new costs you incurred by following the law on charging. This might include: the cost of changing till systems training staff communicating the policy to staff and customers getting expert advice administering donations to good causes You can’t include existing costs, such as the cost of the bags. Trading across different regions If you trade across different regions of the UK, you can apply for a Primary Authority agreement . You can then choose to deal with just one local authority rather than the authorities in each area you trade in. Replying to public enquiries Members of the public can ask you for copies of your carrier bag records. You must give them copies within 28 days. Dealing with the proceeds Once you’ve deducted reasonable costs, it’s expected that you’ll donate all proceeds to good causes, particularly environmental causes. You can see how Carrier Bag Charges Wales : benefits good causes reduces carrier bag waste Getting inspected Your local authority inspects you to check you are following the law. Inspectors can: visit your shop or store make test purchases speak to staff demand records Inspectors don’t have to give you warning but can carry these out as ‘secret shopper’ exercises. If they find a problem they can: issue a non-compliance notice stating what you must do to fix the problem impose a fixed penalty impose a variable penalty order you to publicise (eg adverts in local papers or posters in your store) that you’ve broken the law, what your penalty was and how you’re now complying Inspectors can order you to cover the cost of the investigation if you break the law. How much you can be fined Your local authority must publish details of fine levels, and when it will impose them, on its website. You can’t receive a variable fine if you’ve already received a fixed fine for the same problem, unless you’ve received a non-compliance notice for the problem. Fixed penalties Problem Penalty Not charging for bags appropriately £200 Not keeping records £100 Not supplying records £100 Variable penalties Problem Maximum penalty Not charging for bags appropriately £5,000 Not keeping records £5,000 Not supplying records £5,000 Giving false or misleading information to, or otherwise obstructing or failing to assist the local authority £20,000 Paying fines on time Fines are: reduced by 50% if you pay within 28 days increased by 50% if you fail to pay within 56 days Appeals and objections You can object within 28 days of you receiving a fine, the fine or letter will tell you how to do so. You can appeal a penalty if you feel your fine was wrong, unreasonable or based on an error. You can also appeal if you feel that your non-monetary requirement is unreasonable, or if the variable amount penalty is too high.

/government/news/stop-the-spread-for-invasive-species-week,"The second annual Invasive Species Week starts on 29 February and will run until 6 March. Stop the spread for Invasive Species Week  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Gardeners, birdwatchers, sportspeople and recreational anglers are being called on to help protect the UK from the threat of invasive non-native species, Minister for Biosecurity Lord Gardiner announced today as he launched Invasive Species Week. INNS cost the British economy £1.7 billion a year. To help stop INNS arriving and spreading, Defra and the GB Non-native Species Secretariat are holding a special week to raise awareness of the issue. It will bring together organisations from across Britain who can help stop INNS damaging our landscapes and harming our native wildlife. While the majority of animals and plants introduced to Britain are harmless, around 10-15% become ‘invasive’. Lord Gardiner will be visiting Walthamstow Reservoirs, one of Thames Water’s key recreational sites, which boasts a rich bird habitat with a number of Sites of Special Scientific Interest making up the ten individual reservoirs. It offers activities such as angling, sailing, windsurfing and bird watching. The Minister will see how they work with users to promote biosecurity measures. Speaking ahead of his visit Lord Gardiner said: Our country has some of the most precious wildlife and beautiful landscapes in the world, but by clogging pipes, overpowering plants and disturbing ecosystems, invasive non-native species can pose a risk to animal, plant and even human health. By checking and cleaning our water sport equipment after use and making sure garden plants do not escape into the wild, we can all help stop the spread of invasive non-native species. I hope people use this week to learn more about the simple steps they can take to protect our natural environment. This year Invasive Species Week coincides with the fifth anniversary of Check, Clean, Dry – a campaign launched by Defra and the Welsh and Scottish Governments in March 2011. The campaign is supported by the Angling Trust and Royal Yachting Association, to provide simple biosecurity advice for recreational water users, particularly anglers, and boat and kayak users. The campaign was launched after the success of Be Plant Wise, a campaign run with the support of the Ornamental and Aquatic Trade Association and the Horticultural Trade Association. The initiative keeps gardeners and pond owners informed of the dangers caused by invasive aquatic plants and to reduce the risk of them dumping aquatic plants in the wild. Niall Moore, Chief Non-native Species Officer and Head of the GB Non-native Species Secretariat, said: Invasive non-native species are one of the key threats to our wildlife and natural environment, and can be extremely costly and difficult to manage if allowed to establish. Help to prevent this from happening by getting involved and spreading the message during Invasive Species Week. Stuart Smith, Head of Water Production at Thames Water, said: We have a lot of experience in dealing with invasive species, which can harm boats, water pipes and whole ecosystems, and are fully behind the campaign. While there is no threat to the quality of the water we supply to our customers, we rely on the help and support of boaters, anglers and other users in protecting all our waters.

/government/news/environment-agency-unveils-new-rod-licence-images,"The Environment Agency today (Tuesday 1 March) unveils its new design for this year’s rod licences.  Environment Agency unveils new rod licence images  Environment Agency Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Designed by renowned angling and wildlife artist, David Miller, the new rod licences go on sale today. The image on this year’s non-migratory trout and coarse fishing rod licence is a chub (Leuciscus cephalus). The salmon and sea trout licence is a sea trout (Salmo trutta). David’s artwork has previously featured on a range of sustainable fish stamps for the Royal Mail. Sarah Chare, head of fisheries at the Environment Agency, said: All the money raised from rod licence sales is used to protect and improve fish stocks and fisheries benefiting anglers. We want more people to give fishing a go and everyone who does will need one of these licences. We’re delighted to see David’s stunning designs which promote the beauty of our natural environment and encourage people to give fishing a go. David Miller, the artist who designed the new rod licences, said: Designing this year’s rod licence combines two of my passions: fishing and art. The Environment Agency does a fantastic job and I’m proud to be supporting rod licence sales with my artwork. A rod licence is a legal requirement for fishing. At £27 for coarse fishing and non-migratory trout, or £72 to also fish for salmon and sea trout, the annual licence is great value for money. There are flexible options to choose from too: a 1 or 8 day licence or the full season. There are also junior and concession options. You can buy your rod licence online from the Post Office here, at your local Post Office or by phoning 0344 800 5386. Buying a rod licence online from the Post Office website is easy , and saves both time and administration costs, meaning that more of the income can be spent on improving fish stocks and fishing. Always ensure that you buy direct from the Post Office because there are some unofficial websites which charge a handling fee. Anyone fishing illegally is cheating other licence paying anglers, can expect to be prosecuted and face a substantial fine. In 2014-2015 the Environment Agency checked 70,000 rod licences and prosecuted more than 2,000 anglers for fishing without a licence resulting in more than £500,000 in fines and costs. Rod licence prices and structure remain the same in 2016. Any proposed changes will come in from March 2017."
/government/news/one-month-left-to-chip-your-dog,"From 6 April it will be compulsory for owners to ensure their dog is microchipped  One month left to chip your dog  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Every year over 102,000 dogs are picked up from our streets having strayed or been stolen, but thanks to new microchipping laws coming into effect on 6 April they’ll soon stand a much greater chance of being returned home safe and sound to their owners. Already 83% of responsible dog owners have had their four-legged friend painlessly implanted with a microchip and their details updated on a national database. This means should one of our 8.5 million dogs take itself for ‘walkies’ we can quickly find out where they’ve come from and reunite them with their family. The new rules which come into force in England next month will not only protect the welfare of dogs and promote responsible ownership, but also make it easier to track down the owners of dogs that carry out attacks on people. We also expect local authorities and charities, which would otherwise feed, kennel and home dogs, to make £33 million in annual savings were these dogs microchipped and returned to owners. Commenting on the new law Animal Welfare Minister George Eustice said: We are a nation of dog lovers and we want to make sure they stay safe. Microchipping our dogs will not only reunite people with their lost or stolen pets, but also help to tackle the growing problem of strays roaming the streets and relieve the burden placed on animal charities and local authorities. Microchipping is vital for good dog welfare and a simple solution for responsible pet owners to provide peace of mind and ensure your much-loved dog can be traced. Providing support for compulsory microchipping, Paula Boyden, Dogs Trust Veterinary Director added: Dogs Trust welcomes the new legalisation coming into effect on 6 April as we have long campaigned to make microchipping compulsory. Losing a dog is an extremely upsetting time for both dog and dog owner and microchipping increases the likelihood that a dog will be reunited with their owner in the event they are lost, making it an essential part of animal welfare law in England. It is vital that the microchip details are kept up to date. In 2015, 47,596 unclaimed and unwanted dogs were left in council kennels across the UK as these dogs could not be reunited with their owners. Stray dogs that find themselves at Dogs Trust are the lucky ones, as we will care for a dog for its entire life if needed. In 2015 alone Dogs Trust has microchipped over 185,000 dogs for free across our network of Rehoming Centres and we’re still working tirelessly to ensure even more dogs are given these small but essential pieces of technology before April. Currently, at Dogs Trust there are 1,546 stray, unwanted and abandoned dogs looking for their forever home. The soon-to-be-compulsory procedure is inexpensive and ranges from £10-£30, with many charities and animal shelters offering to carry it out for free. Additional information After 6 April 2016, owners of dogs found by the police or local authorities not to have a microchip will have the benefits explained to them and be given a short period to comply with the microchipping law. If they do not, they could face a fine of up to £500.

/guidance/flood-and-sea-defences-designated-assets-on-your-land,"What happens if a structure or feature on your land is designated as a flood or coastal erosion defence asset. Flood and sea defences: designated assets on your land  Environment Agency Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs If you have a structure or feature on your land that helps manage the risk of flooding or coastal erosion, it can be designated as a flood risk management asset. Assets can be any natural or man-made structure or feature, such as walls, buildings, earth embankments, shingle banks, or raised areas of land. Your structure or feature can be designated by the risk management authorities: Environment Agency Natural Resources Wales lead local flood authorities district councils internal drainage boards What designation means You can continue to use and maintain the structure or feature after it’s been designated. However, you usually must get consent from the responsible authority if you want to alter, remove or replace it. The designated structure or feature will be registered as a ‘local land charge’. This means that the designation is attached to the land and is legally binding on successive owners or occupiers. How assets are designated You’ll be sent a ‘provisional designation notice’ by the authority that wants to designate the potential asset. The notice will: identify the structure or feature to be designated ask you to confirm you’re the owner or that you maintain it tell you which authority intends to designate it explain the reasons for the designation including why the potential asset affects flood or coastal erosion risk explain the legal process and implications tell you how to raise any queries or concerns you may have You’ll have at least 28 days to raise any concerns or questions. These will be considered before a final decision is made. You should not alter, remove or replace the proposed asset during the notice period without consent from the authority. You’ll be sent a confirmation notice if the decision is made to designate the structure. The authority that designates the asset then becomes known as the responsible authority. You can appeal a decision to designate a structure or feature . Alter, remove or replace a designated asset You may need consent from the responsible authority if you want to alter, remove or replace a designated asset. There are no set rules for what you can and can’t do without consent. You’ll usually only need it if what you want to do will affect flood or coastal erosion risk. For example, routine maintenance on a wall doesn’t usually need consent, but raising or lowering its height probably will. Sometimes a designation notice is issued with a general consent included, to permit you to do certain things. Check with the responsible authority if you’re not sure if you need consent. How to apply Apply to the Environment Agency for consent if they’re the responsible authority. If you’re not sure who the responsible authority is contact your local council . You should get a response within 2 months of sending your request. Contact the responsible authority if you don’t get a response in this time. You can appeal to the tribunal if you: are refused consent don’t want to abide by the conditions imposed on the consent don’t agree with an enforcement notice If you alter, remove or replace an asset without consent You may face legal action if you alter, remove or replace a designated asset without consent. You’ll be sent an enforcement notice asking you to reinstate the asset. You can be prosecuted and fined if you don’t comply with the enforcement notice. The authority can also carry out emergency works and recover the costs from you. Request that a designation is cancelled Contact the responsible authority if you want to have a designation cancelled. You should get a response within 2 months. Contact them again if you don’t. You can appeal if the authority refuses to cancel . If the responsible authority cancels a designation The responsible authority is only likely to cancel a designation if the designation is no longer necessary or appropriate, eg when a wall has been replaced by an alternative purpose-built flood or coastal erosion defence. How to appeal You may be able to appeal to the General Regulatory Chamber of the First-tier Tribunal (Environment) against a decision made by a designating authority. If you’re the owner of a designated structure or feature you can appeal if you: disagree with a decision to designate your structure or feature are refused consent, eg to alter, remove or replace it don’t agree with a decision in connection with a consent application, eg conditions imposed on it don’t agree with an enforcement notice have applied to have the designation cancelled and been refused If you’re not the owner, you can only appeal if you carried out work that resulted in an enforcement notice. Send your appeal to the tribunal so it’s received within 28 days of the formal notice being sent by the authority. A late application will only be accepted if you have a good reason for the delay. The designation will remain in place until the tribunal makes its decision. If you’re appealing an enforcement notice, you don’t have to abide by it until the tribunal makes its decision. If you don’t get a response from the responsible authority Contact the designating authority if they have not responded to your objection within 2 months. If they tell you they’ve rejected your objection you can appeal to the tribunal. You can’t appeal to the tribunal if the authority just hasn’t given you a decision yet - eg due to an administrative error. You’ll need to raise a complaint with the authority instead. You must appeal to the tribunal within 28 days of the end of the 2 month period. Alternatives to a tribunal You may be able to avoid going to a tribunal. Check with the authority to see if they have any form of alternative dispute resolution. The 28 day deadline to appeal will still apply so you may want to send your notice of appeal to the tribunal first. Contact the Environment Agency [Contact:144]"

Compulsory dog microchipping comes into effect  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Lost or stray dogs will be reunited with their owners thanks to new microchipping laws which come into effect to improve dog welfare today. Under the new measures all owners must ensure their dog is microchipped and their details are kept up to date. Not only will this mean the UK’s 8.5 million dogs can be returned to their owners more quickly if they wander too far from home, but it will also make it easier to track down the owners of dogs that carry out attacks on people. Already over 86% of responsible dog owners have had their pets painlessly implanted with a microchip and their details updated on a national database.

/guidance/great-crested-newts-surveys-and-mitigation-for-development-projects,"Standing advice for local planning authorities who need to assess the impacts of development on great crested newts. Great crested newts: surveys and mitigation for development projects Protected sites and species Wildlife and habitat conservation Natural England Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Survey reports and mitigation plans are required for development projects that could affect protected species, as part of getting planning permission or a mitigation licence. Surveys need to show whether protected species are present in the area or nearby, and how they use the site. Mitigation plans show how you’ll avoid, reduce or manage any negative effects to protected species. This is Natural England’s species standing advice for local planning authorities who need to assess planning applications that affect great crested newts. This information should be used to decide what is needed for surveys and planning mitigation measures for great crested newts. Ecologists need to decide which survey and mitigation methods are right for the project they’re working on. If this standing advice isn’t followed, they’ll have to include a statement with the planning application explaining why. Where this guide says ‘you’ it means the ecologist. Get more detail on: penalties, what not to do and when you might need a licence great crested newt mitigation licence forms construction near protected wildlife (for developers) how planning authorities can assess applications involving protected wildlife Decide if you need to survey Survey for great crested newts if: distribution and historical records suggest newts may be present there’s a pond within 500 metres of the development, even if it only holds water some of the year the development site includes refuges (eg log piles or rubble), grassland, scrub, woodland or hedgerows Great crested newts may be present even if: the site has been ploughed, soil stripped or had ponds filled in within the last 4 years the breeding pond was destroyed several years ago the pond is muddy, heavily shaded or vegetated the pond contains fish the pond is temporary You may be able to exclude areas from the survey if: the newts are highly unlikely to be present, eg because the habitat is unsuitable or records show no newts nearby the planned activity or development wouldn’t affect the newt population, eg because the newts are separated from harmful activities by a barrier the newts can’t cross Habitat suitability index Use the habitat suitability index ( HSI ) to calculate habitat quality and likelihood of great crested newt presence. HSI is not a replacement for detailed survey and cannot confirm presence or absence. Survey effort required You’ll need to decide exactly how many survey visits to make according to the survey objective and local conditions. You may be asked for more surveys if your planning application is based on poor data, unless you can show the area is of low importance to newts. For presence/absence surveys, you only need to complete the full recommended number of visits if you don’t find evidence of newts during early visits. When to survey The times in the following table are based on typical newt activity in central England lowland. Adjust your survey timings according to your location and local weather conditions. Survey method Best time to survey Environmental DNA mid-April to late June Egg search April to June Pitfall traps March, April, May and September Refuge search April to September Bottle or funnel traps March to May Netting mid-March to mid-June (August to find larvae) Torch survey mid-March to mid-June (August to find larvae) You’re unlikely to detect any eggs or larvae between November and January. Survey methods Acceptable methods for surveying great crested newts are: environmental DNA ( eDNA ) bottle or funnel trapping egg search torch survey - this isn’t recommended for turbid ponds netting - this should only be used in addition to other methods and not to indicate population size pitfall traps refuge search - it’s best not to rely on this technique alone Presence/absence surveys of ponds You should: use 3 methods per visit (preferably torch survey, bottle trapping and egg searching) make at least 4 visits if you can’t establish presence on the first visit visit between mid-March and mid-June with at least 2 visits in peak season (usually mid-April to mid-May) Presence/absence surveys on land For this method: use pitfall trapping with drift fencing (and refuges if possible) trap on at least 60 nights in suitable weather conditions (above 5°C, no high winds or heavy rain) visit between March and October This method is less reliable than surveying ponds. Population size class assessments in ponds For this method: use torch surveys and bottle trapping on each visit make at least 6 visits (if you found newts during the first 4 presence/absence visits) visit between mid-March and mid-June with at least 3 visits in peak season (usually mid-April to mid-May) Survey adult newts in spring to estimate whether the population is small, medium or large. You can combine results from multiple ponds if the newts regularly move between them, but only for counts you got on the same visit. Provide the following results: maximum adult count per pond per night peak counts per pond overall total site count Then class populations as: small - maximum counts up to 10 medium - maximum counts between 11 and 100 large - maximum counts over 100 Environmental DNA surveys You can use eDNA surveys to find out if newts are present and whether to conduct population size class surveys on ponds and other waterbodies. Make one visit in the daytime, during the period when the newts are likely to be present (this depends on location and conditions like the weather). Natural England will only accept eDNA survey results from samples collected between 15 April and 30 June each year. Follow the methods in the technical report that accompanies Defra’s research project into eDNA , and use quantitative polymerase chain reaction testing. Provide evidence with your planning application and licence application that: a licensed great crested newt surveyor collected the eDNA sample a suitably equipped laboratory undertook the laboratory work in strict adherence to the methods in the technical report above shows all ponds on maps, including those ponds that were sampled for eDNA Include the following as a separate document with your licence application: which waterbodies you tested the dates when you took the water samples a table showing the results a declaration that you’ve followed the methods in the technical report Keep the records from the survey for at least 12 months after the first licence return. Influences on survey results Mention and explain the implications in both your ecological survey and your licence application if any of these factors affect your survey counts: weather water turbidity density of aquatic vegetation disturbance torch power surveyor’s experience position of drift fence or pitfall traps on the site Assess the impacts Provide an assessment of the impacts this development will have on great crested newts before, during and after the planned work. Include qualitative and quantitative information with your planning application. Use these factors to assess the site’s importance, and submit this with your planning application: the number and size of newt populations the nature of the habitats and population, eg whether it includes a breeding site how significant the site is to the local population and the wider status of great crested newts Before development Things that can affect great crested newts, eg injure or kill them as well as lead to loss of habitat before development work begins include: site clearance topsoiling regrading and drainage work archaeological excavation (this can also create new waterbodies for the newts to colonise) During development Construction work can destroy habitats and kill newts. It can also create temporary habitats, like piles of rubble. Long-term impacts Habitat loss or fragmentation is the most common long-term impact of development. Major habitat loss can cause: reduced breeding and recruitment, eg fewer young, maturing and adults joining the breeding population leading to fewer breeding adults. fewer foraging opportunities fewer refuges, leading to exposure to predators or harsh conditions unsuccessful hibernation population fragmentation Other long-term impacts include: changing habitats, eg by tidying up semi-natural habitats for recreational or aesthetic reasons habitat fragmentation and isolation, eg creating physical barriers that newts can’t cross the effects of introducing fish to breeding ponds, or invasive plants like Crassula helmsii the effects of more people using the area, eg to dump rubbish changes to the water table increased siltation increased shading increased chemical run-off less prey You will need mitigation measures to reduce the negative effects. Scale of impacts Use the following tables to assess the scale of impacts on the newt populations. Mitigation measures are needed even for low impacts. Effect on breeding ponds Impact Destruction High Isolation caused by fragmentation High Partial destruction or modification Medium Temporary disturbance Low Post-development interference High Effect on other ponds newts use Impact Destruction Medium Isolation caused by fragmentation Medium Partial destruction or modification Low Temporary disturbance Low Post-development interference Low Effect on terrestrial habitat less than 50 metres from breeding pond Impact Destruction High Isolation caused by fragmentation High Partial destruction Medium Modified management, resurfacing etc Medium Temporary disturbance Low Post-development interference Medium Temporary destruction and reinstatement Low Effect on terrestrial habitat 50 to 250 metres from breeding pond Impact Destruction Medium Isolation caused by fragmentation Medium Partial destruction Low Modified management, resurfacing etc Low Temporary disturbance Low Post-development interference Low Temporary destruction and reinstatement Low Effect on terrestrial habitat more than 250 metres from breeding pond Impact Destruction Low Isolation caused by fragmentation Low Partial destruction Low Modified management, resurfacing etc Low Temporary disturbance Low Post-development interference Low Temporary destruction and reinstatement Low Mitigation and compensation methods Assess how the development will affect newt populations in neighbouring plots even if they’re owned by someone else. This might involve additional surveys. You’ll need to submit a masterplan if the neighbouring plots have been or are likely to be developed. Find out more about masterplans and other requirements for mitigation licence applications . Address the potential impacts you’ve identified on great crested newts by creating mitigation plans. First, aim to avoid negative effects, eg by redesigning the scheme. If this isn’t possible, mitigate and compensate by: excluding and relocating the newts on a small scale creating, restoring or improving habitats on the site or next to it If you predict a major, unavoidable impact on the newts, translocate (capture and move) them away from the site less than 1 km away to an area with the same or better habitats. You’ll need to compensate for destroyed habitat as well. Follow the approaches in this guide for your chosen mitigation or compensation methods. Justify in your planning application if you need to use different techniques or levels of effort for the site. Roads and other hard surfaces Include with your planning or licence application an assessment of impacts caused by hard surfaces such as: roads car parks buildings Avoid habitat fragmentation, for example by: creating corridors or ‘stepping stones’ of habitat to join up populations altering road routes installing ‘green bridges’ or underpasses creating new breeding and terrestrial habitats on one side of the road Design new habitats to avoid trapping newts, for example by: using sloping kerbs either side of gully pots creating draining schemes without sumps not using kerbs Position mitigation ponds away from busy roads - use permanent amphibian fencing if that’s not possible. Only use tunnels or culverts to help the newts reach habitat across a road if: there’s no alternative way to maintain dispersal routes there’s a fencing system to channel the newts in - this will need regular maintenance you monitor the tunnel’s effectiveness Capture and release methods Follow these methods if your mitigation plans include capturing newts to reduce the chances of them being killed, disturbed or injured. Capture newts in the active season (between February and October). Capture methods include: using ring fencing and pitfall traps to catch newts as they move to a breeding pond in spring (but not every adult will migrate every year, so plan accordingly) hand searching, including dismantling refuges destructive searching (carefully stripping areas likely to have newts), but not in winter and only if you’ve tried all other methods netting, bottle trapping or draining ponds Release the newts in a sheltered area close to a suitable refuge or in a pond. Release the newts at night if possible, and don’t keep them in captivity longer than necessary. Exclude the newts from re-entering the area using fencing. Pitfall trapping as part of compensation Use this method to capture newts if there’s a genuine need to, for example if it’s not possible to survey the pond. Only use pitfall trapping when weather conditions allow it, never when there’s likely to be a frost. Fencing as part of mitigation or compensation You can use the following types of temporary fencing: drift fencing to guide great crested newts into pitfall traps exclusion fencing to prevent newts from entering an area Only use one-way fencing as a precaution alongside other capture methods. You can use permanent amphibian fencing if you need to exclude newts from the area in the long term. Restore or create aquatic habitats as compensation You can restore ponds for mitigation if: the development will only have small impacts on the newts there’s an opportunity to improve a low quality pond to support great crested newts Before restoring a pond check the plants and other animals it supports. Otherwise create new ponds rather than restoring existing ones. Restored or created ponds should be: positioned to avoid human or animal disturbance and agricultural run-off able to hold water throughout at least one summer in every 3 years Restored or created ponds should also have: a surface area between 100 and 800 square metres and be between 1 and 2 metres deep substantial cover of submerged and marginal vegetation open areas of waters and be clustered with other ponds populations of invertebrates and other amphibians for prey no fish and very few or no waterfowl shallow sloping sides and not be shaded on the south side You can also use wide ditches to support newt populations. You’ll need to create 2 ponds for every breeding pond lost. Creating several smaller ponds is often better than one very large pond. New ponds should be within 250 metres of each other with no barriers the newts can’t cross, like roads. Position new ponds within 250 metres of existing ponds. Don’t damage other rare or protected species when creating or managing ponds. Restore or create terrestrial habitats as compensation Include the area up to 500 metres around a mitigation pond when creating terrestrial habitat. This includes: scrub woodland hedgerows banks and ditches leaf litter rough grassland bare ground with fissures disturbed ground pasture Don’t rely on private gardens as compensation for terrestrial habitat lost through development. Receptor sites as compensation Survey the receptor site to make sure it doesn’t currently support great crested newts. This doesn’t apply if: the newts are moved or excluded within the same site you’re moving 20 adults (plus associated immature stages) or fewer You can introduce part populations to an existing population, but only if the habitat will be made suitable for the increased numbers. The receptor site should: be as close to the donor site as possible include (or be capable of including) the same types and mix of habitats that will be lost be at least the same size as the habitat due to be lost - if it’s smaller it should have better quality habitats be selected based on good land survey data from the site assessment and characteristics like connectivity and quality not be in a site of special scientific interest (SSSI) unless there’s no other suitable habitat nearby have no or limited public access - if there’s a strong case for public access, you’ll need to address the interference this could cause not be enclosed by permanent fencing (use exclosures to prevent newts accessing hazardous areas) allow for ongoing habitat management, maintenance and monitoring after the development Create refuges as compensation You can create hibernation and refuge sites for great crested newts, including: large piles of rubble rock log piles earth banks with plenty of mammal burrows and ground fissures You can also design new hibernacula (hibernation shelters). These should: be at least 2 metres long, 1 metre wide and 1 metre high be surrounded by rough vegetation have exposed edges for access be capped with topsoil, ideally covered with turf be filled with inert, clean hardcore, brick rubble, logs, sleepers or similar materials plus loose topsoil be above the floodline Position hibernation and refuge sites: so that some are close to the breeding pond, and some further away in sheltered areas that are not too dry, or prone to flooding or freezing in winter Discovering newts after development has started Stop all work that’s likely to affect great crested newts and break the law if great crested newts are found after development has started. If great crested newts have been previously been surveyed and identified as a constraint, contact your ecologist to discuss whether you’ll need mitigation or additional licences. Delays in development work If development work is delayed after you’ve put up amphibian fencing, leave them in place until work can continue. Fencing needs to be maintained to keep newts outside. You’ll need extra trapping if vegetation grows over the fence, or holes appear in it. Make sure great crested newts are fenced into small areas for as short a time as possible. You may need to to remove fencing if the delays are likely to be for some months. You might need to change the mitigation plan and ask for a licence variation from Natural England. You can only get a licence for up to 2 years in an enclosed receptor site. Management and site maintenance after development Your post-development management plans should include: managing the aquatic vegetation in ponds clearing trees or scrub around ponds desilting and clearing fallen leaves mowing, cutting or grazing grassland managing woodland and scrub The local planning authority will need to agree maintenance plans with the developer and the landowner. Problems you may need to deal with when setting up maintenance agreements include: introduced fish leaking ponds dumped rubbish fires, major pollution or similar damage damaged fences silted or blocked tunnels damaged interpretation boards Set out the timings and responsibilities in your management and maintenance plan. The plan should be in place for at least 4 years after the development. For schemes that have a big impact on newts, management and maintenance may need to go on indefinitely. Population monitoring Unless the scheme is very small, put a monitoring plan in place to assess the great crested newt population after mitigation. Use the same counting methods you used before the development so you can compare population trends. Here’s a guide to minimum requirements for monitoring. Population size/site importance Low impact monitoring requirements Medium impact monitoring requirements High impact monitoring requirements Small/low No monitoring required Presence/absence - 2 years Presence/absence - 4 years Medium No monitoring required Population size class - 4 years Population size class - 6 years High Population size class - 2 years Population size class - 6 years Population size class - 10 years The monitoring plan should state: who is responsible for monitoring when monitoring will happen what methods will be used Additional information if you need a mitigation licence The following guidance is for ecologists and developers who might want to apply for mitigation licence where they can’t avoid harming great crested newts and their habitat. The above standing advice should be followed together with the additional licensing guidance below, otherwise your licence application may be refused. If you need planning permission, you must get it before you apply for a licence. You can apply for a mitigation licence . You’ll need expert help from an ecologist: Chartered Institute of Ecology and Environment Management Environmental Data services (ENDS) Directory Fencing as part of mitigation or compensation Slope the fencing at an angle between 40 and 45 degrees to allow newts to climb into the receptor area but not escape. When installing temporary fencing: use an amphibian worker and a fencing contractor to instruct or supervise the work search and clear the fence line of newts first - carefully cut back vegetation if necessary use a membrane that won’t break down or become brittle, eg 1000 gauge transparent polythene sheeting, woven polypropylene or black polythene DPC make the membrane as taut as possible so there are no creases or folds make sure there’s a suitable underlap so the newts can’t pass underneath, and an overhang so they can’t climb over it place the backfill turf downwards in the trench and compact it so the newts won’t use it for shelter secure the fence to supporting posts with pads and nails or staples, not battens position fence posts outside the receptor area fence (and for drift fencing, on the side least likely to encounter newts) curl-join any joins in the membrane and secure them to a post with pads and nails - do this underground as well avoid gaps the newts could pass through use a stile if the fence crosses a footpath Protect the area with security fencing in areas open to the public. If you need to allow farm access through a fence, keep the gap as small as possible and turn back each end of the barrier 45 degrees to the fence. This deflects the newts away from the gap. Exclusion fencing may need ongoing maintenance to make sure it’s still working. The licence holder should keep a record of inspections and repair work to fences. When you take down the fencing, remove backfill carefully by hand if newts could be sheltering in it. Pitfall trapping as part of compensation Install more traps in areas where there are likely to be more newts, for example around breeding ponds and rough grassland. Include areas of short grass or bare ground in the fencing layout, especially close to breeding ponds. When installing pitfall traps: fit the traps flush to the barrier fence with their tops just below ground level - check they’re still in the right place especially after heavy rain space the traps between 5 and 10 metres apart - but you can use a higher density near breeding ponds, rubble piles and other areas newts are likely to be don’t use plastic buckets that have a lip - but you can use plastic tape to create a small overhang and stop the newts escaping You can place refuges (eg carpet tiles) along the fence line, to increase the chances of capture. When searching traps and moving the newts: open the traps every day before 11am unless the weather indicates capture rates would be low or zero record the location, species, sex and life stage of all newts captured use a suitable container to release the newts in the receptor area as soon as possible Breeding ponds You should ring-fence breeding ponds for at least one spring migration. Put pitfall traps on both sides of the fence. Capture adult and immature newts away from the pond, even during the breeding season. Trap from February to November, depending on local weather conditions, or until the data shows the site has been trapped successfully. To capture a significant proportion of the population, you’ll need to: trap around a breeding pond for at least 3 years, along with extra trapping away from the pond put considerable extra effort into trapping for one year, eg trapping over several months due to weather conditions changing from damp to cold Terrestrial habitats Use drift fencing and pitfall trapping for terrestrial habitats. Fence off the development area. You can use one-way fencing at the perimeter if the receptor and donor sites are next to each other. It’s better to divide the area into compartments with drift fencing rather than using fence lines or crosses, especially for large sites. This table shows the survey effort required - use the population size estimate from your surveys. Population size estimate Minimum traps per hectare Minimum number of trapping nights Small 50 30 Medium 80 60 Large 100 90 Trap on nights when: the night-time air temperature is above 5°C the ground is damp, eg if it’s raining or has rained in the last few days Trap for longer than the minimum nights shown in the table if you’re still capturing newts at the end of the minimum period. It’s usually safe to stop trapping if you make no captures after 5 trapping nights. Use other capture methods as well as pitfall trapping. Hand searching and night searching on land You can use hand searching and night searching as additional techniques alongside others. Ponds: capture methods Start with pitfall trapping and use a combination of other capture methods for ponds. Netting works best in small ponds or those with hard substrates and little vegetation. When using bottle trapping: set one trap for every 2 metres of shoreline trap over 90 nights of suitable weather conditions trap between mid-February and mid-June to remove breeding adults remove vegetation that supports eggs When draining a pond to catch the remaining newts: use screens with a mesh smaller than 1.5 millimeters fitted to pumps catch newts by netting as the water drains away, and hand search through plants, debris and silt when it’s drained use ring fencing with pitfall traps around the pond if draining overnight You can dig a narrow trench connected to the pond rather than draining directly from the pond, or drain the water into a nearby ditch to avoid using pumps. Create new ponds as part of compensation Create new ponds at least 6 months before moving the newts if: all the conditions are favourable the donor population is a “small population size class” Create new ponds at least one year before moving the newts for medium population size classes and 2 years for large population size classes. You can transfer water and vegetation from ponds that will be destroyed on the development site. Don’t introduce artificial egg laying substrates. On ground that drains easily, you can position refuges in an excavated dip. You can also provide smaller refuges for daytime shelter. Make sure these are secure if the site will be used by the public, eg use fencing to restrict access. It’s not acceptable to create a few hibernacula or daytime refuges as compensation for losing large areas of good quality terrestrial habitat. Releasing land for development When the capture programme has finished, remove fencing and pitfall traps carefully and capture any remaining newts in gaps or traps. Only fill in great crested newt ponds when: the capture records show there’s been a reasonable effort to trap the newts you’ve moved aquatic and marginal vegetation to receptor ponds you’ve extracted any pond water you’re going to put into new ponds you’ve searched the pond bed and surroundings for any remaining newts You can release land for development if the work won’t affect great crested newt habitats, for example by: interfering with migration or ongoing mitigation causing changes to the water level of breeding ponds storing spoil or stockpiles close to amphibian fencing the area has been trapped and great crested newts removed Population monitoring Include the qualitative checks you make in your monitoring report, for example presence of late-stage larvae. Send the results to Natural England with your licence returns."

Census 2001 Rural Urban Classification for a range of geographies  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs The Census 2001 Rural Urban Classification was updated by the 2011 Rural Urban Classification . The 2001 version has been retained for reference purposes only. The Rural-Urban Definition was first introduced in 2004 as a joint project between the Commission for Rural Communities (CRC – formerly the Countryside Agency), the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), the Office for National Statistics (ONS), the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) and the Welsh Assembly. It was delivered by the Rural Evidence Research Centre at Birkbeck College (RERC). The Local Authority (LA) Rural-Urban Classification was introduced in 2005 as a Defra initiative and was delivered by the Rural Evidence Research Centre at Birkbeck College (RERC). Many statistics are only available at Local Authority level so in order to examine rural and urban differences and similarities for these areas, it was necessary to classify the LAs based on their rurality. Prior to local government reorganisation in 2009, the classification used a slightly different methodology and some local councils were classified differently. Since April 2009, a new methodology was applied both to the new local council structure (326 councils in England) and to the old structure (354 councils). The 2001 rural urban classification was applied to larger geographies such as councils, parliamentary constituencies and counties. These broadly used the same methodology, based on the proportion of people living in rural settlements and large market towns and the number of people living in urban areas.

/government/news/billions-fewer-plastic-bags-on-the-streets,"Six billion fewer plastic bags taken home by shoppers in England and over £29 million donated to good causes thanks to 5p charge Billions fewer plastic bags on the streets  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Shoppers are set to take home around six billion fewer single-use plastic bags this year following the introduction of the 5p charge, early data published today indicates. This is the equivalent to the weight of roughly 300 blue whales, 300,000 sea turtles or three million pelicans. The charge has also resulted in donations of more than £29 million from retailers towards good causes including charities and community groups. Around eight million tonnes of plastic makes its way into oceans each year, posing a serious threat to our natural and marine environment – experts estimate that plastic is ingested by 31 species of marine mammals and over 100 species of sea birds. Environment Minister Thérèse Coffey said: Taking six billion plastic bags out of circulation is fantastic news for all of us – it will mean our precious marine life is safer, our communities are cleaner and future generations won’t be saddled with mountains of plastic sat taking hundreds of years to breakdown in landfill sites. The 5p charge has clearly been a huge success – not only for our environment but for good causes across the country that have benefitted from an impressive £29 million raised. It shows small actions can make the biggest difference, but we must not be complacent as there is always more we can all do to reduce waste and recycle what we use. Over seven billion carrier bags were issued by seven main retailers in 2014, falling to just over half a billion in the first six months of the 5p charge for single use carrier bags introduced in October 2015. Dr Sue Kinsey, Technical Specialist, Waste at the Marine Conservation Society said: We are delighted to see that the bag charge in England is showing positive results. This is a significant reduction that will benefit the environment as a whole, and our sea life in particular. There is always more that we can do and we encourage everyone to join in on our Great British Beach Clean this September to help keep our coastlines clean. The data has been published, along with guidance for the plastic bag charge."
/guidance/commons-registers-how-to-apply-to-make-changes,"Overview for people who want to apply to make a change to the registers of common land or the registers of town and village greens.  Commons registers: how to apply to make changes Land management Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs The registers of common land and of town and village greens record information about where the land is, with details of the rights of common over the land. You can apply to make changes to the registers to add new information, or change existing information so as to: record a new event , which is something that has happened since 1 October 2008 in an original registration authority area or 15 December 2014 in Cumbria and North Yorkshire record a historic event , which is something that happened before 1 October 2008 in a pioneer registration authority area or 15 December 2014 in Cumbria and North Yorkshire correct a mistake or anomaly in the register – this is called a rectification application The commons registers are held by commons registration authorities. These are the top-tier local authority for an area (such as a county council or a metropolitan borough). You can only apply to register new events and historic events if the land or right of common over it is in the area of a pioneer registration authority or a 2014 registration authority. The pioneer registration authorities are: Blackburn with Darwen Council Cornwall Council Devon County Council (but not including Plymouth or Torbay) Herefordshire Council Hertfordshire County Council Kent County Council (but not including Medway) Lancashire County Council (but not including Blackpool) The 2014 authorities are: Cumbria County Council North Yorkshire County Council If you want to apply to amend the registers but the land or right of common is not in one of the areas above, there are only 5 types of rectification application that you can make. You can apply to correct a mistake made by the registration authority or to remove land that was wrongly registered as common land or as a town or village green. How to apply ‘Part 1 of the Commons Act 2006’ is the name of the legislation that allows you to apply to change the commons registers. The different sections of Part 1 relate to different types of application that can be made to change the registers. For example, you will see guidance that says “you can apply to create a new right of common under Section 6”. But the laws for the application process are set out in The Commons Registration (England) Regulations 2014 (referred to as the regulations). Your application must be on the correct form, because each form relates to a different type of change to the registers. If it’s not on the correct form the registration authority can’t process your application. You can apply as an individual, or as an organisation or a business, such as a limited company or a partnership. If you’re applying on behalf of a body, you must make that clear. Land in 2 authorities’ areas Some areas of registered land straddle the boundary between 2 registration authorities’ areas. They may have a ‘straddling agreement’, which means that only one of them is the registration authority for that land. If your application relates to land that straddles a boundary, check which registration authority you need to apply to. Fees Registration authorities charge fees for most types of application. The fees must be published on their website. There are certain types of application that the registration authority can’t charge for. Ask your registration authority or check the list in Schedule 5 of the regulations . The Planning Inspectorate can also charge fees. These are shown in Schedule 6 of the regulations . Inspection and copies of the commons registers Each ‘register unit’ (typically a common or a green) has its own number, and 2 sections: the land section, which describes the registered piece of land and refers to the register map, which is also part of the register the rights section, which sets out rights of common (the formal rights to use the land) registered over that land There may also be a third section, the ownership section, which gives details of the claimed owner of the land (but it could be wrong or out of date). The ownership section is only of historic value as the ownership of land is now recorded by the Land Registry. You can ask to see the commons registers and associated information. There’s no charge for this. You can make copies of the registers for free. However, if you ask the registration authority to give you copies of the registers or other records, it may charge you a fee. You should say whether you want an ‘official copy’ (certified by the registration authority as a true copy of the register), as a higher fee may be charged for official copies. Documents you need to send with your application You must include a copy of every document that is asked for on the application form. It’s better not to send original documents. Instead send copies, preferably certified, for example by a solicitor, to say that they have been checked against the original. Enclose a note to say where the originals can be inspected. You don’t need to send copies of any document that was issued by the registration authority or that you know that it has in its possession. Maps The application form will tell you whether you must provide a map. If you do, your map must be at least of the following scales (you can use a larger-scale map showing the land in more detail if you want to): at least 1:2,500 to show any land that you want to add to or remove from the register, unless the land is moorland or mostly moorland , in which case, you may use a map at a scale of at least 1:10,560 at least 1:10,560 for any other land Use an up-to-date Ordnance Survey map. Suppliers of digital historical Ordnance Survey maps can be found on the internet. Ownership You need to provide evidence of ownership of the land for most types of application, but the form will explain if this is necessary. For example, you can only make some types of application if you are the landowner or if you have the owner’s consent. Ownership means owning the freehold. If the land ownership is registered with the Land Registry , contact them for an office copy of the individual register for your registered title. If the land is not registered with the Land Registry, you may need to supply a good root of title. This means copies of conveyances (transfers of title) of the land, showing the buyer and the land they bought, going back at least 15 years. Stamp Duty Land Tax If your application to amend the register will affect a right of common, you will have to pay stamp duty land tax (SDLT) if the value of the transaction is greater than £150,000. (This amount is called the ‘zero-rated threshold’.) You’ll need to complete an SDLT return and pay the tax within 30 days of the date of the transaction. You won’t normally have to pay SDLT if you’re applying to register a historic event that took place before 1 October 2008. Find out more about SDLT or contact the Stamp Office at: Birmingham Stamp Office HM Revenue & Customs 9th floor, City Centre House 30 Union Street Birmingham B2 4AR Telephone: 08456 030 135 Get help You should contact your registration authority for advice. Part of its role is to decide your application so it must remain impartial, which means you are responsible both for deciding which form is appropriate for the type of amendment you want to make and for completing the form. Consider taking independent expert advice, such as from a solicitor with experience in this area of law, if you need detailed advice. You may also be able to get help from organisations such as the National Farmers’ Union , the Country Land and Business Association or the Open Spaces Society . What happens to your application If your application is complete, the next steps will typically include: the registration authority will advertise your application, asking for representations; these have to be made within 42 days of the last notice it may ask you for more information it will send you copies of the representations it receives to you for comment, and if necessary your own comments will be copied to others for their comments it may refer your application to the Planning Inspectorate the registration authority or the Planning inspectorate may ask you to present your case at a hearing or a public inquiry the registration authority will write to you with the decision if your application is granted, the registration authority will change the register Referral to the Planning Inspectorate The registration authority must refer your application to the Planning Inspectorate (PINS) if the registration authority has an interest in your application and people are unlikely to be confident in its impartiality. There are other types of application that must be referred to PINS, but only if someone with a legal interest your application has objected to it. These are rectification applications : to correct a mistake in the register by adding or removing land from the registers or to correct the number of rights, in other words, the number of grazing animals (a Section 19 application) to add land to, or remove wrongly registered land from, the registers (a Schedule 2 application under paragraphs 4 to 9) The Planning Inspectorate may ask you for more evidence or information. Hearings and public inquiries The registration authority or PINS must give you a hearing if it is thinking of refusing your application. This is to talk about the key aspects of your application and to answer any possible points of conflict. It must also give a hearing to anyone else whose civil rights would be affected by the outcome of your application. The registration authority and the Planning Inspectorate may decide to hold a public inquiry into your application. This is more likely if there is considerable opposition to your application. Site inspections You may be asked to attend a site visit. If there is to be public inquiry, the inspector (who oversees the inquiry) must organise a site visit unless the landowner refuses entry. Even without a public inquiry into your application, the registration authority and PINS can decide to hold a site visit. Withdrawing or changing your application You can tell the registration authority that you want to withdraw or change your application, but they don’t have to agree to it. However, they may agree, for example, if it would be fair to let you, or to correct something that is clearly wrong (such as a map showing a house that doesn’t exist). They may refuse if the withdrawal or change would affect the interests of others. Decisions Once your application has been decided (whether by the registration authority or PINS), the registration authority must: tell you and everyone who made representations publish the decision and the reasons for it on its website amend the register as soon as possible Challenging a decision You can’t appeal against the registration authority or the Planning Inspectorate’s decision. You can ask the High Court to review the actions of a registration authority or the Planning Inspectorate, but court action can be very expensive, and you should get legal advice before you do. You can also ask the High Court to order the register to be corrected if an entry, or any information in an entry, has been secured by fraud. Further information You can find further information about registering land from: the Open Spaces Society Commons Act 2006: Re-Registration of Common Land Nearly all the important cases decided by the courts since 2000 (and some before that date) are published on the British and Irish Legal Information Institute website.

Find more information about applying to change the commons registers to help you with your application. Apply to add common land or greens to the registers You can apply to register land that is legally recognised as being common land or a town or village green, but has not been registered. To register land as common land, the land must be recognised by one of the following: the land is regulated by an order of regulation made under the Commons Act 1876 and confirmed by a provisional order confirmation Act; find a list of these commons and greens the land is subject to a scheme made under the Metropolitan Commons Acts 1866–1898 or Part I of the Commons Act 1899; a list of commons and greens subject to schemes made before 1980 is available from the Defra casework database for information about schemes made since 1981, contact the relevant district council or National Park authority the land is regulated as common land under a local or personal Act the land is otherwise recognised or designated as common land under any other enactment To register land as a green, the land must have been alloted under an Act for recreation on 31 July 1970, and still is on the date of your application. You may be able to register the following common land and greens which were exempted from registration under the Commons Registration Act 1965: Amersham: Austenwood Common, Coleshill Common, Gold Hill Common, Hyde Heath, Ley Hill Common Brentwood: Shenfield Common Bromley: West Wickham Common, Spring Park Coventry: Greyfriars Green, Hearsall Common, Keresley Common, Stoke Commons, Top Green, Whitley Common Croydon: Coulsdon Common, Farthingdown Common, Kenley Common, Riddlesdown Common Egham: Thorpe Green Esher: Brook Hill Common, Downside Common,Leigh Hill Common, Little Heath Common, Old Common, Oxshott Heath, Upper and Lower Tilt Commons Hampshire: Otterbourne Hill Common Harrogate: The Stray Merton: Mitcham Common Portland: Victoria Gardens Slough: Cippenham Village Green Common Southampton: West End Road Recreation Ground Watford: Cassiobridge Common Whitley Bay: The Links Common York: Micklegate Stray Who can apply Anyone can apply using form CA13 . You don’t need to be the owner of the land. You’ll be applying under under Schedule 2 paragraphs 2 or 3. But if your application relates to land (or any part of it) that is covered by a building or is within the curtilage of a building (the land that ‘belongs’ to a building), then you must provide the landowner’s consent with your application. In order to establish ownership of the land, you may need to check the Land Registry . Apply to register waste land of the manor as common land Waste land of the manor is land that is open, uncultivated and unoccupied and either belongs to, or used to belong to, a manor. You can apply to have it registered as common land if someone applied for provisional registration of that land under the 1965 Act, someone objected and then: the Commons Commissioner cancelled the registration only because the land was no longer connected with the manor or the Commons Commissioner cancelled the registration because there were no rights of common on the land, but did not then consider whether the land could be registered as waste land of the manor instead or the applicant for registration asked for the registration to be cancelled or agreed to it Most land in England is land that formerly belonged to a manor. It is seldom possible to prove beyond doubt that a particular parcel of land was part of a manor. But it should be enough to show that on balance, there’s no convincing evidence to disprove it. There are several sources of information about manors: The A2A (Access to Archives) Local records offices The manorial documents register on the National Archives British History Online The Victoria County History You will probably find it helpful to refer to copies of the Commissioner’s decision letters which are held by Defra in both bound and electronic form. Contact the Commons and Access Implementation Team about the bound volumes. Who can apply Anyone can apply using form CA13 . You don’t need to be the owner of the land. You’ll be applying under under Schedule 2 paragraph 4. What you can’t apply for You can’t claim or register any of the former rights of common over the land because those rights were extinguished. Apply to have common land instead registered as a town or village green You can apply to have a town or village green that was mistakenly registered as common land swapped back to the register of town or village greens. Greens get greater protection from the law and local people will gain the right to use the green for sports and pastimes. Any rights of common over the land will remain even if it is recorded in the register of town or village greens. You will need to show that when the land was provisionally registered it was in fact a town or village green as: it was land that had been legally set aside for exercise or recreation, for example under an inclosure award it was land that people had a customary right to use for lawful sports and pastimes , meaning before living memory it was land that people had used for lawful sports and pastimes as of right for 20 years or more Who can apply Anyone can apply using form CA13 . You don’t need to be the owner of the land. You’ll be applying under under Schedule 2 paragraph 5. Apply to deregister buildings wrongly registered as common land or as a town or village green You can apply to deregister common land or a town or village green that was covered by a building, or the curtilage of a building (meaning it ‘belongs’ to a building), when it was registered. Your application will need to show all of the following: the land was provisionally registered between 2 January 1967 and 31 July 1970; you can check this in the commons registers the land was covered by a building, or within the curtilage of building, when it was provisionally registered the land is still covered by a building or within the curtilage of a building when you apply Who can apply Anyone can apply using form CA13 . You don’t need to be the owner of the land. You’ll be applying under under Schedule 2 paragraph 6 for common land, and Schedule 2 paragraph 8 for town and village greens. Apply to deregister “other land” wrongly registered as common land or as a town or village green You can apply for the deregistration of other land that was wrongly registered as common land or as a town or village green. But only if the following circumstances apply: the land was provisionally registered as common land between 2 January 1967 and 31 July 1970; check this in the commons registers the provisional registration of the land was not referred to a Commons Commissioner (the entry in the commons registers will normally say ‘undisputed’); when the land was provisionally registered it wasn’t: land subject to rights of common waste land of a manor a town or village green because it was physically unusable for recreation during the 20 previous years and the land was not, and is still not, alloted by an Act for recreation land of a description specified in section 11 of the Inclosure Act 1845, which includes gated and stinted pastures, land held in severalty by joint tenants and equivalent lands (but check section 11) Who can apply Anyone can apply using form form CA13 . You don’t need to be the owner of the land. You’ll be applying under under Schedule 2 paragraph 7 if you want to deregister common land, and under Schedule 2 paragraph 9 if you want to deregister a town or village green. Apply to correct the registers You can apply under Section 19 to correct certain types of mistake in the registers. This includes omissions and unclear or ambiguous descriptions. But mistakes cannot be corrected when other people have reasonably relied on the current version of the register and the registration authority thinks it would now be unfair to change it. Apply to correct mistakes made by the registration authority You can apply to correct any mistake that was made by the registration authority when it made or amended an entry in the register. Your application will need to show that the registration authority is responsible for the mistake. So, for example, if an applicant attached a map with a mistake in it to their registration, the mistake was the applicant’s and not the registration authority’s. Apply for the correction of other mistakes that don’t affect land or the quantification of rights You can apply to have any other mistake corrected, whoever made the mistake. If the mistake was made because of a flaw in the information provided (or omitted) at the relevant time, or because the proper procedures were not followed at that time. You could ask for the following to be corrected, for example: the description or the map of a dominant tenement the attachment of a right of common to a farmhouse, to show that it should instead have been recorded as a right in gross (granted to a person, under a deed) to define an internal grazing boundary so that a right of common applies over part, but not all, of a common or a green a private right noted in the register the name of a register unit The corrections you’re asking for mustn’t affect the area of the registered land, nor what can be done under the right of common. Apply to have a duplicate entry removed You can apply to have a duplicate entry in the register removed, whether the registration authority or another person caused the mistake. Apply to have names and addresses updated You can apply to update someone’s name or address. This is most common for the registered owner of a right held in gross, when the owner of the right moves or changes his or her name (for example, when they get married). Apply to change the area of common land or a town or village green if a water body changes it If the boundary of common land or a green follows a body of water (such as a river, a lake or the sea), the line of that water body may change over time. This could increase or decrease the area of land in the common or green. You can apply to correct the register with these changes. If the land is subject to rights of common, these rights will also be adjusted. Who can apply Anyone can apply under Section 19; use form CA10 .

/guidance/litter-and-refuse-council-responsibilities-to-keep-land-clear,"How councils should deal with litter, refuse and dog mess, and the penalties they can give. Litter and refuse: council responsibilities to keep land clear  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs District councils and some other authorities must keep land in their area clear of litter and refuse (including dog mess), as far as is practicable . Authorities who must keep land clear The councils that are litter authorities are: county councils district councils single-tier councils (unitary authorities) London borough councils the Common Council of the City of London the Council of the Isles of Scilly Other authorities are responsible for litter on all or parts of their own land. These include: Crown authorities educational institutions Network Rail and rail and tram operators water companies Land councils must keep clear Council litter authorities are responsible for land where all of the following apply: it’s open to the air on at least one side it’s under their direct control it’s publicly accessible (with or without payment) This is called ‘relevant land’. Relevant land includes beaches (above the average high water mark). Highways Councils must also keep any highway they’re responsible for both clean and clear of litter and refuse (as far as is practicable). Code of practice on litter and refuse Litter authorities must ‘have regard to’ the code of practice on litter and refuse which explains how different types of land should be kept clear. This means they must consider the code, and they must follow it unless there are clear, justifiable reasons not to do so in specific circumstances. How to deal with littering Councils can fine anyone who drops litter on land or into water that’s accessible to the public even if it’s private land. This applies to private land that the public can access, for example a right of way. Offenders can be prosecuted in a magistrates’ court and fined up to £2,500. Litter droppers can get fixed penalty notices ( FPNs ) . If they don’t pay the FPN they can be prosecuted. FPNs aren’t appropriate for: people who leave their rubbish out for collection at the wrong time someone who drops litter accidentally cases where it’s not in the public interest repeat offenders (they should be prosecuted) Public space protection orders Councils can issue public space protection orders ( PSPOs ) for problems in public spaces, including the control of dogs . PSPOs can make it an offence if dog owners do any of the following: don’t clean up after their dogs allow their dogs to enter particular places that have a PSPO , like playgrounds or parks Litter abatement orders A litter authority can be taken to court if they don’t keep publicly accessible land that they’re responsible for clear of litter and refuse. A litter authoritiy can be ordered by a court to pay the complainant’s costs. A litter authority can avoid court action if they clear the land within 5 days of being notified. Courts can issue a litter abatement order ( LAO ) requiring the litter authority to clear land of litter within a certain time. A litter authority is breaking the law if they don’t comply with an LAO and can be fined up to £2,500. They can also get further fines of up to £125 a day for each day the offence continues after conviction. Street litter control notices for businesses Street litter control notices ( SLCNs ) give councils the power to require businesses to clear litter from around their premises.

/government/news/free-fishing-for-children,"Environment Agency announces shake-up of rod licences after listening to calls from anglers Free fishing for children  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Environment Agency The Environment Agency has announced a shake-up of rod licences, following feedback from anglers all over England. The changes include a free rod licence for junior anglers which is hoped to encourage more young people to give fishing a go and secure the future of the sport. Other moves include a rolling rod licence that lasts for 365 days from the day you buy it – rather than only running up until the end of March regardless of when it was bought. The third change is one which carp and specimen anglers have long campaigned for: the use of 3 rods having just 1 licence, rather than needing 2. There are also some small increases to standard charges – for example, a coarse fishing licence has been raised from £27 to £30. This is the first time the cost of a rod licence has increased since 2010 and all additional income generated will all go back into improving fisheries and services for anglers. Sarah Chare, head of fisheries at the Environment Agency, said: “These exciting changes reflect feedback from our customers. We hope that a 365 day licence, a 3-rod licence and a free junior licence can all play an important part in getting more young people fishing and securing the future of the sport. All money raised from rod licence sales is ploughed back into England’s fisheries, and is used to fund a wide range of projects to improve facilities for anglers.” Environment Secretary Andrea Leadsom said: “This shake-up for rod licences is great news for anglers across the country. The changes announced today will help simplify the system and encourage more young people to get involved with the sport and connect with nature.” The Angling Trust is the national representative and governing body for angling in England and they welcome the changes. Mark Lloyd, Chief Executive of the Angling Trust & Fish Legal, said: “The Angling Trust lobbied the Environment Agency to make these changes to the rod licence system as many of the carp and specimen anglers we represent had complained about the need for them to buy 2 separate licences, for 4 rods, when they wanted to fish with 3, so the new extra rod licence option is very welcome indeed. “We also wanted a free junior licence as this removes a significant barrier to participation for young people considering taking up the sport. Well done to the Environment Agency for listening and taking anglers’ concerns on board.” The Environment Agency listened to a wide range of anglers, partners and interested organisations to ensure the new prices and products meet customer needs. There are flexible options to choose from too – another change is the ability to upgrade from a 1 or 8 day licence to a full licence with the price of the 1 or 8 day deducted. This is to encourage more people to keep fishing once they have tried it and make it cheaper for anglers who currently buy several short term licences. The changes come into effect in March 2017 with new licences valid from 1 April. Notes to editors Juniors will still need to register and receive a licence in order to fish but the licence will be free. These changes are also being implemented across Wales. Natural Resources Wales is the lead. Anglers are legally required to hold a valid fishing licence to fish in rivers, lakes and other inland waters in England (except the River Tweed) and the Border Esk (and its tributaries) in Scotland. A rod licence is a legal requirement for fishing. Anyone fishing illegally is cheating other licence paying anglers, can expect to be prosecuted and face a substantial fine. Last year in England, the Environment Agency checked more than 62,000 rod licences and prosecuted more than 1,900 anglers for rod and line offences resulting in fines and costs in excess of £500,000. For the minority who flout the rules, the most common offence is fishing without a valid licence. Fishing without a valid licence could land you with a fine of up to £2,500 and a criminal record.

/government/news/scales-that-tell-tales," The lifestory of Atlantic salmon is kept as a permanent record in their scales and could help efforts to protect future fish stocks, Defra-… Scales that tell tales  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs The lifestory of Atlantic salmon is kept as a permanent record in their scales and could help efforts to protect future fish stocks, Defra-funded research has found. The research published today in the journal Scientific Reports helps solve the long-standing mystery of where in the ocean Atlantic salmon go to feed when they leave British waters, and could shed light on why numbers have declined since the 1970s. As with trees, the growth of salmon scales can be seen as a series of rings, with the most growth occurring when they are feeding out at sea. Scientists took a portion of the scale from when the fish was at sea, and measured the carbon isotopes which are stored in the scale as collagen. By matching the carbon levels with satellite records of ocean surface temperature, the scientists were able to predict where in the Atlantic the fish were living and feeding. Richard Benyon, Fisheries Minister, said: “There is so much about the habits of fish when they leave our rivers that remains a mystery. This ground-breaking research will be vital in helping us to learn about their feeding behaviour out at sea, and how best to protect their numbers for future generations.” More than 500 scales were analysed from archived samples at the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas) and the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH). The research found that fish from different rivers were swimming to completely different areas in the ocean when they left the British shores. For example, salmon from rivers including the River Tyne in the North East were swimming towards the Norwegian Sea, whereas fish from the River Frome in Dorset were feeding close to Iceland. Dr Kirsteen MacKenzie, lead author of the research from the University of Sounthampton, said: “As every single salmon contains a natural chemical tag, we can now see where fish from individual rivers go to feed in the Atlantic. We found that salmon born in two areas of the British Isles swim to feeding grounds that are far apart, and experience very different conditions while at sea.” Co-author Dr Clive Trueman, also from the University of Southampton, continued: “Our technique can also be used to aid conservation of animals such as turtles, seabirds and tuna, and identify the best areas for marine protection measures.” The research was funded through a £66,000 grant from Defra. Further research is now ongoing to chart the habits of many more Atlantic salmon populations when they leave British rivers."

Scientists at East Malling Research are developing  varieties of strawberry that are better able to cope with the predicted effects of climate change, particularly higher summer temperatures and less rainfall.  The new varieties will require less water to grow and need fewer chemical inputs, therefore reducing the environmental impact of strawberry production in the UK. Each year, an estimated 27,000 kilos of strawberries, along with 7,000 litres of cream, are consumed at Wimbledon. With summer upon us and Wimbledon in full swing, demand for strawberries in British supermarkets is sky high, and new more resistant varieties will help growers meet this demand at the championships for years to come. Environment Secretary Caroline Spelman said: “Strawberries are quite simply the taste of the summer, as inherently British as Wimbledon itself.  Innovative research such as this may revolutionize the way we grow the nation’s favourite berry.” These new strawberries are being bred by crossing robust UK and foreign lines that contain desirable traits such as disease resistance, high productivity and temperatures tolerance. The new strawberry varieties are then being trialled in the field and assessed on six characteristics: yield, fruit size, taste, shelf life, percentage waste and disease resistance. Dr David Simpson from East Malling Research said: “Consumer demand for fresh strawberries in the UK has been growing year on year since the early 1990s. The British growers have done a great job of increasing their productivity to satisfy this demand between April and October. The future will be challenging due to the impacts of climate change and the withdrawal of many pesticides but the breeding programme at EMR is using the latest scientific approaches to develop a range of varieties that will meet the needs of our growers for the future.” East Malling Research are holding a Fruit Focus event  on 20th July 2011 where key representatives from the Strawberry Breeding Club will be available to discuss two new UK strawberry varieties. **Notes ** For more information on Fruit Focus, visit the  EMR website ."

/government/news/fisheries-uk-fights-to-end-discards-in-deal-with-no-winners,"The UK has secured an agreement to a complete review of the controversial cod recovery plan for 2011. Fisheries: UK fights to end discards in deal with no winners  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs The UK has secured an agreement to a complete review of the controversial cod recovery plan for 2011, including current days at sea restrictions, at the December Fisheries Council in Brussels today. During the meeting the UK also successfully fought for a 12 per cent increase in North Sea cod quota to allow expansion of the successful catch quota trials. Both deals will support our ongoing fight to stop perfectly edible fish being thrown overboard. The Commissioner also paved the way for sanctions against Iceland and the Faroes following their decision to walk out of mackerel talks earlier this month. Speaking from Brussels, Richard Benyon, Minister for the Natural Environment and Fisheries, said: “After two days of intense negotiations, with no clear winners, I am more convinced than ever that the Common Fisheries Policy is broken and needs radical reform. The Commission is right to place scientific evidence at the centre of the agreement and I am very pleased that they have responded to our calls to find a better way to end the dreadful waste of discards, but much more can still be done. “I have been fighting hard to protect the livelihoods of our fishermen both now and in the long-term, but what we need is a new CFP so we can better manage our fish stocks and ensure the industry is sustainable. “It is good to hear that the Commission are listening seriously to our concerns over Iceland and Faroe Island’s irresponsible behaviour on mackerel and are considering formal action. Iceland and the Faroe Islands’ plans to plunder mackerel from the sea threaten the health of our fishing industry and the long term future of these stocks.” The current cod recovery plan places strong restrictions on the number of days that fishermen can spend at sea, forcing them to catch as much as possible on each day and increasing the likelihood of discards. During the review the UK will push for more days at sea and industry-wide recognition of the importance of sustainable fishing, meaning that fishermen should discard less. The expansion of the catch quota trials will bring more fishermen into the scheme, further improving scientific evidence on conservation of fish stocks and reducing discards. Fishermen are allowed to catch more fish but have to land everything they catch and on-board CCTV checks to make sure they aren’t throwing any fish back into the sea. The call for action against Iceland and the Faroes follows both countries’ announcement of plans to increase their mackerel catch - ignoring scientific advice - and their refusal to be part of an agreement with the EU and Norway on an appropriate way to manage the mackerel stock. At December Fisheries Council the UK also successfully negotiated a number of other concessions. These include: resisting calls to expand the cod recovery plan into the Celtic Sea. Cod is only a small proportion of the fish caught in this area and the introduction of restricted days at sea would have had a very negative impact on fishermen in the region. fighting off a division of the English Channel into the Eastern and Western Channel sections, which would have resulted in a serious loss of UK fishing opportunities. resisting the breakup of the Irish Sea into smaller ‘functional units’ for management of Nephrops stocks, which we believe would be impractical and costly to implement. fighting off any reductions of fishing days for the Western Channel sole which, together with a 15 percent increase in the UK’s quota, brings a significant win for British fishermen."
/government/news/call-for-olympian-effort-against-aquatic-non-native-species,"Non-native invasive species cost the British economy at least £1.7 billion each year and millions of pounds is spent on aquatic invaders alone. Call for Olympian effort against aquatic non-native species  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Gold medal Olympic rower and London 2012 ambassador, Ben Hunt-Davis joined Environment Minister Richard Benyon today to launch the Check, Clean, Dry campaign to stop the spread of aquatic invasive non-native species. The campaign aims to counter the threat to Britain’s economy and wildlife posed by the spread of invasive non-native species such as the “killer shrimp”. Richard Benyon said: “Aggressive species from across the world have the potential to reach Britain and cause real damage and even wipe out some of our native wildlife. “We all have a duty to stop this from happening, and all those that use the water for recreation and sport can do their bit by heeding the advice to Check, Clean and Dry their boats and gear. Just a few moments care can mean the difference between keeping our rivers and lakes healthy or infecting them with the likes of a killer shrimp or invasive non-native plants.” Ben Hunt-Davis said: “Rowers, along with other recreational water users, need to be aware of the simple actions they can take to protect our aquatic environments, not just from the killer shrimp but from all invasive non-native plants and animals. “We all have a responsibility towards our natural environment so it is particularly encouraging to see so many organisations behind this campaign. “Though we may have different interests, by working together under a common theme - Check, Clean, Dry - we can really drive this important message home. I’m really pleased therefore to support this campaign.” The campaign is aimed at all those that use the water for recreation and sport who can unwittingly spread non-native invasive species as they move between different bodies of water like rowing lakes. Individual organisms, eggs, larvae and plant fragments can be carried on equipment, clothing and footwear. All recreational water users can take some simple steps to help prevent the infection of healthy waterways: Check equipment and clothing for live organisms - particularly in areas that are damp or hard to inspect. Clean and wash all equipment, footwear and clothing thoroughly.   If you do come across any organisms, leave them at the water body where you found them. Dry all equipment and clothing - some species can live for many days in moist conditions.  Make sure you don’t transfer water elsewhere. Defra is working with the Welsh Assembly Government and a wide range of conservation agencies and charities to tackle the threat posed by non-native aquatic species, but the public also has a vital role to play. Chief Executive of the Angling Trust, Mark Lloyd, said: “Invasive non-native species are of great concern to anglers. We are seeing fisheries in rivers and lakes being destroyed by their presence. We fully support this campaign to stop the spread and urge all water users to follow this best practice.” Chief Executive of the British Canoe Union, Paul Owen, said: “The BCU takes very seriously the need for biosecurity and we fully support the campaign. All of the home nations have produced clear guidelines for all canoeists in their country as to how to prevent the spread of alien species. Canoe England has the ‘You, Your Canoe and the environment’ leaflet which clearly defines best practice in terms of the environment and biosecurity. Canoeing is the most popular watersport and we encourage all canoeists, members or not, to follow our guidance for the environment and biosecurity.” British Rowing Facilities Consultant, Alan Meegan, said: “British Rowing is committed to helping Defra contain the spread of invasive aquatic species from overseas. Defra has been very pro-active over this and we are pleased to support them in doing all that we can to protect our native species”. RYA Planning and Environmental Advisor, Caroline Price, said: “The RYA welcomes this new awareness campaign. A joined-up approach is vital if we are to encourage best practice and prevent the spread of invasive species.” Head of Science at the Salmon & Trout Association, Janina Gray, said: “Invasive non-native species can cause far-reaching ecological imbalances within watercourses, so controlling their spread is vital if we are to protect native species and their habitats” More information on the new campaign can be found at www.direct.gov.uk/checkcleandry Notes The campaign has the support of major bodies, water user groups and conservation organisations including: Anglian Water, Angling Trust, Association of Rivers Trusts, British Canoe Union, British Marine Federation, British Rowing, Environment Agency, Freshwater Biological Association, Natural England, Royal Yachting Association, and Salmon & Trout association.

Lord Henley said: “The issue of dangerous dogs is not just a problem of dangerous breeds but also one of bad owners. They need to be held to account and stopped from ruining people’s lives. “Dangerous dogs are a major issue affecting many people. This is why I am working closely with Ministerial colleagues in the Home Office on the anti-social behaviour dimension to this issue. We are also working with groups such as the RSPCA to look at other issues raised in the consultation, such as breed-specific bans, micro-chipping and attacks on private property.” Lord Henley said that he would announce the Government’s approach to dangerous dogs early in the New Year. Responses to many of the forty proposals in the dangerous dogs consultation were strongly divided, with primary concerns being whether the bans on specific dog breeds were the best approach to reduce dog attacks, and how to deal promptly and effectively with those that allow their dogs to be a nuisance to others. Notes The responses to the consultation on dangerous dogs launched by the previous Government can be found on the National Archive website .

Local authorities receive additional funding to prepare for floods  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs £21million worth of grants to help councils protect and support their own community when managing flood risk has been confirmed by Environment Secretary Caroline Spelman. The funds will fully cover the costs for local authorities of putting into place and carrying out new responsibilities under the Flood and Water Management Act 2010, such as flood mapping, producing risk management plans and supporting community flood awareness groups. The funds have been allocated based on the individual risk that each local authority has. Funding for 2011/12 will total £21 million rising to £36million for 2012/13 and subsequent years of this Spending Review period. Environment Secretary Caroline Spelman said: “This money will go a long way to help local flood authorities identify and deal with the risk of flooding in their own communities, Each local authority can decide where the money will be of most use - it could be used to pay members of staff, to come up with plans of dealing with surface water flooding or for generally work with the public on how best to deal with flooding.” Each lead local flood authority is set to receive at least £110,000. Notes to editors: Funding will be allocated to Lead Local Flood Authorities (LLFAs). LLFAs are established under the Flood and Water Management Act 2010. LLFAs are responsible for local flood risk management, including surface water. The money will be allocated as Area Based Grant. Area Based Grant is allocated direct to each local authority. Local authorities will have complete flexibility to spend the additional funding as they see fit. Amounts are allocated according to the risk each LLFA is expected to need to manage. Funding is provided as part of the minimum of £2.1 billion the Government expects to spend on flood and coastal erosion risk management by 2015. Local authorities also receive funding under formula grant arrangements administered by Communities and Local Government.

/government/news/defra-approves-gm-potato-trial,"The research is on potatoes that have been genetically modified to resist late potato blight. Defra approves GM potato trial  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Following a public consultation, Defra has given approval to the Sainsbury Laboratory to conduct a research trial this year of GM potatoes.  The research is on potatoes that have been genetically modified to resist late potato blight. The Sainsbury Laboratory application has been evaluated by the independent expert group the Advisory Committee of Releases to the Environment (ACRE).  It is satisfied that the proposed trial will not result in any adverse effect on human health or the environment. In line with ACRE’s advice, precautionary conditions have been attached to the statutory consent for the trial.  These aim to ensure that GM potato material does not persist at the trial site.  The harvested GM potatoes will not be used for food or animal feed.

Approval for GM release in proposed Typhoid vaccine trial  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Clinical trials such as this must be authorised by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). However, in this case, an additional but separate approval from Defra is required because this trial involves the release of a live GMO into the environment. As yet, Emergent has not applied for Clinical Trial Authorisation from the MHRA. Defra is required to assess the risks to the environment and to people not involved in the trial. The application has been evaluated by the independent expert group the Advisory Committee of Releases to the Environment (ACRE).  It is satisfied that the release of this GMO will not have an adverse effect on human health and the environment, providing the required precautionary measures are taken. The MHRA is responsible for regulating the quality and safety aspects of clinical trials, including the safety of participants involved in the trial and ensuring that the required regulatory standards are met. For a clinical trial to proceed in the UK it must have received an authorisation from the MHRA known as a CTA (Clinical Trial Authorisation). Reflecting ACRE’s advice, precautionary conditions have been attached to the consent for the trial. Inspectors will visit the clinic involved in the trial on behalf of Defra to ensure that all the conditions of the consent to release a GMO are being met. Notes Defra has been consulted on this because the trial involves the release of a live genetically modified organism, and it is therefore obliged to assess any risks to human health or the environment from the release and give its approval before the trial can go ahead. It is Defra’s responsibility to assess the safety of people who are not taking part in the trial. It is the responsibility of the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency to consider the risks to human health of those involved in the trial. The applicant (Emergent) will seek authorisation for the clinical trial from the MHRA in March. The relevant ACRE advice is available at http://archive.defra.gov.uk/acre/pubs.htm"
/government/news/appointments-to-the-national-forest-company,"Catherine Graham-Harrison appointed as Chair and Roger Clarke as a Non-Executive Director of the National Forest Company. Appointments to the National Forest Company  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Minister of State Jim Paice has announced the appointment of Catherine Graham-Harrison as Chair and Roger Clarke as a Non-Executive Director of the National Forest Company. The appointments will run from 1 April 2011 to 31 March 2014. Jim Paice also announced the retirement of the Dinah Nichols, CB, who has chaired the National Forest Company for the last six years. Valerie Owen and Russ Canning also retire as Non-Executive Directors after six years’ service. These appointments have been made in accordance with guidance issued by the Office for the Commissioner for Public Appointments (OCPA). Political activity plays no part in the selection process. The National Forest Company is a non-departmental public body that was established in 1995 to lead the creation of The National Forest in the English Midlands. To date over seven million trees have been planted which has resulted in woodland cover increasing from six per cent to nearly 18 per cent across the 200 square miles covered by the Forest. Notes to Editors The National Forest Company leads the creation of The National Forest, working in partnership with landowners, local authorities, private business, voluntary organisations and local communities and has strong support from Government, politicians and the public. The Company, which celebrated its tenth anniversary in 2005, receives grant in aid from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. The National Forest area covers 200 square miles of the counties of Leicestershire, Derbyshire and Staffordshire. Its objective is to increase woodland cover within its boundaries from an initial six per cent to about one third. No multi-purpose forest on this scale has been created in the UK for one thousand years. To date the proportion of woodland cover in the Forest has already nearly trebled to almost 18 per cent and over seven million trees have been planted. Year by year, The National Forest has been steadily turning what was once one of the least wooded areas of England into a multi-purpose, sustainable forest. The National Forest provides environmental, social and economic benefits, including landscape enhancement, creation of new wildlife habitats and major new access and leisure opportunities. It is an excellent example of sustainable development - with environmental improvement providing a stimulus both to economic regeneration and to community pride and activity.

/government/news/fish-for-life-wins-prestigious-award-for-youngs,"Fish for Life was initiated in 2006 by Young's Seafood and has since been adopted across Findus Group's operations in continental Europe. Fish for Life wins prestigious award for Youngs  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Young’s the fish producer, part of Findus group, was yesterday announced as the winner of the European Business Awards for the Environment for their ‘Fish for Life’ programme for sustainably sourcing fish for their range of products. Fish for Life was selected for these finals by a European jury and was the only British entry to reach the pan-European stage out of eleven UK winners named in London in March. It won the overall prize in the ‘Management’ section of the awards, against two other entries from Austria and Turkey. Richard Benyon Defra minister for Fisheries said: “This is an excellent achievement for Young’s and recognises their hard work in using sustainable fish in their products. Conservation and support for the fishing industry must work hand-in-hand if we are to have a thriving UK fishing industry and a vibrant marine environment. UK fishermen are leading the way in improving sustainability. We will continue to work with the industry, including Young’s to deliver sustainable and profitable fisheries.” “Everyone at Defra would like to offer our congratulations to Young’s on their outstanding success at the European Business Awards for the Environment and hope that the lead Young’s have taken in sustainably sourcing their fish can be replicated across the industry.” Chris Britton, CEO of the Findus Group, said: - “These are highly prestigious awards which put Fish for Life amongst the very best environmental initiatives in Europe.  Winning this award underlines the point that Fish for Life is much more than just a consumer label for our products - it is a committed and multi-faceted programme intended to support genuine improvement in fish sustainability.” Background Fish for Life was initiated in 2006 by Young’s Seafood and has since been adopted across Findus Group’s operations in continental Europe.   It encompasses detailed criteria and a stringent assessment process to ensure that all fish is responsibly sourced and highlighted as such on Young’s and Findus packs through the Fish for Life logo.  The programme also drives extensive engagement work with fisheries to support best practice in the drive for long term sustainability. For the past ten years the  Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce (RSA) Forum has managed the process for entry into the EBAE on behalf of Defra and the UK has had at least one winner in every round since then. Defra re-launched the RSA Forum in September last year as part of its tenth anniversary.

/government/news/potato-blighted-by-ignorance,"Potato Day is an opportunity to clear up some of the myths around potatoes. Potato blighted by ignorance  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Food and Farming Minister, Jim Paice, will be celebrating Potato Day on 14 October with a visit to Frogmary Green Farm in Somerset, a farm which works to educate children about potatoes. Potato Day is an opportunity to clear up some of the myths around potatoes. Potatoes are increasingly being knocked off menus by time-conscious younger cooks who don’t appreciate their nutritional value; over the past 20 years there has been a 40 per cent drop in the number of fresh potatoes eaten in British homes. Jim Paice said: “Potato Day is a great opportunity to clear up the myth that potatoes are unhealthy. Potatoes are good value, versatile and healthy. Fresh potatoes don’t need to be manufactured like pasta or bread so they have less impact on the planet.” Jim Paice will join local children from South Petherton Junior School in South Petherton, Somerset as they see how potatoes grow and learn how to prepare a healthy potato dish. Potatoes are a great source of energy, fibre, vitamins C, B1 and B6 including folic acid and potassium, magnesium, iron and zinc. However a recent survey by the Potato Council revealed that: one in ten adults didn’t think that potatoes contained any vitamins or nutrients, less than one in five people realised that potatoes contain vitamin C. In fact, the average British person gets 15 per cent of their annual intake of vitamin C from potatoes. Nearly 3,000 potato farmers grow over six million tonnes of potatoes in Britain each year, the majority of which are eaten here in Britain. When asked, more than 80 per cent of consumers want to support home-grown food, but there is some confusion about what British farmers produce. Half of consumers think rice is being grown in Britain, and three quarters of consumers think that British farmers grow wheat for pasta - in fact, neither is true. Potato Day marks the launch of the Many Faces of Potatoes campaign, which aims to tackle misconceptions amongst younger consumers and show that potatoes can be convenient and healthy. The potato industry is benefiting from European Union funding following a joint application by the UK, France and Belgium for a campaign to promote fresh potatoes. Notes Statistics taken from One Poll Survey of 2,000 respondents conducted online June 2010 conducted on behalf of Potato Council, a division of the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board. Potato Day, organised by Potato Council, marks the start of the Many Faces of Potatoes campaign: a European programme for the generic promotion of fresh potatoes across Great Britain, France and Belgium which has received EU co-financing with the following organisations: * AHDB, Potato Council division, for United Kingdom (Great Britain) * CNIPT for France * VLAM for Flanders (Belgium) * APAQ-W for Wallonia (Belgium) More information on the health value of potatoes is available at www.eatwell.gov.uk/healthydiet/nutritionessentials/starchfoods/"

/government/news/fishermen-to-join-forces-to-keep-their-communities-afloat,"Fishing communities struggling to survive could benefit from a new cooperative scheme to keep England's inshore fishing fleet afloat.  Fishermen to join forces to keep their communities afloat  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Fishermen are being asked to join forces and take control over how they manage their fishing quotas and market their catches. Launching the pilots Fisheries Minister Richard Benyon said: “The inshore fishing fleet helps to support local communities with both money and jobs. But the industry is being stifled by an outdated system and this has to be fixed. “To survive fishermen must become more profitable and we think the answer is giving them greater control over how they fish and market their catches. They’ve asked us to test options, and that’s what these pilot projects are all about.” For the first time, pilots groups mainly made up of small boats under 10 metres long, will be able to manage a separate quota of fish. This will be based on the fish they’ve landed collectively over recent years. Some extra quota will also be available if organisations representing England’s larger boats volunteer part of their allocation. Where this is not the case, the pilot groups will get extra quota for specific species where quotas increase next year because stocks are healthier. Fishermen who don’t wish to take part in the pilots will continue to access quota through a central pool. This pool will be topped up by quota that has been consistently under exploited by other parts of the fleet. Mr Benyon added: “There are still some difficult decisions ahead for the industry, both in terms of the overall fleet size and structure, and how quota is allocated across the entire fishing fleet. “It will take compromise and I call on all sides to work together to make this happen and make this a success.”’ The pilots are part of the Government’s response to a consultation on reforming the inshore fleet’s management. They will be supported by Coastal Liaison Officers, funded through the European Fisheries Fund, who will help them market catches to maximise profit. Defra will also work with the New Under Ten Fishermens Association (NUFTA) to explore its idea for an inshore producer organisation to manage the inshore fleet’s quota. Notes The full summary of responses to the consultation and details of the other measures we have announced can be found at: http://www.defra.gov.uk/consult/2011/04/05/fisheries-1104/ More information on how to take part in the pilots is available at: http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/marine/manage/saif/ . All expressions of interest should be registered by close on Friday 18th November. The reform applies to England only since fisheries is a devolved matter."
/government/news/sky-lanterns-cause-bonfire-night-nuisance-for-farm-animals,"Bonfire Night revellers are being reminded to think about the problems which sky lanterns can cause before using them.  Speaking to the Women… Sky lanterns cause Bonfire Night nuisance for farm animals  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Bonfire Night revellers are being reminded to think about the problems which sky lanterns can cause before using them. Speaking to the Women’s Food and Farming Union today, Environment Secretary Caroline Spelman explained how sky lanterns can seriously injure or even kill cattle because the animals sometimes eat the lanterns’ wireframes. There is also the problem of litter caused when the smouldering remnants of lanterns fall into farmers’ fields. Mrs Spelman said: “Sky lanterns can look beautiful on their way up but they can cause real damage to animals when they come down. I don’t want to stop anyone’s enjoyment on Bonfire Night but I’d ask them to think about the harm sky lanterns can cause.” The Environment Secretary also spoke of the distress that fireworks can cause animals at this time of year and highlighted some advice for animal lovers to prevent their pets from suffering. Mrs Spelman added: “We all enjoy a good fireworks display but sadly many animals don’t, because their heightened senses mean that the loud bangs and whistles can cause actual pain in their ears. Animal owners can help to reduce stress for their pets by following a few simple tips such as keeping cats, dogs, rabbits and guinea pigs inside or by keeping horses stabled.” Bonfire Night falls at a time when many wild animals begin to search for somewhere to hibernate for the winter. Before setting fire to their bonfires, people should check for any wildlife such as hedgehogs which may have chosen to hibernate there. Notes More detailed advice on pet care over Bonfire Night is available on the Defra website: http://www.defra.gov.uk/wildlife-pets/pets/cruelty/ Caroline Spelman was speaking today at the Women’s Food and Farming Union Conference at HSBC Tower in Canary Wharf."

A million more trees by 2015: Defra pledge on track  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs To mark the first anniversary of the Big Tree Plant, Agriculture and Forestry Minister Jim Paice took part in a tree planting event at Maiden Lane Estate, Camden, today.  He joined local residents and the London Wildlife Trust, who were awarded Big Tree Plant funding, to create a community orchard for the local neighbourhood to enjoy.  The Big Tree Plant is helping urban communities across England plant trees in areas that need them most.  Trees in cities not only make a community come to life but can also help fight the effects of air pollution and climate change. They attract wildlife, make an area look more appealing and help create areas in which people enjoy living.  Speaking about the campaign’s success, Jim Paice said:  “It’s only a year since we launched the Big Tree Plant and we are already on target to plant one million trees by April 2015.   “So many people have got involved, planting new trees in England’s urban areas, and creating neighbourhoods to be proud of.  The campaign has already seen over 100,000 trees planted, with another  400,000 pledged to follow.”  Supporting the campaign, President of Civic Voice, Griff Rhys Jones said:  “Trees are one of the essentials of life. Our streets and public spaces need more trees and Civic Voice is a strong supporter of the Big Tree Plant so communities can green their local area. With the support of the Big Tree Plant we can all get together with civic societies and other community groups to improve the local environment for everyone. Plant a tree and you change the future. The future will thank you for it.”  Through the Big Tree Plant, Defra, the Forestry Commission and a number partners will continue to support community groups and organisations wishing to plant and care for trees in urban areas.  The campaign is supported by grant funding of £4 million, of which there is still £1.96 million left to spend.  People or groups that are interested in planting trees can apply for grant funding to help establish or expand tree planting projects.  Notes  Details of the campaign can be found at: http://www.defra.gov.uk/bigtreeplant/ .

/government/news/uk-secures-victory-in-eu-fisheries-negotiations,"The UK Government has today secured a victory for the fishing industry by stopping a massive cut in the number of days that fishermen are allowed to spend at sea. UK secures victory in EU fisheries negotiations  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs UK fishermen were facing devastating reductions to the amount of time they could spend at sea catching their quota as part of the Cod Recovery Plan. The threatened reductions not only put in jeopardy the livelihoods of UK fishermen but would have also led to increased discards. However, following three weeks of protracted discussions culminating in two days of intense negotiations, the Government successfully convinced the EU Commission that the UK approach to conservation was the right way forward. Fishermen in all countries will still face an expected reduction in the amount of time they are allowed to fish but this concession from the commission will allow the UK to develop more conservation measures and provide incentives for fishermen to take them up. To ensure the future of cod in our seas, the Government will also build on its work with the fishing industry to adopt further measures to protect cod stocks and reduce discards. During the talks the EU also agreed to increase the total allowable catch for a number of fish species. This will mean that many fishermen will find that they are allowed to catch more fish next year than they were allowed under current quotas. Speaking from Brussels, Richard Benyon, Minister for the Natural Environment and Fisheries, said: “After two days of tense and frustrating negotiations I am delighted to have secured the best deal possible for the UK fishing industry and ensure the future sustainability of our fish stocks. “By arguing that we should follow scientific advice we have been able to agree quotas that will not only allow local fishermen to make a living but will also ensure that we can protect the environment. “One of my primary goals was to see off the threat of excessive reductions in days at sea which would have put key UK fisheries at risk.” Following two days of extensive negotiations the UK also successfully negotiated a number of further concessions. These include: Staving off dramatic cuts of up to 25% to a number of important fish quotas by providing sound scientific evidence to the Council; Increasing the amount of Haddock that can be caught off the West coast of Scotland by 200%; Protecting the fishing industry in Northern Ireland by securing the same quota of scampi as last year; Increased quotas for fishermen in the following areas: North East - 100% Herring, 15% Haddock,15% Whiting South East - 15% Sole and 15% Plaice Channel - 9% Sole South West - 150% Cod, 25% Haddock, 15% Whiting"

Weymouth coastal access route to be open in time for Olympic sailing  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Those hoping to catch a glimpse of the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Sailing events have been given a boost today after the Environment Minister Richard Benyon approved the first stretch of the England Coastal Path at Weymouth Bay. The route, which will start at Rufus Castle in Portland and will end at Lulworth Cove, will improve access to 32 kilometres of the British coastline for everyone’s enjoyment and will allow those interested in spotting the Olympic Sailing to do so as they make their way along the path. Environment Minister Richard Benyon said: “Opening up miles of English Coastline like this will allow thousands of people to better enjoy this spectacular coastline and help support local economies by encouraging tourism. “I want to see more people walking in and accessing our countryside as I know the value such activity has for our health, for our economy and for the spiritual uplift and well-being that comes from being out and about in the countryside. “This will be the first stretch of England’s coastline to be accessed under the new coastal access provisions and it will be ready in time for the 2012 Games so people will have greater opportunities to enjoy the coastline and see the sailing events.” The Environment Minister was also on hand today to congratulate Natural England who have been awarded the Inspire Mark by the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games for its detailed work along this stretch of the South West Coast Path. Natural England’s Chair, Poul Christensen said; “This first stretch of the England Coast Path - which has been awarded the prestigious Inspire Mark by the London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games - will provide a legacy for everyone to enjoy new areas of Dorset’s stunning coastline. We are enormously grateful for the advice, knowledge and expertise that Dorset County Council,  local landowners and local people have provided to make this happen.” County council leader Angus Campbell said: “Dorset’s wonderful coast is one of its greatest assets.  Dorset County Council has worked closely with Natural England to secure the extra benefits that the new coastal access rights will bring for residents, visitors and businesses. An improved alignment in places, coupled with the ability to roll back the path in response to erosion, will add to the recreational, economic and health benefits that the South West Coast Path already offers.  We are delighted that this stretch will be established as the very first section of the England Coast Path.” Notes Further to the coastal access path in Weymouth, Natural England have already started work on implementing coastal access in a further five areas: * Cumbria - Whitehaven to Allonby * Hartlepool/Durham/Sunderland - North Bents (Whitburn Bay) to Seaton Carew * Norfolk -  Weybourne to Sea Palling  * Kent - Ramsgate to Folkestone  * Somerset -  Minehead to Brean Down near Weston Super Mare.  Two sections of the path in the Weymouth Bay area will be closed from mid July to mid September for security reasons but temporary alternative routes will be in place and people will be able to enjoy the rest of the coastal path during the Olympic Games."

/government/news/clampdown-on-dangerous-dogs,"Approximately 210,000 people a year are attacked by dogs in England alone, including 4,000 postal workers trying to deliver mail. Clampdown on dangerous dogs  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Dangerous dogs and the people who fail to control them face a new clampdown in order to protect the public, Defra Minister of State Jim Paice revealed today. Approximately 210,000 people a year are attacked by dogs in England alone, including 4,000 postal workers trying to deliver mail. There have been five fatal dog attacks in homes since 2007 - four of them on children - and hospital admissions for serious dog bites have more than doubled over the past decade. The Government is therefore extending existing dangerous dogs laws to any private property, closing a loophole in the current criminal law which only covers public land. There will also be a short consultation on how to introduce more comprehensive micro-chipping of dogs, as called for by major animal charities and many members of the public. In addition there will be more support for the police, councils and charities dealing with irresponsible owners and dangerous dogs. Jim Paice said: “We are known as a nation of animal lovers who take proper care of our pets. But there are a minority of irresponsible dog owners who don’t. These people allow their dogs to menace or even attack innocent members of the public. This has to stop. “We’ve all heard the stories of snarling dogs not being properly kept under control or heard from health workers, postal workers or social workers who are at risk of serious injury from out of control dogs while just doing their job, attending to people in their homes. “Today we are announcing a comprehensive package of measures that tackle the problem head on, which will better protect legitimate visitors to private property and will enable the police to take action before someone is hurt or killed.” The plans also put forward proposals to allow the police, when dealing with any dogs which are subject to proceedings under the Dangerous Dogs Act, to take a  common sense decision as to whether the dog really needs to be kept away from their owners until the outcome of proceedings. Jim Paice added: “Our plans must strike the right balance between protecting the public from dangerous dogs and ensuring that safe and properly looked after pets don’t need to be wrenched from their home unnecessarily. “We’re giving the police more discretion to take common-sense decisions where dogs are clearly not a threat by ending the requirement that they be seized and kennelled, at great cost to the taxpayer and distress to the owner involved, while a decision is taken on whether to exempt the dog from being destroyed under the Dangerous Dogs Act.” Defra’s proposals are:  Extending dangerous dog laws to all private property - without penalising the owners of animals that defend them against trespassers; Consulting on whether to micro-chip all dogs to help tackle the problem of irresponsible owners and ease the overwhelming number of strays that are put down as the owner cannot be identified; Giving the police more discretion to take common sense decisions by ending an anomaly requiring dogs be seized and kennelled, at great cost to the taxpayer and distress to the owner and dog involved, while a decision is taken on whether to exempt the dog from being destroyed under the Dangerous Dogs Act; Providing £50,000 for local and community projects involving animal welfare organisations, the police, local authorities and community groups to promote more responsible dog ownership in estates, youth clubs and schools; Providing £20,000 for the training of expert police dog legislation officers in each force; Issuing new guidance to help the courts deal more effectively with seized dogs. In addition, in order to improve consistency of sentencing the Sentencing Council, has been consulting on the sentences available to courts for owners of dangerous dogs, especially those who allow their animals to attack, and the Home Office has been examining measures to tackle anti-social behaviour. Notes to Editors Details of the consultation can be found here: www.defra.gov.uk/consult/2012/04/23/dangerous-dogs-1204/ .  The Dangerous Dogs Act allows owners of dogs that attack people to be prosecuted, with the maximum penalty a £5,000 fine or two years imprisonment. The Government is extending this to cover attacks which happen on any private property. NHS hospital admissions for dog bites more than doubled from 2,915 in 1997/98 to 6,118 in 2010, costing the NHS £3.3million. The number of dogs seized by the Metropolitan Police rose by half from 719 in 2008/09 to 1,100 in 2009/10. 84% of respondees to a public consultation in 2010 wanted to see micro-chipping of dogs made compulsory. 58% of dog owners have already had their dogs micro-chipped voluntarily. Many animal charities offer to micro-chip dogs for free or at reduced rates for those on low incomes. Private veterinary practices will charge around £20. This compares to £70 for the cost of vaccinating a puppy and £18 for a worming treatment. Current Dangerous Dogs legislation bans four dog types - Pit Bull Terrier, Japanese Tosa, Dogo Argentino and Fila Brasileiro. The Metropolitan Police alone spend  £2.75m each year on kennelling dangerous dogs, both these banned types and any dogs dangerously out of control. The Sentencing Council recently consulted on proposals about how the owners of dangerous dogs should be sentenced by the courts. The Sentencing Guidelines are due to be released in mid-May 2012 due to come into force 3 months later in August 2012."
/government/news/better-protection-for-workers-from-criminal-gangmasters,"The GLA will remove unnecessary regulatory burdens and costs for responsible employers. Better protection for workers from criminal gangmasters  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Vulnerable workers will be better protected from criminal gangmasters under plans to clamp down on unscrupulous operators, Agriculture Minister Jim Paice announced today. The Gangmasters Licensing Authority (GLA), which was set-up in 2005 to protect temporary workers from exploitation in farming, shellfish gathering, and food processing, will refocus its efforts to stamp out abuses. By freeing-up resources for inspectors to take action where it is needed most, the GLA will clamp down on high-risk labour providers who commit serious crime. It will also work more effectively with other agencies to track and address cases of human trafficking. The GLA will remove unnecessary regulatory burdens and costs for responsible employers. It will also no longer regulate certain low-risk sectors where there are far fewer vulnerable workers or evidence of any criminal gangmaster operations. Mr Paice said: “This Government is committed to protecting vulnerable workers which is why we’ll be using a much more targeted approach to clamp down on the high-risk, criminal labour providers and users where action is most needed. “Responsible employers who play by the rules will be freed from unnecessary costs and bureaucracy, allowing them to get on with the important job of running their business, while safeguarding the rights of their workers.” Under the changes, the GLA will: Focus far more on gross abuse of workers by unscrupulous gangmasters committing multiple offences  such as tax evasion, human trafficking, health and safety negligence  and other serious crimes; Work in a  more joined-up way  with a range of specialist law enforcement agencies using  an intelligence-led approach to better target and pursue suspected serious and organised crime; Make sure the evidence it collects is used in wider prosecutions of organised crime groups and assist in the earlier identification of the victims of human trafficking; Streamline the licence application process, including no longer automatically making compulsory inspections of businesses when they first apply; Look to reduce licence fees and extend the licensing period from twelve months to two years or more for highly compliant businesses; No longer regulate proven low-risk sectors, such as apprenticeships, forestry, specialist cleaning contract companies, land agents and voluntary workers; Allow shellfish “farm” businesses with exclusive rights to use the seashore for shellfish cultivation to use their workers to grade and gather shellfish stock without needing to be licensed as a gangmaster. This is because these permanent businesses do not use gangmasters to supply workers, and instead employ staff under strict regulations from specific permits.  This measure would leave activities such as the gathering of cockles from public shellfish beds, where gangmasters operate, fully within the GLA’s remit; Substitute administrative fines and penalties for low-level and technical minor offences, including a measure similar to a Repayment Order to achieve rapid reimbursement to an exploited worker of wages or other payment which has been removed; Explore the use of alternatives to prosecution when taking enforcement action against a labour user who uses an unlicensed gangmaster; Amend the structure of GLA Board and make it smaller to provide clear, strategic leadership and direction to the GLA so that it can be more effective. Welcoming the changes, GLA chair Margaret McKinlay said: “GLA plays a vital role in protecting the interests of vulnerable workers. We welcome these changes which will really help us focus our efforts on the areas of high risk activity that will make a difference, while reducing the burdens for compliant businesses. “We’ve already been looking to apply a light touch approach to licensing the businesses we regulate and have started to focus our efforts on areas where exploitation of workers may be more of a problem.” The changes to the operation are following the Government’s Red Tape Challenge. Defra will now work up detailed proposals and consult on them within the next year, taking into account the outstanding Department for Business Innovation and Skills’ review of Workplace Compliance and Enforcement Rights.

/government/news/ending-abuse-of-village-green-legislation-will-unlock-growth-and-boost-aspiration,"Plans in the Growth Bill will ensure communities can develop land in their areas and no longer be overruled by an abuse of Town and Village Green legislation. Ending abuse of village green legislation will unlock growth and boost aspiration  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs New plans in today’s Growth Bill will ensure communities that wish to see land developed in their areas will no longer be overruled by an abuse of Town and Village Green legislation. Current legislation means that building work that has been granted planning permission or is undergoing community consultation can be delayed while the legal process of considering a Town and Village Green (TVG) application takes place.  It is possible for houses to be built, bought and even lived in before a TVG application is made, leaving residents with great uncertainty as to the future of their homes. Abuse of TVG legislation means that some communities have to wait for years to discover whether there will be new housing or job opportunities in their local area. In the right place, these developments are key to helping more aspiring people on to the housing ladder and giving businesses a better chance to grow. Costs to taxpayers, land owners and local investors can run into millions of pounds while a TVG application goes through the courts.  The current legislation also serves as a disincentive to investment in areas which communities wish to see developed. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson said: “Town and village greens are cherished community spaces, and it’s absolutely right they continue to have the strongest protection. “Yet the system can be abused to stop developments like affordable housing from being built. We’re stamping down on the abuse of this law that can effectively shut local communities out of deciding what development is right for them. This Government has a vital mission to support growth and spread aspiration, and these new plans will help that to happen.” Reform will protect local communities’ ability to determine what development is appropriate in their areas by preventing TVG applications overriding decisions made following local consultation on plans. The new approach will prevent TVG applications when an application for planning permission has been made or granted, and when land has been allocated for development by the local authority. There are already well over 4,000 existing TVGs and they will retain full protection.  TVGs can continue to be registered where no development is either proposed or the subject of ongoing community consultation. Under the plans, private landowners who wish to allow some public use of their land will now be able to do so without jeopardising its value or future development potential.  Currently, if a landowner does not challenge public use of his or her land for a period of twenty years, any future use for business, farming or development use may be ruled out by a TVG registration. Financial savings from the changes are likely to run to many millions in the short term, and significantly more in the longer term.  This includes savings to local authorities, developers and landowners through cuts to legal fees, public enquiry costs and costs resulting from devaluation of land and delays. Longer term financial benefits will arise from increased certainty around how local land will be used, social improvements and economic growth from jobs and development. The reforms to the legislation are expected to come into force by summer 2013. Notes to editors Further information on the Town and Village Greens reforms can be found at: http://www.defra.gov.uk/rural/protected/greens/ . Town and Village Greens are the most protected landscape designation in England.  Legislation allows greens to be registered to secure them permanent protection as community spaces. Historically, TVG applications were registered at a rate of around 60 per year, but in some years since 2000 this as risen to nearly 200, placing a significant burden on local authorities.  Many of the local authorities that assess the applications have an interest in the land in question, and as a result many applications need to be decided by a court. Case studies where TVG delays have adversely affected the local community include (based on information sent to Defra as part of the consultation): In Saham Toney, Norfolk , Hastoe Group built ten houses on a piece of land which had been farmed for centuries by a local family that wished the site to be used for affordable housing.  The use of the field for local housing had been consulted on and there had been an overall positive response from the local community.  After the homes had been built, a TVG application was lodged. Two and a half years later the housing residents, owners, and Hastoe are still awaiting an outcome, with the combined legal fees to Hastoe, the landowner and the taxpayer sitting at a reported £50k. Warneford Meadow is an 8.5 hectare area of land in east Oxford. It was registered as a village green in April 2010.  The Friends of Warneford Meadow, which submitted the application, say that total cost of the process exceeded £0.5m, and possibly cost as much as £1m.  The owner has not been able to develop the land and the value of the land has plummeted from £11 million, now being valued at £500,000. In Marsh Gibbon , a fifteen acre field had allegedly been farmed for 200 hundred years so was at no point being used, in the traditional sense, as a village green.  Nonetheless, the building of eight new houses was delayed by 2.5 years by a TVG application.  In February 2008, eight affordable homes received planning permission following community consultation on the proposed development.  In March 2008, when a building contract had been made, a local pressure group ‘Keep it Green’ applied to Buckinghamshire County Council (BCC) to have the site registered as a Village Green.  The matter was heard at a public inquiry which was eventually held in mid 2010.  The hearing lasted one day and the inspector found that the application failed to satisfy any of the tests set out in Section 15 of the Commons Act and therefore rejected the application - 2.5 years after the construction had been due to start.  Unrecoverable costs to Hastoe: £157,859; Unrecoverable costs to Ewelme Charity: (which owns the remainder of the field) £14,000 (circa); unrecoverable costs to Bucks County Council: £15,000; further unrecoverable costs to Hastoe if the application had been successful: £76,947. In addition to the above, if the application had been successful 10-12 construction jobs would have been lost along with homes that will house 26 local people.  In** Buxton , a **town and village green application held back the potential for the town’s economic growth by frustrating plans for new employment land.  It also held up the development of new leisure facilities and 575 new homes.  High Peak Council spent a reported £100,000 in legal advice contesting the registration of a new green in the High Court.

/government/news/uk-to-lead-way-on-sustainable-palm-oil,"By the end of 2015 all palm oil used in central Government food and catering services will come from environmentally friendly sources, Environment… UK to lead way on sustainable palm oil  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs By the end of 2015 all palm oil used in central Government food and catering services will come from environmentally friendly sources, Environment Minister Richard Benyon announced today. Government, supermarkets, manufacturers, charities and WWF have also joined forces to work towards ensuring that, by 2015, all palm oil used in everyday food and products such as soaps, biscuits and cosmetics is responsibly-produced and does not contribute to deforestation. Environment Minister Richard Benyon said: “The Government is leading the way by ensuring that only environmentally friendly sourced palm oil is used in its central food and catering services. This is great news for wildlife and forests around the world. “People want to know that the products they are using are not contributing to deforestation and climate change and many UK businesses are already starting to make changes. Producers, manufacturers and charities will continue working together to speed up the move to 100% sustainable palm oil in everyday products.” This announcement comes as the International Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil annual conference takes place in Singapore from 29-31 October. The Government will also set up an advice and information service to help UK businesses and government procurers work towards 100% sustainable palm oil. This includes a helpline, web pages, newsletters and seminars. Latest figures show that in 2011 the UK imported 450,000 tonnes of palm oil and palm kernel oil. Food and Drink Federation Director of Sustainability Andrew Kuyk, said: “Many food and drink manufacturers have in place long-standing commitments to using 100% certified sustainable palm oil and the national statement is an important step towards a wider reassurance for consumers that the products they enjoy contain oil from environmentally friendly sources. “We have seen significant progress towards achieving this aim since the first shipment of RSPO-certified sustainable palm oil arrived in November 2008 and we believe the joint agreement will encourage increased uptake by British industry.” Palm oil and palm kernel oil are used in the food industry as frying fats and as ingredients in a wide range of foods such as biscuits, margarine, snacks and bakery products. They are also used in the production of biodiesel, in animal feed, and soaps and other cleaning products and cosmetics. Notes to Editors: The Government, oil processors and distributors, food and drink manufacturers, retailers, animal feed manufacturers, hospitality sector, renewable energy sector, cleaning products industry, speciality chemicals sector and World Wildlife Fund UK (WWF), have all stated their ambition to source 100% sustainable palm oil by 2015. The joint statement is published here http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/natural/deforestation/ . The Government Buying Standard for Food and Catering is available here http://sd.defra.gov.uk/2011/06/new-government-buying-standards-for-food-and-catering/ .

It is available here:  http://wwf.panda.org/what_we_do/footprint/agriculture/palm_oil/solutions/responsible_purchasing/scorecard2011/ . Changes to food labelling will make it easier for consumers to identify which products contain palm oil. Changes to the European Food Information Regulations will mean labels have to identify the specific types of vegetable oils that have been used. Businesses are already starting to implement the change, and it will be mandatory on all food products from 13 December 2014. There is more information about the European Food Information for Consumers Regulations available here http://ec.europa.eu/food/food/labellingnutrition/foodlabelling/proposed_legislation_en.htm .

/government/news/outdated-farm-labour-laws-abolished,"Agricultural Wages Board (AWB) to be scrapped Outdated farm labour laws abolished  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Outdated and bureaucratic farm labour restrictions will be abolished as early as next next year, Farming Minister David Heath announced today. Defra’s plans to scrap the Agricultural Wages Board (AWB) - a panel setting pay which was abolished in all other sectors almost 20 years ago - were today included in a bill going through Parliament. It will mean that the law governing agricultural wages will be harmonised with the rest of the economy. This will end an anomaly requiring farmers to follow outdated and bureaucratic rules dating back to the beginning of the 20th Century. Mr Heath said: “Scrapping these outdated and bureaucratic rules will significantly reduce burdens to farmers while keeping workers extremely well protected. “I’m convinced it’s the right move to help agriculture take advantage of the huge opportunities to prosper in coming years.” Research shows that in line with the Government’s work to reduce bureaucracy in the food and farming industry , farmers will save significant time, effort and costs in no longer meeting two sets of legislation. This will lead to a more flexible market and make it far easier for employees to receive annual salaries, rather than hourly wages, in line with modern personal finance arrangements. The AWB sets minimum wage rates for six categories of agricultural workers in England and Wales. Under it, the current minimum wage is just two pence higher than the National Minimum Wage, but most workers already receive pay above the wage minimums. The plans were today added as an amendment to the Department for Business Industry and Skill’s Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Bill at Lords Committee stage. The decision was made after Defra carefully considered responses to its consultation, published today . Abolition of the board will depend on the passage of the bill through Parliament, but it is hoped the National Minimum Wage will apply to agricultural workers from 1 October 2013."

/government/news/success-for-the-uk-at-eu-fish-negotiations,"The UK Government has secured a deal that is good for both the health of our seas and the UK fishing industry at this year’s annual round of… Success for the UK at EU fish negotiations  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs The UK Government has secured a deal that is good for both the health of our seas and the UK fishing industry at this year’s annual round of fisheries talks. In negotiations that went through the night and into the morning, the UK managed to fight huge cuts to quotas across a number of different fish stocks. These proposed cuts, which the UK successfully pushed back against, were not backed up by scientific evidence, and could have contributed to an increase in the discarding of perfectly edible fish. This positive news follows another major success, achieved during the first day of negotiations, when the UK successfully stopped a cut in the number of days that fishermen are allowed to spend fishing at sea. Before these negotiations began, UK fishermen faced the prospect of having the number of days they could spend fishing cut by a quarter. However the UK government overturned this agreement, made as part of the Cod Recovery Plan. Scientific advice showed that these automatic reductions were only serving to increase cod mortality and discards, rather than help conserve stocks. Without this agreement many fishermen would not have had the necessary time available to get to where cod fishing would prove most sustainable and may have been forced to target young fish closer to shore. While the quota for cod in 2013 will be decided in January, Fisheries Minister Richard Benyon will be arguing against the Commissions proposed 20% cut, and instead will be calling for the quota to be set based on scientific evidence to recover the stock by 2015 whilst also working to significantly reduce discards. Speaking from Brussels, Richard Benyon, Minister for the Natural Environment and Fisheries, said: “This has been my third year attending these frustrating negotiations and I am delighted that we were able to secure the best possible deal for the UK fishing industry. “The current Cod Recovery Plan has failed to deliver. It was my one of my priorities to ensure that days at sea for fishermen would remain the same next year and that is exactly what has been achieved. “I always enter these discussions clear in my mind that any decisions on quotas, or days spent at sea, need to be based on three clear principles; following scientific advice, fishing sustainability and the need for continued discard reduction. We stuck to these principles throughout.” The UK also successfully negotiated a number of further concessions. These include: Days at sea kept at 2012 levels rather than reduced. Removed threat to continued success of the catch quota trial by taking away proposed restrictions on the movement of quota. Fighting off large cuts to a number of important fish quotas, including data poor stocks, by providing sound scientific evidence to the Council including: Celtic Sea: 55% cut to Haddock reduced to 15% South West: 20% cut to Megrim avoided West of Scotland: 40% cut to megrim reduced to 7% Increased quotas for fishermen in many areas, including the  following: Channel: 26% Plaice; 6% Sole West of Scotland & Irish Sea: 18% and 6% Nephrops Celtic Sea: 29% Whiting Irish Sea: 5% Herring"
/government/speeches/late-night-drinking-dealing-with-the-problems-response-to-the-consultation,"Statement was laid in the House of Lords on 4 July 2012 by Lord Henley, and in the House of Commons by James Brokenshire. Late Night Drinking; dealing with the problems : response to the consultation   Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs The response to the consultation on the secondary legislation for the late-night levy and early morning alcohol restriction orders has been published today. The late-night levy and early morning alcohol restriction orders (EMROs) are two alcohol measures in the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011. The extension of EMROs will allow local councils to restrict the sale of alcohol in their local area flexibly between 12am and 6am. This is a tool that licensing authorities can use to prevent problems in the night-time economy in either a part or the whole of their area. The late night levy will fulfil our commitment to allow councils to levy a charge from those selling alcohol late at night in their area to help contribute towards high policing costs in the late night economy. Again, it can be applied flexibly between 12am and 6am. These measures will empower local communities to act to achieve a more viable night time economy and contribute to the Government’s Alcohol Strategy to turn the tide against irresponsible drinking. The response to the ‘Dealing with the problems of late night drinking’ consultation considers the various comments received from a wide range of respondents. Their views have contributed to the development of the regulations that detail how these policies will be implemented. The first of these regulations have been laid today. Copies of the response to the consultation will be placed in the House Library and it is also available on the Home Office website . Wednesday, 4 July 2012 Date: Wed Jul 04 11:06:58 BST 2012"
/government/speeches/asylum-and-migration-fund-and-the-internal-security-fund-police-uk-opt-in,"Statement on the provision of police air support laid in the House of Commons on 25 April 2012 by Theresa May. Asylum and Migration Fund and the Internal Security Fund (Police): UK opt-in  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs I wish to inform the House that the government has opted in to the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the Asylum and Migration Fund (AMF), and the horizontal regulation laying down the general provisions for this fund for the period 2014 to 2020. The decision has been made not to opt in to the Internal Security Fund (Police) Regulation (ISF Police) at this time. The objectives of the AMF, under the freedom, security and justice heading of the EU budget, is to contribute to an effective management of migration flows in the Union drawing together the capacity building process developed within the current EU migration funds and extending these to cover some aspects of external migration policy under the framework of the EU global approach to migration. The UK has benefitted from participation in predecessor EU funding programmes, in particular in relation to EU migration funding for returns programmes, resettlement projects and community integration projects. The current EU migration funds partly finance our charter flight programmes and have enabled the UK to expand the range of destinations and programme parameters. The UK also has a well-established resettlement programme due to the co-financing from the current EU migration funding streams. Without this funding UK Border Agency would not be able to continue the scale of resettlement activity currently undertaken. Furthermore, the current European fund for the integration of third-country nationals has become an important source of funding for third-country nationals seeking to integrate into British society. The ISF (Police) Regulation aims to establish the instrument for financial support for police cooperation, preventing and combating crime and crisis management. The decision not to opt in to the ISF (Police) was driven by the substance of the proposal as it currently stands, coupled with the overall need for budgetary constraint in this time of fiscal austerity. The UK sees value in the ISF (Police) Fund supporting practical action on police cooperation and internal security. However, we have ongoing concerns about the budgetary elements of the programme, in particular given the obligations that will arise from the arrangements for shared management. We need to be absolutely sure that the benefits we will secure from the programme outweigh the cost of participation. We will consider whether to apply to opt in post adoption when the financial commitments will be known. The horizontal regulation establishes the management procedures for both funds. In concluding that it is in our interests to opt in to the AMF, it was therefore necessary to opt in to this measure. All the proposals remain under negotiation.

Many statistics are only available at Local Authority level. In order to examine rural and urban differences and similarities for these areas, it is necessary to classify the LAs based on their rurality. The LA Classification is a ‘spectrum’, or graded system and is based on settlement type as defined by the rural/urban definition. It gives 6 Urban/Rural Classifications: major urban: districts with either 100,000 people or 50 percent of their population in urban areas with a population of more than 750,000; large urban: districts with either 50,000 people or 50 percent of their population in one of 17 urban areas with a population between 250,000 and 750,000; other urban: districts with less than 26 percent of their population in rural settlements and larger market towns; significant rural: districts with more than 26 percent of their population in rural settlements and larger market towns; rural-50: districts with at least 50 percent but less than 80 percent of their population in rural settlements and larger market towns; rural-80: districts with at least 80 percent of their population in rural settlements and larger market towns Prior to local government reorganisation in 2009, the classification used a slightly different methodology and, therefore, some local councils were classified differently. However since April 2009, for consistency the new methodology has been applied both to the new local council structure (326 councils in England) and to the old structure (354 councils).

/government/speeches/oral-ministerial-statement-outcomes-of-december-fisheries-council,"Richard Benyon, Fisheries Minister delivered the below speech to the House of Commons on Tuesday 8 January 2013. Oral Ministerial Statement: Outcomes of December Fisheries Council  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs I represented the UK at the fisheries part of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council in Brussels on 18-20 December. Richard Lochhead, Michelle O’Neill and Alun Davies attended for Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales respectively. The annual December round of negotiations for Total Allowable Catches (TACs) and Quotas is a difficult negotiation. This year was particularly challenging. UK fishermen were facing automatic 25% reductions in the time they can spend at sea, as well as significant decreases in TACs and quotas. I entered this year’s negotiation clear in my mind that decisions on quotas, or days spent at sea, need to be based on three clear principles: following scientific advice; sustainability; and the need for continued discard reduction. Mr Speaker, we adhered to these principles throughout and I am pleased to report to the House that the UK Government secured a deal that was good both for the health of our seas and the UK fishing industry. We secured agreement to end automatic reductions to the number of days fishermen can spend at sea, overcoming the legal obstacles in the Cod Recovery Plan. The number of available days in 2013 will be at the same level as 2012, giving fishermen the time to fish sustainably, avoiding discards and juvenile fish. The quota for North Sea cod in 2013 will be decided during the EU/Norway negotiations next week. We removed the requirement for this to be based on an automatic 20% reduction, instead enabling the quota to be set on the basis of scientific evidence. Reflecting the latest science the UK is calling for a rollover of the TAC to decrease discards, increase the likelihood of achieving Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) by 2015 and improving the stock biomass. This outcome, together with our success in removing proposed restrictions on discard reduction programmes, means that our highly successful and ground breaking Catch Quota scheme, which effectively eliminates discards, can continue to grow and develop this year. On fish quotas, where the scientific evidence showed that significant cuts in quota were necessary for the health of the stock we accepted them. For example: North Sea Nephrops, Celtic Sea herring and Rockall haddock. But where they were not justified we successfully managed to fight huge cuts to quotas across a number of different fish stocks. The proposed cuts to quotas were often not supported by the available evidence and would have led to an increase in the discarding of perfectly edible fish. Successes included mitigating a 55% cut in South West haddock to 15%, a 48% cut in West of Scotland haddock to 30% and overturning a 12% cut to a 6% increase in Nephrops around Northern Ireland. Because a number of stocks are improving we were able to increase quotas for them this year. For example, we secured increases in quota for plaice and sole in the Channel, Nephrops in West of Scotland and cod and whiting in the South West. We are also hoping to secure increases in many of the North Sea stocks, in line with the scientific advice, as part of the EU/Norway discussions next week. Through the night the UK team battled hard to reach an agreement that ensures the long term sustainability of fish stocks, whilst providing short term catching opportunities for our fishing industry.  The package we secured helps all sectors of the industry, large and small, and delivers benefits for all parts of the UK - north, south, east and west. This was a good result for the UK fleet and for sustainable exploitation of the fish on which our fishermen depend. It also supports our wider objectives on the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy and it was a timely coincidence that the European Parliament were voting on CFP reform at the same time that the annual quota negotiations were taking place. I was very pleased that ambitious provisions to eliminate discards, set fishing rates sustainably and allow for regional decision making were voted through. This was an important step forward for the reform process, and bodes well that the final package we will negotiate this year will include the radical reforms we all agree are needed."

Flood and coastal resilience partnership funding: an introductory guide  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs The way that government funding is allocated to flood and coastal erosion risk management projects in England is changing. The reforms aim to allow more schemes to go ahead and to give each community more of a say in what is done to protect them. The new system will begin from now for all projects seeking financial approval. Instead of meeting the full costs of just a limited number of projects, the new approach could make government money available towards any worthwhile scheme over time. Funding levels for each scheme will relate directly to the number of households protected, the damages being prevented, plus the other benefits a scheme would deliver. For the first time, grants for surface water management and property-level protection will be available alongside funding for other risks and approaches."

Antisocial behaviour, policing and crime measures unveiled  Ministry of Justice Home Office Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs A raft of measures to create new and simpler powers to tackle antisocial behaviour, make forced marriage illegal and improve professional standards of the police were introduced today in the new Antisocial Behaviour, Crime and Policing Bill . New legislation The Bill, which was outlined in the Queen’s Speech , will: condense 19 existing measures to deal with antisocial behaviour into six, more effective powers, giving victims the ability to ensure action is taken and a greater say in the sanction an offender receives; encourage responsible dog ownership by making it a criminal offence to have a dog that is dangerously out of control in a private property (extending the current legislation which covers public places); tackle the use of illegal firearms by gangs and organised crime groups, by increasing the maximum penalty for illegal importation/exportation of firearms and create a new offence of possession for sale or transfer; provide the new College of Policing with the powers it needs to set standards for the police in England and Wales; and extend the powers and remit of the Independent Police Complaints Commission to ensure all serious allegations against police officers and staff are investigated robustly and independently. Crime is falling Home Secretary Theresa May said: Police reform is working and crime continues to fall. We have swept away central targets, reduced bureaucracy and introduced Police and Crime Commissioners to make the police more accountable. Today we are delivering on our pledges to give victims of antisocial behaviour a stronger voice, further cut crime and improve the relationship between the public and police. Forced marriage The government has also taken action to strengthen the protection for victims of forced marriage by making it a criminal offence. Theresa May added: Forced marriage is little more than slavery. It is an appalling form of abuse and by criminalising it we are sending out a clear message that this brutal practice is totally unacceptable and will not be tolerated in the UK."

The Rural-Urban Definition  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs The Rural-Urban Definition was introduced in 2004 as a joint project between the Commission for Rural Communities (CRC – formerly the Countryside Agency), the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), the Office for National Statistics (ONS), the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) and the Welsh Assembly. It was delivered by the Rural Evidence Research Centre at Birkbeck College (RERC). Areas forming settlements with populations of over 10,000 are urban, as defined by ONS urban area boundaries based upon land use. The remainder are defined as rural town and fringe, village or hamlet and dispersed using detailed postcode data. These (rural) settlement types are defined using population density at different scales. Once identified these are used to characterize census units (such as Output Areas and wards). Rural town and fringe areas tend to be relatively densely populated over an extended area, whereas village and hamlet areas generally have lower population densities and smaller settled areas.

/government/news/new-measures-to-increase-rural-home-building,"Village greens to get new planning measure. New measures to increase rural home-building  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Towns and villages will now find it easier to get the development they need after changes to the village green system that will stop it being abused came in today. Village green status protects land that is regularly used for recreation but loopholes in the system have increasingly been abused by people looking to stop local development. As well as having a negative effect on the rural economy and reducing the value of land – often by over 90% – this reduces the availability of rural homes, facilities and hospitals across the country. The changes that come in today means it will no longer be possible to block local development by making spurious village green applications. While legitimate applications will remain well-protected, changes to the system will also save local authorities £1.3 million a year, as applications often lead to expensive and time-consuming public enquiries and court cases. This money can be invested in local amenities, transport and other much-needed rural provision. Businesses will also make an expected annual saving of £3.4 million, which will help boost regional job creation. Rural Affairs Minister, Richard Benyon said: Towns across the country have been held back from getting the developments they want through misuse of the village green system. Rural communities need access to services like healthcare, schools and housing just as much as urban areas. These changes will allow that infrastructure to be built, creating jobs and economic growth.” Stuart Ropke, assistant director of policy and research at the National Housing Federation, said: Rural communities are some of the hardest hit by the housing crisis. A lack of housing means young people can’t stay where they grew up and couples can’t put down roots in their village and raise a family. Local businesses such as pubs and shops, which are already struggling to stay open, face a bleak future. Building just a small number of homes will save these vibrant communities in Britain’s treasured countryside. Many want new homes, but opponents have often abused the system and attempted to declare available land a village green. Closing this loophole will help rural communities get the homes they so desperately need – housing local people, keeping schools and post offices open and helping rural communities to stay alive.” From now on, applications relating to land which is regularly used for local recreation will have to be made within a year of the land’s use, rather than two. Similarly, landowners will be encouraged to allow local communities to make use of their land, as they will be able to protect it being registered as a village green through new landowner statements. In April, the government took the first step in reducing village green abuse, by closing a loophole that made it possible to submit a village green application on land which had already been earmarked for development. These reforms form part of the Growth and Infrastructure Act 2013, following the 2010 Penfold Review. Further information Town and village greens: how to register  "

UK Government underlines importance of Scottish fishing industry‬  Scotland Office Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Peterhead, the UK’s largest white fish and pelagic port, was the venue for a visit today by Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael and the Minister for Farming, Food and Fisheries George Eustice. Peterhead has also played a significant role in the development of North Sea oil and gas over the past 35 years. Its port now hosts a full range of other cargoes and commodities including agricultural products such as grain, timber and fertiliser.‬ ‪As part of the visit the Ministers discussed the future of fishing in Scotland with the Scottish Fishermen’s Federation as well as skippers and industry representatives from the whitefish, shellfish and pelagic sectors, covering all corners of the Scottish coast and the Northern Isles. Mr Carmichael said:‬ Scotland has a proud tradition as a fishing nation and Peterhead is at the heart of that tradition. Generations of Scots have made their living from the sea and many of our remote and rural towns and villages depend on the fishing industry – as I know only too well from my own constituency of Orkney and Shetland.‬ I’m determined to ensure that fishing will be as much a part of Scotland’s future as it has been of its past. That’s why I’m working with my DEFRA colleagues to get the best possible deal for Scotland’s fishermen in Europe, while respecting the need to conserve stocks. We are fortunate to be blessed with fantastic natural resources and we must manage these sustainably.‬ Our fishermen work hard to put fish on our plates. Nobody should be in any doubt about what tough and dangerous work it can be. They deserve the government’s support for their industry and that’s what they will get from me. They deserve nothing less. Mr Eustice said: I want to work closely with fishermen so we can achieve our shared goals of a thriving fishing industry, sustainable fish stocks and a healthy marine environment. I wanted to make a visit to Scotland an early priority. There are some important negotiations in the months ahead, particularly relating to cod quotas. Reducing quotas at a time when stocks have increased would only lead to increased discards which no one wants."

Ethical palm oil rise protects endangered orang-utans  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs More than half of palm oil imported into the UK now comes from sustainable sources, a new report will show today. The report is the first review of the UK consumption of palm oil in four years and since an agreement was made in 2012 to source 100 per cent sustainable palm oil by 2015. In 2009, around 24 per cent of palm oil was sustainably sourced, but the latest figures show an increase to 52 per cent. The figures are released as Environment Minister Lord de Mauley launches the latest season of the If They’re Gone campaign to raise awareness of the threats to some of our most endangered species, such as the orang-utan. Palm oil is the world’s most used vegetable oil and is contained in food, cosmetics and soaps. However, chopping down rainforests to make room for palm oil plantations is causing catastrophic environmental damage and resulting in the loss of the orang-utans’ natural habitat. More UK businesses and charities have also signed up to protecting the natural habitat of our endangered species by committing to only using 100 per cent sustainable palm oil by 2015. Lord de Mauley said: By preserving natural habitats we can protect endangered species such as the orang-utan who are at risk due to deforestation. We’ve seen a massive decline in their numbers in recent years and the rate of their demise is set to continue rapidly unless we stop forests from being destroyed. Everyone can make a difference by buying products made with sustainable palm oil. This will help protect the environment, sustainable farmers and our precious wildlife. As part of the government’s commitment to sustainable palm oil, all food ingredients labels will have to specify when palm oil is used in a product by December 2014. The If They’re Gone campaign was launched in March 2013 and involves more than 20 organisations from key wildlife groups, zoos and safari parks.

/government/news/sustainable-fishing-uk-secures-deal-at-eu-negotiations,"George Eustice secures sustainable fishing deal for UK at annual EU talks. Sustainable fishing - UK secures deal at EU negotiations  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs The UK government has today secured a deal that is good for both the sustainability of fisheries and the UK fishing industry at this year’s annual round of EU fisheries talks. These were the first EU quota negotiations since agreeing the historic reform of the Common Fisheries Policy ( CFP ) and it has been imperative that next year’s quotas are consistent with the new CFP . This has meant taking decisions based on three clear principles: following the available scientific advice; achieving sustainable levels of fishing (known as Maximum Sustainable Yield) by 2015 where possible and by 2020 at the latest; and reducing discards. We have achieved this by securing for another year a vital freeze in the number of days fishermen can go to sea under the cod recovery plan. This gives fishermen the time they need to fish more selectively and avoid discarding perfectly good fish. The UK also successfully negotiated a number of further concessions. These include: Days at sea kept at 2013 levels rather than reduced. Reducing cuts to a number of important fish quotas by providing sound scientific evidence to the Council including: Celtic Sea: 75% cut to haddock reduced to 33% West of Scotland: 20% cut to monkfish reduced to 10% Irish Sea: 24% cut to nephrops (prawns) reduced to 9% Eastern Channel: 45% cut to sole reduced to 18% Increased quotas for fishermen in many areas, including the following: Channel: 15% monkfish; West of Scotland and Irish Sea: megrim 20%; Rockall haddock 22% Celtic Sea: 30% herring; 25% Bristol Channel plaice Irish Sea: 5% herring All UK waters: 49% hake Maintaining 2013 quotas for a number of flatfish stocks, such as lemon sole and witch. Speaking from Brussels, Fisheries Minister George Eustice said: Although these were difficult negotiations, I am pleased that we were able to secure the best possible deal for ensuring sustainable fisheries and a strong UK fishing industry. It was my top priority to ensure that days at sea for fishermen would remain the same next year and that is exactly what has been achieved. I entered these discussions with the firm belief that any decisions on quotas or days spent at sea need to be based on three clear principles; following scientific advice, fishing sustainably and the need for continued reduction in discarding. We stuck to these principles throughout.” North Sea cod quotas won’t be agreed until January 2014; however we will be pushing for a quota for cod which is consistent with achieving Maximum Sustainable Yield by 2015. There has also been broad recognition at this year’s negotiations that when dealing with mixed fisheries discards can be difficult to manage. That is why we have followed scientific advice by agreeing quotas that will reduce discards and help achieve sustainable stocks. Many fish stocks are becoming healthier but some have a longer way to go and we have accepted quota cuts where these are necessary. We are also fishing more sustainably but further work can be done to make fishing methods even more sustainable. The UK has been praised for steps we are already taking to do this – including making strong progress on the selectivity of fishing gear and implementing our catch quota schemes which eliminate discards. Other areas where we have achieved positive results include reducing the proposed cut in quota for Celtic Sea haddock and increased flexibility for fishermen to choose where they can catch monkfish. Both of these achievements will prevent discards of these stocks."

The register will also improve fisheries management by helping the fishing industry to make better use of its quota, which is a publically owned resource. FQA units are the main means by which fishing quota is allocated amongst the UK fishing industry. EU countries receive a share of the Total Allowable Catch for each quota fish stock, and within the UK these are largely distributed into what are known as FQA holdings. Each FQA gives the holder access to a share of the quota for particular fish stocks. The register was produced between all the UK fisheries administrations, the Marine Management Organisation and the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science. Fisheries Minister George Eustice said: The Fixed Quota Allocation provides greater transparency for anyone with an interest in our fishing industry by allowing them to see who has access to the UK’s fishing quota. This will also improve the management of our fisheries by allowing the fishing industry to make better use of its quota.

/government/news/tougher-enforcement-action-and-stronger-penalties-for-unscrupulous-employers,"In a crack down on illegal working, unscrupulous employers who exploit workers will face tougher enforcement action and stronger penalties. Tougher enforcement action and stronger penalties for unscrupulous employers  National Crime Agency Prime Minister's Office, 10 Downing Street Gangmasters Licensing Authority Home Office Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Unscrupulous employers who exploit workers will face tougher enforcement action and stronger penalties as part of the government’s long-term plan to ensure the economy delivers for hard-working people, the Prime Minister announced today. The Gangmasters Licensing Authority ( GLA ) will today become part of the Home Office in a move which will strengthen its enforcement and intelligence capabilities, putting it directly alongside the National Crime Agency’s ( NCA ) considerable resources to tackle the highest harm offenders. The GLA will have expert support from the NCA ’s intelligence hub which provides a single picture of all the threats from serious and economic crime. It will also be able to tap into the resources and reach of the NCA ’s 4,500 officers and its international presence in 40 countries, through national tasking and co-ordination mechanisms. The NCA has recently secured agreements with Afghanistan and Greece to tackle the movement of trafficked people, and is engaged in operations to disrupt organised crime groups involved in the illegal exploitation of workers. The Prime Minister also announced plans to tackle recruitment agencies which discriminate against UK workers by recruiting solely from abroad. The government will consult on new regulations to require these agencies to advertise vacancies in English in the UK. Prime Minister David Cameron said: A key part of our long-term plan is making sure our economy delivers for people who do the right thing, so everyone who wants to work hard can get on in life. The changes we are making today will help stop practices which exploit vulnerable workers and undercut local businesses that play by the rules. They will give workers in Britain a fair crack of the whip when it comes to getting a job themselves. That means more economic security for people across our country. Sign up for regular email updates from the Prime Minister’s Office. The new plans announced today are in addition to action the government is already taking to tackle illegal working and recruitment: new regulations to double the maximum penalty for employing illegal workers to £20,000 will come into force at the start of May 2014 increasing the maximum fine for employers paying below the National Minimum Wage from £5,000 to £20,000; primary legislation will shortly be introduced which will mean maximum penalties of up to £20,000 for each individual worker they have underpaid new regulations will be introduced in Parliament next month to increase the penalties for rogue landlords who house workers illegally in ‘beds in sheds’; for a range of housing related offences, the potential sanction will be increased to an unlimited fine £6.5 million has been made available to councils which has already resulted in the discovery of over 950 properties that were overcrowded or being used illegally updated guidance to support local authorities in identifying rogue landlords and developing a strategy to tackle them; taking decisive action and sharing best practice; prosecuting rogue landlords and achieving the strongest possible penalties; and recognising and dealing with illegal eviction will be issued in the summer the provisions in the Immigration Bill will make it harder for illegal workers to stay in the UK; powers in the Bill will ensure that landlords check the immigration status of their tenants; and will prohibit illegal immigrants from holding driving licences or bank accounts in the Modern Slavery Bill the government will aim to ensure those gangmasters who orchestrate forced servitude of workers, often trafficked here under false pretences, are caught and penalised with tough sentences to match the severity of the crime, including life imprisonment Gangmasters Licensing Authority The GLA , , was set up in 2004 to protect workers after the tragic deaths of 23 Chinese cockle pickers in Morecambe Bay. It licenses businesses which provide workers to the farming, food processing and shellfish gathering sectors to make sure they meet the employment standards required by law; and carries out inspections and enforcement activity. It was, until today (9 April), an agency of Defra. There is no change to the remit or funding of the agency. It works in partnership with other agencies to protect vulnerable and exploited workers by operating an effective licensing regime and by targeting, dismantling and disrupting serious and organised crime. In doing so, it contributes to the government’s work to tackle modern slavery, organised crime and illegal working. Since beginning operations in 2006, it has issued more than 2,500 licences, and there are currently just under 1,000 licence holders. In that time, the authority has brought 69 successful prosecutions - 44 for unlicensed gangmasters, 24 for using an unlicensed gangmaster, and one for obstructing an investigation. The GLA has also revoked licences in 204 cases, where the holder has breached licensing standards on pay, safety and other matters. Moving the GLA to the Home Office will strengthen the GLA ’s operational links to the wider law enforcement family: the NCA , the regional crime hubs, local police forces and immigration enforcement teams. A specific single point of contact in the NCA intelligence hub and in Immigration Enforcement Intelligence will be provided and GLA investigators will also have access to College of Policing accredited training developed for Immigration Enforcement investigators."

/government/news/environment-agency-board-visits-lincolnshire,"The Environment Agency’s Board has visited Lincolnshire to see the work taking place to reduce flood risk in the county.  Environment Agency Board visits Lincolnshire  Environment Agency Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Chairman Lord Chris Smith was joined by Environment Agency board members and executive directors during the visit which included a visit to the Lincolnshire coast and to the towns of Horncastle and Boston and other communities. During the winter storms, 116,000 properties in Lincolnshire were protected by Environment Agency flood defences and across the country 1.4 million properties were protected. East coast tidal surge Lord Smith said: The East Coast experienced a tidal surge on the 5 December which was bigger than the one in 1953 which caused such widespread destruction. Our coastal defences have been much improved since 1953 and stood up to the test. Unfortunately 583 homes and businesses flooded in Boston and more than 160 properties flooded along the South Humber bank. However, it is clear the investment in sea defences over many years was the main reason more significant flooding was avoided. Lincolnshire’s coastal flood plain extends 9km inland and we have invested over £300 million over the last 40 years to reduce the risk to communities and businesses.” Swift repairs In addition to seeing first-hand the swift repairs to flood defences which have been carried out in Boston since December, board members also heard about planned works to reduce flood risk to Lincolnshire communities. This included the proposed Boston Barrier scheme which is currently expected to be completed in 2019 at a cost of just over £90 million. Once built, the barrier will provide added flood protection to the town and will also control water levels in the Haven to make navigation on Boston’s waterways easier. In Horncastle, they heard from representatives of Horncastle Town Council about how a scheme to reduce flood risk in the town is progressing. The Horncastle scheme, which includes proposals for a flood storage reservoir upstream of the town and property-level flood protection, is being progressed by the Environment Agency in partnership with Lincolnshire County Council, East Lindsey District Council, Horncastle Town Council and internal drainage boards. Construction of the reservoir is expected to start in 2015. The Board members also had the opportunity to discuss the challenges of reducing flood risk to the 30,000 properties, 19,000 static caravans and 35,000 hectares of land on Lincolnshire’s low-lying coastal flood plain as they travelled along the coast to Ingoldmells. The tour was followed by a meeting with representatives of the Environment Agency’s partner organisations. Read more about the Government’s reponse to flooding."

/government/news/work-to-improve-littlehamptons-tidal-defences-is-progressing-well,"The phase to construct a 450 metre long tidal river wall along the East Bank of the River Arun is now due to be completed in May.  Work to improve Littlehampton’s tidal defences is progressing well  Environment Agency Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs This flood alleviation scheme is part of an adaptive tidal food risk management approach to predicted sea level rise. When the whole scheme is completed it will protect over 2,000 residential properties and businesses. The multi-million pound scheme, created in partnership with Arun District Council, Littlehampton Harbour Board and West Sussex County Council, will also vastly improve the walkway along the riverside, creating an attractive pedestrian route between the town and the beach. Work to the flood wall will be complemented by design work which will raise the promenade, enhancing the views across the river. These enhancements, together with works to realign the flood embankments north of the A259 road bridge, are scheduled to be completed this autumn as work will continue throughout the summer. David Robinson, Environment Agency Flood and Coastal Risk Operations Manager, said: I am very pleased that work on this major project to protect thousands of Littlehampton residents from tidal flooding is moving forward quickly, particularly after such challenging weather conditions over the winter. Following the wettest winter on record it was very frustrating for the whole project team that adverse weather conditions unavoidably led to slower progress on the project than expected. These extreme weather events reinforce the critical importance of protecting the people of Littlehampton from flooding. I want to thank residents and businesses for their understanding and ongoing support whilst construction continues to provide Littlehampton with a world-class flood defence scheme and a wonderful new public space for all to enjoy. Throughout the duration of this ambitious project we have worked with businesses to help them remain trading as normal in the Pier Road and Arun Parade areas, despite necessary traffic closures and our construction activities. Free parking for the customers of Pier Road shops, restaurants and Harbour Park has been made available by Arun District Council in the West Green Car Park for the duration of the flood defence works. Councillor Paul Dendle, Arun District Council’s Cabinet Member for Environmental Services said “I look forward to the successful completion of this important scheme and to the benefits that this will bring to Littlehampton, both in terms of flood protection and the exciting enhancements to the street scene.” A public visitors’ centre, located on the north-western corner of the Oyster Pond on Arun Parade, is now open from Wednesday to Sunday from 12 noon to 5pm for interested members of the public to visit and find out more about the project. Notice boards have been set up on site for businesses and visitors to the area to find out more about the scheme and to be kept informed of its progress."
/government/news/dangerous-dogs-owners-face-tougher-sentences-for-attacks,"Changes to the Dangerous Dogs Act come in to force today  Dangerous dogs: owners face tougher sentences for attacks  Ministry of Justice Home Office Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Irresponsible dog owners who allow their dog to attack people or assistance dogs will face tougher prison sentences from today. Changes to the Dangerous Dogs Act will also mean dog owners can now face prosecution if their dog attacks a person in their home or on any private property, except if they attack a trespasser. The maximum sentences for allowing a dog to attack someone have also been substantially increased. The maximum prison sentences in England and Wales are now: Up to 14 years, from two years, for a fatal dog attack. Up to five years, from two years, for injury. Up to three years if an assistance dog is attacked. Animal Welfare Minister Lord de Mauley said: Dog attacks can have horrific consequences for victims and families and it is only right those responsible should face tough punishments. Irresponsible dog owners will not only face longer prison sentences, but will also be liable for prosecution regardless of where an attack takes place, even in their own home. This will give protection to those who provide vital services in the community – postal workers, nurses, utility workers - as well as people visiting family and friends. For the first time, the Dangerous Dogs Act also includes a specific offence to protect assistance dogs from attacks. Guide Dogs Chief Executive Richard Leaman said: An attack on a guide dog can be devastating. It can rob someone with sight loss of their independence and freedom, leaving them virtually housebound. We’re delighted that irresponsible owners can now be given tougher sentences if their dog attacks an assistance dog. With an average of 10 guide dogs being attacked every month, we’re looking to the police to fully use their new powers to protect vulnerable people from these sometimes life-changing attacks.” The changes will also see new preventative powers for the police and local authorities so they can act early to stop dog attacks before they occur. These measures include steps the dog owner can take to address their own or their dog’s behaviour, for example: Attending dog training classes. Repairing fencing to their property to prevent the dog escaping. Requiring their dog to be muzzled in public. Crime Prevention Minister Norman Baker said: The coalition government is already making real progress in defending the public from out of control dogs and their irresponsible owners. Today’s measures will protect individuals and also assistance dogs, which bring security, confidence and independence to their handlers. Later this year, new measures under the ASB, Crime and Policing Act will enable frontline professionals to crack down on anti-social dog owners who allow their animals to foul public places, menace members of the public and cause distress in the community.” Further measures to help tackle irresponsible dog ownership will come in to force in April 2016 when microchipping will be a legal requirement for all dogs in England, and from March 2015 in Wales.

/government/speeches/the-united-kingdoms-national-strategy-for-maritime-security,"Maritime security is vital and the new UK national strategy will make us more robust and more resilient. The United Kingdom's national strategy for maritime security  Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure National Crime Agency Border Force Maritime and Coastguard Agency Marine Management Organisation Ministry of Defence Closed organisation: Department of Energy & Climate Change Department for Transport Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs I’m delighted to be here to mark the launch of the UK national strategy for maritime security . There can be few places more appropriate to discuss the importance of maritime security to the life of the nation than the UK Chamber of Shipping . As shipping minister I regularly visit the UK’s indispensable maritime infrastructure. And I recently visited Dover to set out a plan for the future of the port . It is one of our largest ports, an essential link with continental Europe and a vital artery of the nation’s economy and it is therefore vital that we have a thriving port and thriving town. So I was delighted that we have reached an agreement that will allow this to happen. But one other thing struck me when I was in the town. On the seafront is an extremely impressive Merchant Navy memorial . The statue depicts a merchant seaman keeping watch on the waves. It stands as a reminder to the immense contribution made by the men and women of the Merchant Navy to the war effort. Winston Churchill remarked that: But for the Merchant Navy who brought us the food and munitions of war, Britain would have been in a perilous state. And we’re here today (13 May 2014) because the security and safety of our sea lanes and those that use them remain essential. Because as island nation without secure shipping, we would not have sufficient food on our tables, goods in our shops, material for our factories, nor the energy needed to keep the lights on. So we simply cannot underestimate the importance of the sea to the British way of life. But that very importance of maritime to Britain brings commensurate challenges. While the need to maintain security is permanent the nature of the threats we face wax and wane over time. The strategy we are launching today identifies our current priorities including: the risk of terrorist strikes against cargo or passenger ships attacks on UK maritime infrastructure, from ports to offshore assets, including cyber-attack transportation by sea of threats into the UK - including weapons of mass destruction, drugs and guns people smuggling and human trafficking and the risk that disruption to vital maritime trade routes impacts on our ability to transport the people, food and goods that we need. But we should remember that the UK starts from a position of strength. When it comes to maritime security we are standing on the shoulders of giants.We have a long and proud maritime history and we have significant resources available including first class police, military and diplomatic capabilities. But just as the nature of the challenges we face change our greatest strength comes from knowing when we can become even better at protecting our national interests. That is why the UK now has, for the first time, a national maritime security strategy to bring all of our good work together. The strategy sets out the objectives we wish to achieve, and how we intend to improve our efforts in the future. Finally it outlines the governance structure which will allow us to deliver effective and efficient maritime security. First, we are improving our knowledge of the threats we face now and in the future. We will review the maritime risk assessment biennially to ensure it remains focussed on the threats of greatest concern to UK maritime interests. This will help us identify future resource competition including in the marine transportation and off-shore energy sectors. This will be particularly important as the potential for international tension in the northern sea route increases in significance. Second, we are improving partnership working between departments and agencies. The strategy highlights the excellent work of Border Force and others in helping to combat illegal activity in UK waters. Our Royal Navy Offshore Patrol vessels and Border Force fast patrol ships carry out reconnaissance, deterrence and interdiction at sea. The National Crime Agency ( NCA ) will lead the whole of law enforcements fight against serious and organised crime affecting the UK. In 2010, as part of the Strategic defence and security review , we established the National Maritime Information Centre ( NMIC ) in a temporary location to the West of London. The NMIC brings together maritime information and intelligence from across government departments and agencies and acts as a national focal point for international partners. It provides real time information on maritime activity around the UK and areas of national interest. It supports government and industry decision-making in times of need. We are already benefitting from this approach. We are able to globally source information that previously would have remained obscured. The NMIC will move to a permanent and bespoke location at the end of the summer to further capitalise on this collaborative approach. And I’m pleased to say that Border Force have accepted the important role of lead executive agency for the NMIC from this April. Let me give just one example of the benefits we are seeing. In august last year the agency supplied intelligence to the NMIC on a potential drug shipment to the UK. The NMIC used its ship tracking expertise and contacts across government to co-ordinate our efforts. This led to the seizure of a ship containing a major shipment of Class A drugs bound for the UK’s streets. I want to see more of this happening. So we will develop the mechanisms for joint working to become even more productive. Third, we will protect Britain’s essential maritime assets. The Marine Management Organisation and the devolved administrations, working with others, will secure UK fish stocks. The Department for Energy and Climate Change , supported by the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure , will safeguard UK energy supplies. This includes approximately 300 gas and oil rigs and a rapidly increasing number of off-shore wind farms. And the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has commissioned work to improve the security of the 40% of our food that arrives by sea. My own department is responsible for the safeguarding of UK ports and REG flagged shipping from acts of terrorism. And in another example of joint working industry colleagues are responsible for having in place security measures on the ground to protect UK ports and shipping. Departmental and Maritime and Coastguard Agency inspectors work closely with them providing expert advice and guidance. And there is cross-government collaboration to fund trials of new screening and detection technology to detect the threat items of the future and we have put in place a policy for allowing the use of armed guards on ships to protect them from acts of piracy. Underpinning this is the recognition that we need to manage what we do more effectively. That is why the strategy confirms the new maritime security governance structure now in place in the UK. Top level direction is provided by the ministerial working group on maritime security. And a new body of senior officials from across all departments and agencies will co-ordinate the security work-streams. But meeting maritime threats effectively would not be possible without the close support and involvement of UK industry. So that is why we have, for the first time, created a national level maritime security committee to be chaired by industry. It will sit alongside the officials’ body and provide it with industry expertise to assist its efforts. I am delighted to say, given this venue, that the UK Chamber of Shipping have accepted the role of chair of the committee. That will ensure the partnership between government and industry on maritime security will be even stronger. I am confident this new governance structure will ensure protecting maritime remains a priority for government. Our efforts will be even better co-ordinated and our resources exploited to the maximum. So to sum up, we face new and evolving threats to the UK’s essential maritime interests. We are gearing up to meet these. We start from a position of strength. This strategy will make us more robust and more resilient. It includes an exciting new partnership with industry, led by the UK Chamber of Shipping and I’d like to take this opportunity to thank you for your contribution to the UK’s safety and security. I’ll now hand you over to Mark Francois who will speak to you about the equally important international dimension of the strategy."

/government/news/uk-government-secures-eu-support-for-fisheries-affected-by-russian-ban,"EU deal struck to help Scottish fishermen combat Russian trade embargo UK Government secures EU support for fisheries affected by Russian ban  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Fishermen affected by the Russian food export ban will benefit from EU wide support thanks to lobbying by the UK government, Fisheries Minister George Eustice announced last night. The UK has led on securing a change to EU law so mackerel and herring fishermen can ‘bank’ a higher proportion of their quota this year and use it next year instead. This will provide more time for industry to make trade deals with new international markets, making up for the loss of Russian trade. The EU Fisheries Council has now agreed to ‘bank’ 25% of 2014 quota, up from the standard 10 per cent, and roll it over for use in 2015. The Russian ban has had the biggest effect in Scotland where fishermen hold 70% of the UK mackerel quota. Fisheries Minister George Eustice said: “We pledged support for our world class mackerel industry following this unjustified ban and have been campaigning hard in Europe ever since. “This success is a great example of industry and Government working together to deliver swift, practical help and shows the UK’s leadership in Europe. “This will provide time to negotiate more trade deals for mackerel so our fishermen can take their catch to what we hope will be a bigger, more valuable market.” The decision follows Secretary of State Elizabeth Truss’ visit to Peterhead in August where she heard first-hand about the effects of the Russian ban on Scottish fishing businesses and the need for quota flexibility. The agreement will support the Government’s wider efforts to help the industry develop new markets for British mackerel. There have been recent Government led trade visits to Vietnam, Japan and Hong Kong where mackerel was promoted to buyers from Asia. British mackerel will also be promoted at China Fisheries in Qingdao next month. The UK government has also been working with the EU reopen the Nigerian market, which is an important alternative for the industry – some companies are now successfully exporting following import restrictions imposed by the Nigerian Government earlier this year. Welcoming the news that fishermen affected by the Russian food export ban will benefit from EU support thanks to lobbying by the UK Government the Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael said: “I warmly welcome today’s announcement. This underlines the UK Government’s commitment to use our influence in the corridors of power in Brussels to secure legal changes that will benefit both mackerel fishermen and processors in Scotland. “This is a great example of the UK Government working together with industry and major Scottish fishing communities such as those in the North East to help ensure fishing will be as much a part of Scotland’s future as it has been of our past.” Notes to Editors: EU rules limit banking of quota into the following fishing year to 10%. This year the UK government secured 290,000 tonnes of mackerel quota for UK fishermen. This was an increase of 85% on 2013. Last night decision will mean fishermen could potentially reserve 72,500 tonnes for activities next year when new and alternative markets are expected to have been identified. Russia’s market for our fisheries account for 18% of our mackerel exports and generated £16m last year.

/government/news/dangerous-dogs-tough-new-law-to-help-prevent-attacks,"Police and local authorities to be given new legal powers to tackle irresponsible dog ownership Dangerous dogs: tough new law to help prevent attacks  Home Office Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Tough new legal powers to help prevent thousands of dog attacks every year will be given to police forces and local authorities from Monday 20 October. For the first time, police and local authorities will be able to demand that owners take action to prevent a dog attack or risk fine of up to £20,000. If a complaint has been made about a dog to the council or police, its owners could be ordered to do any or all of the following: Attend dog training classes Muzzle the dog or require it to be on a lead in public Require the dog to be microchipped and/or neutered Repair fencing to prevent the dog leaving the property Launched today, the Dealing with irresponsible dog ownership: practitioner’s manual will guide police forces and local authorities in the use of their new legal powers to prevent dog attacks. Animal Welfare Minister Lord de Mauley said: “Dog attacks are devastating for victims and their families which is why we are taking tough action against those who allow them to happen. Police and local authorities will now have more powers to demand that irresponsible dog owners take steps to prevent attacks before they occur. This is on top of the tougher prison sentences we introduced earlier this year for owners who allow their dogs to attack people and assistance dogs.” The National Policing Lead for Dangerous Dogs, DCC Gareth Pritchard said: “The Practitioners Manual gives police officers and other practitioners clear guidance on how to best implement the legislative changes, especially the early preventative measures such as Community Protection Notices, to help prevent more serious events occurring in the future. It also provides a platform to share good practice between police forces and partner agencies and it will form part of the ongoing training of Dog Legislation Officers across England and Wales.” Earlier this year, legal changes were made to enable prosecution for a dog attack on private property and maximum prison sentences were extended to: 14 years, from two years, for a fatal dog attack. Five years, from two years, for injury. Three years for an attack on an assistance dog. The new powers for authorities has also received the support of the Royal Mail Director of Safety, Health, Wellbeing & Sustainability, Shaun Davis: “Royal Mail campaigned for changes to the Dangerous Dog Act to ensure our postmen and women are protected when they enter private property including a customer’s garden. We are pleased that these further changes will help police forces and local authorities use their new legal powers to prevent dog attacks.” Photo credit: iStockphoto/Thinkstock."

Western Waters crab effort management notification  Marine Management Organisation Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs The Marine Management Organisation ( MMO ) is providing early notification to the fishing industry that fishing patterns for Western Waters (ICES Area VII) edible and spider crab are ahead of forecasts. This makes an end of year closure more likely in order to ensure that the UK stays within the EC-set effort limits under the Western Waters Regime. Any potential closure of the area VII crab fishery would affect over 15 metre vessels only. In July of this year, with agreement with industry representatives, a days at sea limit was adopted for this fishery for the remainder of 2014. However, data shows that on Thursday 30 October 2014 effort uptake in this fishery was at 85 percent, which is ahead of our end of year forecasts. The MMO has notified the fishing industry to enable them to work together on how best to use the remaining effort for this year. The MMO will continue to monitor effort uptake on a weekly basis and will review the position if: Industry-representatives successfully negotiate an effort swap with another Member State Bad weather restricts the current rate of effort uptake in the fishery The MMO receives fishing activity plans from vessels that indicate some vessels may deviate from current fishing activity patterns The MMO is working with both the fishing industry and Defra to meet commitments under the Western Waters Regime and avoid incurring penalties from the European Commission."

F gas in refrigeration, air conditioning and fire protection systems  Environment Agency Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Many refrigeration, fire protection and air conditioning and heat pump systems contain hydrofluorocarbons ( HFCs ).  HFCs  are a type of fluorinated greenhouse gas ( F gas ). Companies that operate or service and maintain equipment containing F gas must meet these requirements. Check if your system contains F gas Look at the list of F gases regulated by the EU . To find out if your equipment contains one of these F gases you can: check your manual or the labels on your equipment speak to the company that installed your equipment HFC 404A and HFC 134a are common in refrigeration systems. HFC 23 and HFC 227ea are common in fire protection systems. HFC 404A and HFC 410A are common in air conditioning and heat pump systems. Use trained technicians Only trained technicians can carry out work on equipment containing F gases , including: installation testing for leaks general maintenance disposal or decommissioning when you no longer need the product For refrigeration systems in vehicles, (eg cars, trains and ships) this only applies to: refrigerated trucks that weigh more than 3.5 tonnes refrigerated trailers that are designed to be towed by a truck or tractor Check that anyone working on your equipment is qualified. Read more about the specific qualifications needed to work on equipment containing F gases . Label equipment You must add a label if you add F gas to refrigeration, fire protection or air conditioning equipment when you’re installing it. The label must state: that the equipment contains an F gas the industry name for the F gas , or the chemical name if there isn’t an accepted industry name From 2017 the label must also state the: mass of F gas in the equipment (in kg) carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) equivalent mass of F gas in the equipment (in tonnes) the global warming potential of the F gas Find the global warming potential of each F gas on the list of F gases regulated by the EU . Find out how to use an F gas ’ global warming potential to calculate the weight of the F gas in CO 2 equivalent . ‘Hermetically sealed’ equipment If F gas is ‘hermetically sealed’ within a product, the label must also state that’s the case. F gas is hermetically sealed if both of the following apply: any part of the product that contains F gas is welded or brazed shut, or permanently sealed in another way the product has a tested leakage rate of less than 3 grams per year A system that meets these 2 conditions is considered hermetically sealed, even if it has capped valves or capped service ports to allow access for repairs and maintenance. Check for leaks You’re responsible for stopping leaks from your equipment. Contractors that install, maintain or dispose of equipment share responsibility for trying to stop leaks with the operators of equipment. You must check all equipment for leaks. For equipment that contains F gas above certain thresholds, you must check for leaks at specific intervals. Thresholds at which leaks check intervals are specified The thresholds at which leak check intervals are specified are expressed in terms of CO 2 equivalent. They take into account both the quantity of F gas in the equipment and the ‘global warming potential’ of the F gas (how much the F gas contributes to global warming). This table sets out the: F gas thresholds, in tonnes CO 2 equivalent, at which leak leak check intervals are specified maximum allowed interval between leaks checks for equipment that meets each threshold quantities of commonly used HFCs equal to each threshold Maximum interval between leak checks CO 2 (tonnes) HFC 23 (kg) HFC 227ea (kg) HFC 404A (kg) HFC 410a (kg) HFC 134a (kg) 1 year 5 0.3 1.6 1.3 2.4 3.5 6 months 50 3.4 15.5 13 24 35 3 months 500 34 155 127 240 350 You can find out global warming potentials of other F gases in the list of F gases regulated by the EU , and use global warming potentials to calculate the CO 2 equivalent of an F gas . Equipment that didn’t require leak checks under the 2006 regulation may do so now, if it contains an F gas with a high global warming potential, like HFC 404A. Special cases and exemptions If you install a system to automatically detect leaks, the maximum interval between leak checks is doubled. For example you only need to leak check a product that contains F gas equivalent to 5 tonnes CO 2 once every 2 years, if you fit a leak detection system. There’s no maximum interval for leak checks on hermetically sealed refrigeration and air conditioning systems unless they contain F gas equivalent to 10 tonnes CO 2 . That’s equal to 2.6 kg of HFC404A or 7 kg of HFC 134a. There’s no maximum interval for leak checks on refrigeration systems in vehicles, unless the vehicle is a refrigerated truck or trailer. The maximum intervals don’t apply until 2017 for equipment that contains less than 3 kg of F gas . If you find a leak If a leak is found during a check, you must repair it and repeat the test within a month to check the repair worked. Install leak detection equipment You must fit a leak detection system if your equipment contains F gas equivalent to more than 500 tonnes of CO 2 . This doesn’t apply to transport refrigeration systems, eg refrigeration systems in trucks, trailers, trains or ships. For gases commonly used in refrigeration, air conditioning or fire protection, this table sets out the mass of gas equivalent to 500 tonnes of CO 2 . F gas Mass of gas equal to 500 tonnes of CO 2 HFC 23 34 HFC 508 38 HFC 507 125 HFC 404A 127 HFC 434A 154 HFC 227ea 155 HFC 422D 183 HFC 438A 221 HFC 410A 239 HFC 407C 282 HFC 134a 350 The leak detection system must alert you, or a service company responsible for your equipment, if a leak is detected. You must have your leak detection system checked once a year to make sure it’s working properly. A system that didn’t need leak detection equipment under the 2006 regulation may do so now, if it contains an F gas with a high global warming potential, like HFC 404A F gases that can’t be used to refill equipment from 2020 From 2020 you won’t be able to use some ‘virgin’ (unused) F gases to refill existing refrigeration systems. The ‘service ban’ will apply when both these conditions are met: the refrigeration system contains F gas equivalent to 40 tonnes of CO 2 or more the virgin F gas has a global warming potential of more than 2,500 The service ban won’t apply to fire protection systems or air conditioning and heat pump systems. Refrigeration systems affected This will mainly affect the use of HFC 404A in: industrial refrigeration systems large commercial refrigeration systems, eg ‘central pack’ systems used in supermarkets large transport refrigeration systems, eg in trains or ships Most refrigeration systems in trucks and trailers don’t use enough F gas to be covered by the ban, but the largest could be affected. For gases that are commonly used in refrigeration and have global warming potentials above 2,500, this table sets out the mass needed to trigger the service ban. F gas Mass of F gas needed to trigger service ban HFC 508 3 HFC 507 10 HFC 404A 10.2 HFC 434A 12.3 HFC 422D 14.7 Options when the ban applies If you need to add refrigerant to systems affected by the ban after 2020 you’ll need to do one of the following: use an F gas with a global warming potential of more than 2,500 that has been reclaimed (up to 2030 only) use an F gas with a global warming potential of more than 2,500 that has been recycled either from your own equipment, or by the company servicing your equipment remove all of the F gas from the system and replace it with an F gas that has a global warming potential lower than 2,500, eg HFC 407A of HFC 407F (this is known as ‘retrofilling’) replace the refrigeration system with new equipment that uses a refrigerant with a lower global warming potential Less of your equipment will be affected by the ban if you buy equipment that uses refrigerants with low global warming potentials. Keep records The operator of equipment, and the company that services it, must keep the following records about any equipment that has to be checked for leaks (ie any equipment that contains F gas equivalent to more than 5 tonnes of CO 2 ): quantity and type of gas in the equipment when it’s installed quantity and type of gas added during any maintenance (eg leak repairs) details (name, address and certificate number if relevant) of any companies that install, service or decommission the equipment dates and results of all mandatory leak checks measures taken to recover and dispose of gases when you dispose of the equipment (eg disposing of it through a registered waste carrier ) You must also record if the gas used in the equipment has been recycled or reclaimed and if so the: details of the recycling or reclamation facility (name, address and certificate number if it has one) quantity of any gases recovered You must keep records for 5 years and make them available to government officials if they ask for them. The following requirements weren’t in the previous regulation: recording measures taken to recover and dispose of gases recording if the gas is recycled or reclaimed and the facility that recycled or reclaimed it Recover F gases when disposing of equipment You must use a qualified technician to recover F gas when disposing of equipment.

Recover F gas when disposing of equipment and insulating foam  Environment Agency Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs If you own or operate equipment that contains fluorinated greenhouse gas ( F gas ), you must hire a qualified technician to recover the F gas when the equipment reaches the end of its life. See a list of F gases regulated by the EU that you must recover from equipment. Equipment is at the end of its life when you dispose of it or permanently stop using it. Find out the qualifications required to recover F gas . Different types of equipment like refrigeration systems, solvents and high voltage switchgear, require different qualifications. Equipment F gas must be recovered from in all cases F gas must be recovered from the following equipment before you dispose of it: commercial or industrial refrigeration systems and refrigeration systems used in trucks, trailers, ships and other vehicles stationary air conditioning and heat pump systems (eg air conditioners that are fitted to buildings and can’t be moved) portable or mobile air conditioning systems stationary fire protection systems (eg automatic fire response systems in large buildings) high voltage switchgear F gas must also be recovered from solvents, eg fluorinated solvents used in industrial cleaning processes. Equipment F gas must be recovered from when possible F gas must be recovered from other equipment, like foam insulation or aerosols, if both of the following apply: it’s technically feasible it doesn’t involve disproportionate cost. Your technician will advise you about the technical feasibility and expense. You can also contact the Environment Agency if you want to check whether it’s cost effective and feasible to recover an F gas . There are also guidelines about when it’s feasible and proportionate to recover F gas from foam insulation and aerosols. Foam insulation It’s considered feasible and proportionate to recover F gas from foam insulation if the foam can be separated from other materials. That’s the case with: block foam used to insulate pipes or vessels steel faced insulation panels, once they’re cut up It’s not considered feasible and proportionate to recover F gas if the insulation can’t be easily separated from other material, eg if it’s part of a laminated panel. But you must treat the combined material as hazardous waste if it contains any of the following: HFCs hydrochlorofluorocarbons ( HCFCs ) chlorofluorocarbon (CFCs). Aerosols It’s not considered cost effective to recover gas from individual aerosols (eg spray paints or deodrants). But if you collect large quantities of aerosols together, you should send them to a licensed waste facility so the F gas can be recovered. Contact your local authority to find out about your nearest licensed waste facility. Options for recovering F gas from different equipment types Your technician will need to recover F gas from the following types of equipment before the equipment is dismantled: stationary air conditioning and heat pump systems stationary fire protection systems, eg an automatic system installed in a large building any refrigeration system where the refrigerant isn’t hermetically sealed within the equipment F gas is hermetically sealed in equipment if both of the following apply: any part of the product that contains F gas is welded or brazed shut, or permanently sealed in another way the product has a tested leakage rate of less than 3 grams per year A system that meets these 2 conditions is considered hermetically sealed even if it has capped valves or capped service ports to allow access for repairs and maintenance. Hermetically sealed systems For hermetically sealed refrigeration systems, and hermetically sealed portable air conditioners, you can do either of the following: get your technician to recover the gas before the unit is dismantled send the whole unit to a licensed waste facility Contact your local authority to find out about your nearest licensed waste facility. Foam insulation You must make sure foam insulation is separated from other material and sent to a licensed waste facility. Contact your local authority to find out about your nearest licensed waste facility. You don’t have to do this if you’re sending the entire piece of equipment to a licensed waste facility, eg if you’re sending a refrigeration system that contains foam insulation to a licensed waste facility. Reclaim recovered F gas You can send the following types of F gas to specialist reprocessing plants where they can be ‘reclaimed’ and sold: refrigerants hydrofluorocarbons ( HFCs ) used in foam insulation HFCs used in fire protection systems SF 6 from high voltage switchgear propellants from aerosols solvents Speak to the technician that is recovering your F gas about how to send gas for reclamation. Recycle recovered F gas It’s sometimes possible to recycle the following gases at your premises when you’re decommissioning your system: refrigerants used in eg refrigeration or air conditioning systems HFCs used in fire protection systems SF 6 from high voltage switchgear propellants from aerosols solvents Ask the technician recovering the F gas if it’s possible to recycle it. The technician will carry out a basic cleaning process when they recover the gas if it’s possible. The gas can then be re-used. Recycled gas with a global warming potential of more than 2,500 can only be used in equipment owned or operated by either the: company that owned the refrigeration system from which the F gas was recovered organisation that carried out the recovery You can find out the global warming potential of F gases on the table of F gases regulated by the EU . Destroy recovered gas You can send recovered F gas to a licensed waste facility for incineration. Contact your local authority to find out about your nearest licensed waste facility."
/guidance/bans-on-f-gas-in-new-equipment,"Details of bans on the use of fluorinated greenhouse gases (F gases) in new equipment like refrigeration systems. Bans on F gas in new equipment  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs The EU has introduced the following bans on the sale of equipment containing fluorinated greenhouse gas ( F gas ). The bans don’t affect the buying and selling of second-hand equipment. Some bans only apply to hydrofluorocarbons ( HFCs ) or perfluorocarbons (PFCs), or gases with specific global warming potentials. All F gases , including HFCs and PFCs, are listed with their global warming potentials in the table of F gases regulated by the EU . Some bans only apply to ‘hermetically sealed’ equipment. That’s equipment where both of the following apply: any part of the product that contains F gas is welded or brazed shut, or permanently sealed in another way the product has a tested leakage rate of less than 3 grams per year A system that meets these 2 conditions is considered hermetically sealed even if it has capped valves or capped service ports to allow access for repairs and maintenance. Refrigerants HFCs and PFCs have been banned in non-confined direct evaporation systems since 2007. A non-confined direct evaporation system is a situation where a refrigerant can escape directly into the atmosphere, eg a bath of liquid nitrogen with no container to prevent evaporation. From 2015 HFCs with global warming potentials above 150 are banned in domestic fridges and freezers. From 2020 HFCs with global warming potentials of more than 2,500 will be banned in all refrigeration systems. This will mainly affect the use of HFC 404A in commercial and industrial refrigeration systems. The only exception will be for use in systems that cool products to below -50 degrees Celsius (°C) From 2022 All F gases with global warming potentials of more than 150 will be banned as the refrigerant or foam blowing agent in any hermetically sealed system. This will mainly affect the use of: HFC 134a as a refrigerant HFCs 245fa and 365mfc as foam blowing agents F gases with global warming potentials of more than 150 will also be banned in central pack systems with a rated cooling capacity of 40 kW or more. Central pack systems involve several refrigerated display cases connected to a central refrigeration system located in a plant room, or outdoors. This ban only applies to refrigeration systems used in commercial settings, like convenience stores and supermarkets. It doesn’t apply to refrigeration systems used in industry, eg in chemical processes. For primary circuits in cascade systems, this ban will only apply to F gases with global warming potentials above 1,500. Insulating foam F gases with global warming potentials above 150 have been banned in one component foam aerosols since 2008. From 2020 and 2023 From 2020 HFCs with global warming potentials of more than 150 will be banned in extruded polystyrene foam ( XPS ). From 2023 HFCs with global warming potentials of more than 150 will be banned in all other foams, including polyurethane. Air conditioning and heat pump systems HFCs with global warming potentials above 150 have been banned in the air conditioning systems of new car ranges since 2013. From 2017 this ban will be extended to the air conditioning systems of all new cars (including new cars from existing ranges). From 2020 From 2020 HFCs with global warming potentials above 150 will be banned in movable air-conditioning equipment. Air conditioning equipment is movable if the end user can move it between rooms. From 2025 From 2025 F gases with a global warming potential above 750 will be banned in ‘single split’ systems that contain less than 3 kg of refrigerant. Single split systems involve one cooling coil connected to a remote condensing unit. There are no bans for larger air-conditioning or heat pump systems, eg chillers or larger split systems. Aerosol F gases HFCs with global warming potentials higher than 150 have been banned in ‘novelty’ aerosols or signal horns since 2009. Novelty aerosols are aerosols sold for entertainment or decorative purposes, for example ‘silly string’. From 2018 From 2018 HFCs with a global warming potential above 150 will be banned in technical aerosols. Technical aerosols are generally used in industrial and manufacturing processes. Household aerosols like deodrants aren’t technical aerosols. The ban won’t apply if: HFCs are required to meet national safety standards the aerosol is used for medical applications F gases in fire protection system PFC have been banned in fire protection systems since 2007. From 2016 HFC 23 will be banned in new fire protection systems. Other applications F gases have been banned in the following items since at least 2008: tyres windows footwear non-refillable containers for bulk product Exemptions Military equipment is exempt from all F gas bans. This only applies to military hardware like tanks and aircraft. It doesn’t apply to non-military equipment used by the military. For example refrigeration systems used in army catering facilities would not be exempt from F gas bans. The European Commission may also grant: a 4 year exemption to ban if you can show that the ban creates technical or safety issues an exemption allowing you to use a banned gas in a specific piece of equipment, if you can show that total greenhouse gas emissions over the life cycle of the equipment, including energy consumption, will be lower as a result Contact the F gas team at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if you’d like to seek an exemption from the EU: fgas@defra.gsi.gov.uk"

HFC phase down in the EU: how it works and exemptions  Environment Agency Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs The EU is cutting the availability of hydrofluorocarbons ( HFCs ) by 79% between 2015 and 2030. Only companies with EU quotas will be able to supply HFCs to the EU market. Find out how to apply for an EU quota to import or produce HFCs and when you can apply for quotas. HFCs , particularly those with high global warming potentials, are likely to become more expensive. The HFCs that are being phased down are listed with their global warming potentials in section 1 of the list of F gases regulated by the EU . Size of the market From 2009 to 2012 HFC sales in the EU averaged 183 million tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) equivalent a year. That’s the baseline for the phase down. The CO 2 equivalent measure takes into account how much each HFC contributes to global warming. Gases that contribute the most will be most affected by the phase down. Find out how to calculate the CO 2 equivalent of different gases . This table shows what percentage of the HFC baseline will be available to the EU market every year until 2030.

HFCs that are bought or sold by third parties count towards the supplier’s quota, even if they end up being used for an exempted activity. HFCs imported to the EU for destruction, or exported from the EU in bulk, are also exempt from the phase down. HFC Registry An EU HFC registry has been set up to monitor the phase down. You must register with the registry if you’re: a producer or importer with a quota to supply HFCs to the EU market an organisation that has received a transfer of all or part of a quota an organisation receiving HFCs that are exempt from the phase down importing equipment from outside the EU that contains HFCs that haven’t been part of the EU market before The deadline for registration was 1 July 2014. Register now in the F gas portal on the European Commission website if you haven’t already. You’ll need to register for a European Commission account to access the F gas portal if you don’t already have an account.

HFC producers and importers: get and transfer EU quotas  Environment Agency Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs The EU is cutting the availability of hydrofluorocarbons ( HFCs ) by 79% between 2015 and 2030. You can see a list of the HFCs that are part of the phase down in section 1 of the table of the fluorinated greenhouse gases (F gases) regulated by the EU . From 2015 you’ll need a quota if you: produce HFCs in the EU import F gas equivalent to 100 tonnes of carbon dioxide or more in a year The 100 tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent threshold is very low. It’s equal to approximately 25 kg of HFC 404A. Find out how to calculate the carbon dioxide equivalent weight of other F gases . Get a quota to produce or import HFCs Quotas for 2015 have already been assigned, but you’ll be able to apply for a 2016 quota in spring 2015. You can only apply for a quota if your company either: is established in the EU has mandated an ‘only representative’ within the EU to comply with quota regulations Companies that produced or imported HFCs between 2009 and 2012, and reported the amount they produced and imported, must apply for quotas as ‘incumbents’. Companies that didn’t produce or import HFCs between 2009 and 2012, or didn’t report the amount they produced or imported, must apply as ‘new entrants’. Every 3 years the EU may reclassify new entrants as incumbents. Join the HFC Registry Producers and importers that hold an HFC quota must join the EU HFC Registry. You must do this regardless of whether you’re an incumbent, a new entrant, or an organisation that has been transferred a quota. The HFC Registry is part of the F gas portal on the European Commission website. You’ll need to register for a European Commission account before accessing the F gas portal, if you don’t have one already. Transfer all or part of your quota Incumbent quota holders can transfer all or part of their quota to another organisation through the HFC registry. The organisation receiving the quota would then be able to produce or import HFCs themselves. The organisation must either: be established in the EU have mandated an ‘only representative’ within the EU to comply with quota regulations New entrant quota holders can’t transfer their quotas. Authorise an importer to use your quota Manufacturers of equipment like refrigeration and air conditioning systems often add HFCs to products as they’re assembling them. This is known as ‘pre-charging’. From 2017 manufacturers must use HFCs from EU quotas in any equipment that’s sold in the EU. You can authorise a non-EU manufacturer to use part of your quota to pre-charge equipment they’re going to import into the EU. New entrant quota holders You must physically send HFCs from your quota to the non-EU manufacturer. Incumbent quota holders You can also physically send HFCs to the non-EU manufacturer. Alternatively you can hold back an agreed amount of HFCs from the market. In this case you must write to the non-EU manufacturer to confirm you won’t make the agreed quantity of HFCs from your quota available to the EU market. The non-EU manufacturer can then buy that quantity of HFCs outside the quota system and use it to in equipment they’re going to sell into the EU.

Calculate the carbon dioxide equivalent quantity of an F gas  Environment Agency Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Some EU requirements for fluorinated greenhouse gases (F gases) have size thresholds. The size thresholds are expressed in terms of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) equivalent. That takes into account how much a gas contributes to global warming, relative to carbon dioxide. Calculate the carbon dioxide equivalent of a quantity of F gas You calculate the carbon dioxide equivalent of a quantity of F gas by multiplying the mass of the gas (in tonnes), by the gas’ global warming potential (GWP). You’ll usually find the mass of an F gas expressed in kilograms (kg) on product labels etc. To convert the mass to tonnes, divide by 1,000. Global warming potentials for F gases are listed in the table of F gases regulated by the EU . You can also find global warming potentials for the gases which have record keeping requirements under the EU regulation . Example calculation The amount in tonnes of CO 2 equivalent is the mass (in tonnes) of F gas multiplied by the GWP of that F gas. For example the global warming potential of HFC 404A is 3,922. Therefore the tonnes CO 2 equivalent of 10kg of HFC 404a is calculated as follows: Mass (in tonnes) of F gas multiplied by GWP of F gas = (10/1,000) * 3,922 = 39.2 tonnes CO 2 equivalent Table of CO2 equivalent thresholds for common F gases For some common F gases, this table lists: global warming potentials the quantities that are equivalent to CO 2 size thresholds used in the EU regulation F gas global warming potential mass, in kg, equal to 5 tonnes CO 2 mass, in kg, equal to 40 tonnes CO 2 mass, in kg, equal to 50 tonnes CO 2 mass, in kg, equal to 500 tonnes CO 2 SF6 22,800 0.2 1.8 2.2 22 HFC 23 14,800 0.3 2.7 3.4 34 HFC 508B 13,396 0.4 3.0 3.7 37 HFC 143a 4,470 1.1 8.9 11.2 112 HFC 507A 3,985 1.3 10.0 12.5 125 HFC 404A 3,922 1.3 10.2 12.7 127 HFC 428A 3,607 1.4 11.1 13.8 139 HFC 125 3,500 1.4 11.4 14.3 143 HFC 434A 3,245 1.5 12.3 15.4 154 HFC 227ea 3,220 1.6 12.4 15.5 155 HFC 422A 3,143 1.6 12.7 15.9 159 HFC 422D 2,729 1.8 14.7 18.3 183 HFC 417A 2,346 2.1 17.1 21.3 213 HFC 423A 2,280 2.2 17.5 21.9 219 HFC 438A 2,264 2.2 17.7 22.1 221 HFC 427A 2,138 2.3 18.7 23.4 234 HFC 407A 2,107 2.4 19.0 23.7 237 HFC 410A 2,088 2.4 19.2 23.9 239 HFC 442A 1,888 2.6 21.2 26.5 265 HFC 407F 1,825 2.7 21.9 27.4 274 HFC 437A 1,805 2.8 22.2 27.7 277 HFC 407C 1,774 2.8 22.5 28.2 282 HFC 426A 1,508 3.3 26.5 33.2 332 HFC 134a 1,430 3.5 28.0 35.0 350 HFC 245fa 1,030 4.9 38.8 48.5 485 HFC 365mfc 794 6.3 50.4 63.0 630 HFC 32 675 7.4 74.1 74.1 741 HFC 152a 124 40.3 322.6 403.2 4,032"

/guidance/how-to-operate-or-service-high-voltage-switchgear-containing-sf6,"Requirements for businesses that operate or service high voltage switchgear that contains sulphur hexaflouride (SF6).  How to operate or service high voltage switchgear containing SF6  Environment Agency Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Sulphur hexaflouride (SF 6 ) is used to insulate equipment in the electricity industry like circuit breakers, switches and transformers. You operate switchgear if you’re in charge of the day-to-day running of the equipment. You don’t have to own the equipment to be the operator. You’re a service company if you maintain switchgear, for example if you install equipment or repair leaks. There’s separate guidance for manufacturers on how to label switchgear that contains SF 6 . Types of switchgear SF 6 is used in both: high voltage transmission switchgear medium voltage switchgear High voltage transmission switchgear often contains hundreds of kilograms (kgs) of SF 6 . The gas is contained in segregated metal enclosures, which can be accessed to perform maintenance. Medium voltage switchgear typically contains less than 5kg of SF 6 . The gas is often sealed within the equipment. You don’t have to maintain SF 6 if it’s sealed inside equipment. Use trained technicians You must have an F gas (fluorinated greenhouse gas) handling certificate to carry out any activity on switchgear that involves handling SF 6 . That includes: installation maintenance and repairs recovery of SF 6 ‘decommissioning’ equipment at the end of its working life Find out how to get an F gas handling certificate for work on high voltage switchgear . Service companies are responsible for making sure their staff have proper qualifications. Check for leaks You must check your equipment for leaks if it contains more than 6kg of SF 6 unless either of the following apply: it has a pressure or density monitoring device the manufacturer has tested it to show it has a leakage rate of less than 0.1% per year, and labelled it to confirm this Most medium voltage switchgear contains less than 5kg of SF 6 , so doesn’t require leak checks. Most large high-voltage swithgear equipment is fitted with a pressure or density monitoring device, so doesn’t require leak checks. Operator and service companies share responsibility for stopping SF 6 leaks. This is a requirement from 1 January 2015. You didn’t have to check high voltage switchgear for leaks under the 2006 regulation. How often to check If you do have to check your equipment for leaks, you must do this every: 6 months if it contains between 6 and 22kg of SF 6 3 months if it contains more than 22kg of SF 6 You only have to check for leaks half as often if you install a system that automatically detects them. If you find a leak If a leak is found during a check, you must repair it and repeat the test within a month to check the repair worked. Install leak detection equipment You must fit a leak detection system to any equipment installed after 1 January 2017 that contains more than 22kg of SF 6 . The operator is responsible for making sure the system is fitted. The leak detection system must alert the operator or service company if a leak is detected. You must have your leak detection system checked at least every 6 years to make sure it’s working properly. This is a requirement from 1 January 2015. You didn’t have to install leak detection equipment on high voltage switchgear under the 2006 regulation. Keep records The company operating the switchgear, or the company servicing it, must keep the following records about any equipment that has leak checking requirements: quantity of SF 6 in the equipment when it’s installed quantity of SF 6 added during any maintenance (eg installation or leak repairs) quantity of SF 6 recovered during any maintenance (eg decommissioning at end of life or leak repairs) details (name, address and certificate number if relevant) of any companies that work on the equipment dates and results of all mandatory leak checks measures taken to recover SF 6 , and the quantity recovered, when you decommission the equipment If your technician adds recycled or reclaimed SF 6 to your equipment, you or your contractor must record the following details about the recycling or reclamation facility: name address certificate number You must keep records for 5 years and make them available to inspectors if they ask for them. The following requirements weren’t in the 2006 regulation: recording measures taken to recover and dispose of gases recording if the gas is recycled or reclaimed and the facility that recycled or reclaimed it Recover SF6 You must recover SF 6 when your service high voltage switchgear and before you dispose of high voltage switchgear that you’re decommissioning. You must employ someone with an F gas handling certificate for work on high voltage switchgear to do this.

/government/news/first-norfolk-stretch-of-england-coast-path-opens-today,"Walkers can now enjoy 41 km of coastline between Sea Palling and Weybourne in Norfolk. First Norfolk stretch of England Coast Path opens today  Natural England Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Earlier this year, the Secretary of State for the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, approved this new stretch of England Coast Path . Work to implement the new route, including new signage and gates, has been taking place since then in preparation for today’s announcement. Walkers will be given new rights of access to foreshore, beaches, dunes and cliffs; including areas where everyone can rest, relax and admire the view. Crucially, the path will now be able to ‘roll back’ if land erodes or slips, enabling a replacement route to be put in place quickly if necessary. This solves longstanding difficulties with maintaining a continuous route along the coast. When complete, the England Coast Path will be a well way-marked National Trail around the whole English coast. Work is already underway on more sections around England and proposals are being developed in discussion with local authorities, landowners and businesses. Following recent government funding announcements, the entire path is due to be completed by 2020. Stretches also opened in Cumbria and Durham earlier this year. As well as enabling visitors to enjoy new parts of the coastline, improving access will help to support local economies, by attracting new visitors to the coast and increasing associated spending in seaside businesses such as shops, pubs and hotels. Natural England have worked with Norfolk County Council are holding a launch event in Trimingham today, attended by local MP Norman Lamb who will officially open the new route. Local HM Coastguard teams are taking part in a sponsored walk of the new section, to build their knowledge of the route and raise money for Guide Dogs for the Blind. Natural England’s Chairman, Andrew Sells said: I am delighted that Norfolk’s first stretch of the England Coast Path is now open for residents and visitors to enjoy. We thank everyone who’s worked with us to open up this new route, including Norfolk County Council and HM Coastguard, local landowners, businesses and other interest groups including a range of access and conservation organisations. Further sections will be opened up along Norfolk’s coast over the next couple of years, joining work in neighbouring regions. With new funding recently announced to accelerate the roll out of the England coast path it’s a hugely exciting time for England’s coastline. Environment Minister Dan Rogerson said: Norfolk has an incredible coastline, with beautiful beaches, dunes and cliff top views. Now that the first part of Norfolk’s Coastal Path is open, more and more people will be able to enjoy this breath-taking part of the country. Being rolled out nationwide, the English Coastal Path will improve access to coastlines across the country and boost local tourism helping to build a stronger economy and fairer society. Toby Coke, Chairman of Norfolk County Council’s Environment, Development and Transport Committee said: Our existing network of footpaths and trails already contribute millions of pounds to our economy each year. Our Norfolk coastline, which is some of the best coastline in the country, officially being designated as part of the England Coast Path can only boost visitor numbers further and benefit businesses along the route. A sponsored walk is being held by HM Coastguard Norfolk teams on part of the new route to raise funds for Guide Dogs for the Blind. HM Coastguard rescued 230 dogs from the coastline in 2014, and so far this year, Norfolk teams have been involved in the rescue of 15 dogs. The Mundesley and Happisburgh coast guard teams will be walking from Sea Palling to Trimingham, and the Sheringham and Cromer teams walking from Weybourne to Trimingham. Tony Garbutt, north Norfolk manager for the Maritime and Coastguard Agency added; The walk today will help build our knowledge of the route and, raise enough money to sponsor a guide dog for each team as well as support a charity close to our hearts. Understanding our coastline and getting to know this new route is vital and will assist us in our work. The coastguards intend to walk the whole of the route that passes through north Norfolk in the coming months.

This is the first stretch in Norfolk. Two stretches were opening in April 2014 in Cumbria and the north east. The first stretch opened in Weymouth in Dorset, in time for people to view the sailing events for the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. It is envisaged that, over the next 2 years, work will have started or been completed on 17 stretches of England’s coastline, totalling in excess of 1,000 km. This national infrastructure project is being established with a low cost input, and it will open up new business opportunities for coastal communities. The England Coast Path is a good example of generating more money for local economies at a low cost. The England Coast Path timetable 2014 September 2014: proposals from Whitehaven to Silecroft (55 km) in Cumbria were published and submitted to Government for approval September 2014: proposals from Camber to Folkestone (48 km) in Kent were published and submitted to Government for approval October 2014: proposals from Hopton on Sea to Sea Palling (31 km) in north Norfolk were published and submitted to Government for approval Winter 2015: Proposals from Filey Brigg to North Gare (130 km) along the north east coast will be published and submitted to government for approval More details and maps are available on Natural England’s coastal access web pages ."

/government/news/uk-secures-fair-fisheries-deal-in-europe,"Deal strikes the right balance between supporting business and conserving fish stocks.  UK secures fair fisheries deal in Europe  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs The UK government has delivered a fair deal for fishermen today, striking the right balance between supporting businesses and conserving fish stocks to safeguard the future livelihoods of our fishing fleets and their local communities. This follows negotiations at the annual EU Fisheries and Agriculture Council where fishing quotas for 2015 were agreed. Decisions were based on three clear principles: following the available scientific advice; achieving sustainable levels of fishing; and reducing discards. The government entered negotiations facing challenging proposals from the Commission for precautionary reductions in the quotas of many stocks, but important increases were agreed for many parts of the UK’s fishing fleet. This includes increases to cod and haddock in the North Sea, Nephrops (prawns) in the Celtic Sea, sole in the Western Channel and angler (monkfish) and haddock in the West of Scotland. Where the latest scientific evidence supported it, we were also able to lobby against unjustifiable cuts proposed by the Commission. Instead we ensured quotas were looked at on a case-by-case basis, achieving a rollover of current 2014 catch levels to provide stability for the fishermen who rely on these species, including skates and rays around the UK. The government also successfully resisted further reductions to days at sea under the cod recovery plan. This will give fishermen the time they need to fish more selectively and avoid discarding perfectly good fish. Finally, despite pressing hard for measures to address declining sea bass levels we were disappointed not to leave negotiations with an agreement on specific measures to tackle this issue. The UK government has led on action to improve these stocks and has now secured a commitment from the Commission to work with Member States to reduce fishing pressure at the start of the season in 2015. Commenting from Brussels UK Fisheries Minister George Eustice said: Although these were difficult negotiations, I am pleased that we were able to secure the best possible deal to ensure sustainable fisheries and a strong UK fishing industry. While fishermen had feared there would be major cuts from the Commission, by bringing new science to the table we were able to keep the same quota as last year for many species, including monkfish, megrim and pollock in the South West and skates and rays around the UK. This was in addition to important increases to North Sea cod and haddock quota which will benefit Scottish fishermen. In some cases there are still some reductions in quota, but I entered these discussions with the firm belief that any decisions need to support our shared goals of a thriving fishing industry, sustainable fish stocks and a healthy marine environment. If we want a long-term future for our industry we have to listen to the available science and agree fishing opportunities which support the sustainability of our stocks. I was disappointed no decision was reached this year to improve bass stocks but will be following up on the Commission’s commitment to work with Member States in the New Year. The UK has been a lone voice on this issue and it is essential we achieve a balanced approach which reflects the contribution of both commercial fisheries as well as recreational anglers on declining bass numbers. Given the start of the pelagic discard ban in January 2015 the UK also ensured next year’s total allowable catch took into account the ban on discarding fish, a crucial agreement following UK-led reforms to the Common Fisheries Policy last year. In addition a commitment was obtained from the Commission to undertake research to improve flexibility, allowing fishermen to use quota across regions in light of the discard ban and increased selectivity. The UK also successfully negotiated a number of further concessions. These include: Days at sea kept at 2014 levels rather than reduced. Increased quota for fishermen in many areas, including the following: North Sea: 5% cod,15% Nephrops (prawns), 15% plaice North Sea and West Scotland : 6% haddock, 20% angler (monkfish) Irish Sea: Nephrops (prawns) 3% Around the UK: hake 11% Reducing cuts to a number of important fish quotas by providing sound scientific evidence to the Council. Including: Celtic Sea: 64% cut to cod reduced to 26% and 41% cut to haddock reduced to 12% Eastern Channel: 60% cut to sole reduced to 28% Bristol Channel: 35% cut to sole reduced to 15% As well as maintaining 2014 quotas for a number of stocks, including: Irish Sea: haddock South West: angler (monkfish), megrim Bristol Channel: plaice North Sea: megrim, dab and flounder, sole and ling And accepting proposals for cuts where necessary to protect stocks, including: Celtic Sea: 30% cut to herring, 26% cut to cod and 12% North Sea: 5% herring, 15% saithe. The Fisheries Minister George Eustice represented the UK in Brussels to ensure a package of measures that reflected the interests of all parts of the country. Richard Lochhead and Michelle O’Neill also attended for Scotland and Northern Ireland, respectively. The negotiations were the culmination of months of UK government-led meetings to hear from fishermen, devolved administrations, scientists and environmental NGOs to secure the best possible deal in order to meet our shared goals of a thriving fishing industry, sustainable fish stocks and a healthy marine environment. Fishermen in the North East and Scotland also benefitted from the formal acceptance of our early agreements with Norway on fishing opportunities in the North Sea where we secured a quota rise in haddock and cod – the second successive rise in two years. Negotiations with the Faroe Islands to deliver additional quota and opportunities to catch a number of species in Faroese waters were also agreed at Council today."

The oil dispersed naturally well away from the shore and the UK-Norway median line, and there has been no evidence of any significant environmental impact to date resulting from this release. An oil sheen on the sea surface was observed by Shell personnel on Wednesday 10th August, and my Department was notified on the same day that a leak had ocurred. A DECC inspector was in regular communication with Shell from that point. On the evening of August 11th, DECC was notified that the release had stopped. However Shell provided DECC with further aerial surveillance information late on the afternoon of Friday 12th and it became clear that the release was continuing and that there was potential for significant pollution. The Secretary of State’s Representative for Maritime Salvage and Intervention (SoSREP) was immediately notified and he mobilised to Shell’s headquarters on Saturday 13th August . A team from DECC and Marine Scotland was assembled at Shell’s offices to attend an operations meeting that afternoon, with the SoSREP formally establishing an Operations Control Unit at Shell’s office at 09.00 am on Sunday 14th August. The role of the SoSREP is to represent the Secretaries of State for the Department of Energy and Climate Change (in relation to offshore installations) and Department for Transport (in relation to ships) to ensure the risk to safety, property and the UK environment arising from accidents involving ships, fixed or floating platforms or sub-sea infrastructure is eliminated or effectively reduced. In the case of an offshore oil release, the SoSREP monitors the operator’s response to a pollution incident and, if he deems necessary, has powers to give directions and to take such other actions as may be required where there is or may be a risk of significant pollution. The SoSREP is empowered to make crucial and often time-critical decisions, without delay and without recourse to higher authority, where such decision are in the overriding public interest. The SoSREP has been in close contact with DECC and the Scottish Government Ministers throughout. On 14th August, a survey by a remotely operated vehicle confirmed that the initial leak had been stopped, but a second, smaller, leak was continuing. The survey also discovered that the pipeline bundle, within which the oil flow-line was contained, had lifted from the seabed in a number of places. Action to halt the continuing small leak had to be deferred until the pipeline could be stabilised. With the approval of the SoSREP, Shell partially stabilised the pipeline by laying concrete mattresses on it, and the second leak was then halted on 19th August. The Operations Control Unit remains in place and the SoSREP is continuing to work with Shell as they develop plans to remove the remaining inventory in the pipeline (estimated at 660 tonnes of oil). Although this incident is in no way comparable with major pollution incidents such as the Gulf of Mexico - in the case of Macondo it is estimated that 4,900,000 barrels of oil were released to sea, the Gannet release equates to 1,300 barrels - this is nevertheless the largest oil release on the UKCS in over a decade. My Department and the Health and Safety Executive have commenced investigations into the cause of the incident, which are likely to take some months. A full report will be sent to the Procurator Fiscal to consider whether a prosecution is appropriate. 1 It is difficult and takes time to get an accurate assessment of the size of a release and this is subject to ongoing revision."

This financial year renewable energy developers have announced plans in Northern Ireland for £46m investment, with the potential to create as many as 450 jobs, as the nation begins to realise its huge economic potential and produce clean, home grown energy. Speaking at an annual conference of the renewables industry, The Rt Hon Chris Huhne MP will today hail renewable energy sources like wind, wave and biomass as already delivering a “third industrial revolution” across the UK. Huhne will cite progress in the last six months, where industry has announced plans to invest £1.7bn and create over 9,000 jobs “from the Western Isles to the Isle of Wight”. The Energy Secretary will say: “Renewable energy technologies will deliver a third industrial revolution. Its impact will be every bit as profound as the first two. “The revolution has already begun, from the Western Isles to the Isle of Wight. Across the length and breadth of Britain, new companies are creating new jobs and delivering the technologies that will power our future. “At a time when closures and cuts dominate the news cycle, next-generation industries are providing jobs and sinking capital into Britain. “I want to take aim at the curmudgeons and faultfinders who hold forth on the impossibility of renewables.

This is a substantial… Report of the US National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill and offshore drilling: Written Ministerial Statement by Charles Hendry  Closed organisation: Department of Energy & Climate Change The US National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling delivered its final report yesterday. This is a substantial document, both in its scope and in the careful detail of its analysis and recommendations. It will of course be reviewed carefully by my Department and all other relevant bodies within Government, to identify the implications from this tragic incident in the Gulf of Mexico for the regulation of deepwater drilling in the UK. We will be working closely with the industry, our colleagues in HSE and the MCA to ensure that any lessons to be learned from this report are understood and effectively communicated throughout companies working in the UKCS. This will take time. Nevertheless, there are some key points which emerge even at this early stage. While noting that the precise contribution of specific actions to the disaster remains to some degree uncertain, the report confirms earlier information on the root causes of the accident. The report makes comprehensive recommendations for the US offshore regulatory regime, including: A new approach to risk assessment and management, with regular third party audits of management systems; A new independent agency responsible for safety and environmental regulation of offshore drilling; Stronger environmental regulation and enforcement; A reorientation of oil spill response and containment planning; and A revision of liability rules. The regulatory system in the Gulf of Mexico at the time of the incident was of course very different from that which we maintain in the UK and is employed in the North Sea in general. And indeed the report recommends the adoption in the US of a risk-based performance approach similar to the safety case approach in the North Sea. It also recommends the development of plans and procedures for responding to a “Spill of National Significance” which is an approach already reflected in our National Contingency Plan. As regards environmental assessment we have a comprehensive suite including Strategic Environmental Assessment, project specific Environmental Impact Assessments and Habitats Directive assessments. But notwithstanding these strengths of our existing system, we are committed to learning what we can from the Commission’s findings and recommendations, and, where appropriate, applying that learning on the UKCS. And we have already acted, in the light of the emerging information from the many investigations into the disaster, to strengthen where we can what is already one of the most robust environmental and safety regimes in the world. As announced by the Secretary of State in May, we conducted an immediate review of our regime and decided to increase the number of offshore environmental inspectors. He also announced yesterday our plans to further increase the number of offshore environmental inspections from 60 to 150 annually. We also required the companies to update their Oil Pollution Emergency Plans, to address the possibility of an uncontrolled blowout. And consents for new drilling operations in deep water, already subject to case by case review, have been required to demonstrate stringently the arrangements for coordination between the various companies engaged, and are subject to individual inspection before drilling commences. At the same time, the industry has been working through the new OSPRAG grouping, with Government participation, to develop new technical solutions which could be deployed to bring any uncontrolled blowout under control as rapidly as possible. Also the OPOL liability pool, which is unique to North Sea operations, has increased its cover from $125 m. to $250 m. OSPRAG is further reviewing the implications of Macondo for the scale of liability cover which would now be appropriate for UKCS conditions. The report highlights the importance of ensuring adequate liability arrangements are in place to better protect victims and provide appropriate incentives to industry. Some of the recommendations in this area address particular circumstances in the US, including a limit on the liability of drilling operators. There is no such limit in the UK - the liability of companies for the consequences of their actions is subject to no statutory restriction. And the existence of the OPOL liability pool provides a globally unique, and very substantial, assurance that victims would be adequately protected. However, this is an area on which the Select Committee has also made recommendations and in which the European Commission has proposed further work. We will continue to work with industry and with European partners to see how further improvements could be made. I should add that we welcome the stress placed by the Presidential Commission on international collaboration and cooperation in developing the most effective approaches to meeting the challenges of ensuring safe and environmentally responsible conduct of offshore drilling operations. As the Commission recognises, the industry is truly a global one, and we wish to draw on all the expertise, in industry and in regulators around the world, and in particular with the US Administration, to make these operations as safe as we can. As the Secretary of State made clear in May, we intend to review the UK’s oil & gas offshore regulatory regime against the findings of the US investigations. This review will begin within a month, once the report of the National Commission has been thoroughly analysed. It will be carried through by DECC, the Health and Safety Executive and the Marine Coast Guard Agency, and will be based on the full life cycle of an offshore development thus ensuring that all activities are covered. The review will report later this year, once the US Maritime Board investigation report - currently expected in March 2011 - has been published and the details analysed."

Mr Shaw said: “Following the successful closure of the valve by Shell UK on Friday, Shell now plan to continue to secure the pipeline to protect it from the threat of storm or tidal damage. Following discussions over the weekend, last night I advised Shell that I am satisfied with their proposals to complete operations to secure with concrete mattresses sections of pipeline that are raised from the sea bed. “The operation began at first light this morning and weather permitting, this is expected to be completed over the next 36 hours. “Planning is now underway for the safe and timely removal of the gas and oil remaining in the damaged pipeline. “Dedicated UK Government aerial surveillance aircraft continue to monitor the GANNET Field and surrounding areas.” At 08:10 this morning the surveillance aircraft observed a sheen on the water of 200m x 50m and maximum estimated quantity of 0.002 tonnes. The sheen has dispersed naturally. SOSREP is satisfied that this sheen was as a result of dredging operations 3kms from the mattressing operation which have been ongoing, as part of Shell’s inspections, to identify precisely the source of the original leak. Shell have now suspended the dredging operation until all the mattresses are laid. Forty-five mattresses are now in place. Surveillance using both fixed wing aircraft and satellite is ongoing with no further sheens observed. Notes for editors Hugh Shaw is the Secretary of State’s Representative for Maritime Salvage and Intervention (SOSREP). The role of the SOSREP is to represent the Secretaries of State for the Department of Energy and Climate Change (in relation to offshore installations) and Department for Transport (in relation to ships) by removing or reducing the risk to safety, property and the UK environment arising from accidents involving ships, fixed or floating platforms or sub-sea infrastructure. The SOSREP monitors the operator’s response to a pollution incident and if he deems necessary, has powers to give directions and to take such other actions as may be required to prevent or minimise pollution or the threat of pollution. The SOSREP is empowered to make crucial and often time-critical decisions, without delay and without recourse to higher authority, where such decisions are in the overriding public interest."

The latest survey shows a few sections are lying just above the sea floor but operations continue to add additional mats to reduce the risk further. “A slight sheen was reported in the area yesterday morning and I believe it is inevitable that further sheens will be seen as we move to the dredging and inspection phase of the operation and oil is released from sediment on the sea floor. “Dredging and inspection operations to try and ascertain the precise source of the original leak commenced earlier today. Weather permitting, these operations may take three to four days to complete. “On completion the data will be analysed to assist the engineers consider their future options for the safe removal of the remaining hydrocarbons from the pipeline.” Notes for editors Hugh Shaw is the Secretary of State’s Representative for Maritime Salvage and Intervention (SOSREP).

Global Threat Reduction Programme: US Elimination of Weapons Grade Plutonium Production Programme  Closed organisation: Department of Energy & Climate Change A major Global Partnership non-proliferation objective has been to close down the three former Soviet weapons-grade plutonium-producing reactors in Russian Siberia. In addition to a combined production capacity of over 1.2 metric tonnes of weapons-grade plutonium a year, the three reactors also provided heat and power to the closed nuclear cities of Zheleznogorsk and Seversk. Replacement power supplies had to be made available before the reactors could be shut down. The US-led Elimination of Weapons Grade Plutonium Production Programme has refurbished one fossil fuel power plant and constructed a new efficient coal-fired plant.

We are doing everything we can to help these skilled people to find new posts, and are working with the Thurrock Council taskforce, local agencies and Jobcentre Plus to ensure they get the support they need at this difficult time.  There is however some comfort in this announcement for the local community.  Vopak, Greenergy and Shell have committed to investing a substantial amount in the site to develop it as a state-of-the-art import terminal. This includes paying for enhancements to the infrastructure that will keep the site viable for many years. As a result, the UK will have a new import terminal and its first deep water product jetty. This will allow low-cost high quality diesel to be imported, thereby enhancing  security of supply for London and the South East, and more affordable prices at the pumps. The construction and operation of the terminal should also create significant economic activity in the region over the next 2-3 years.  Vopak estimate that up to 50 direct jobs could be supported at the terminal. But, there will be much wider knock-on effects, with additional jobs available for contractors with skills in maintenance, security, engineering, truck driving and construction. To continue operating as a refinery, some hundreds of millions would have needed  to be invested in the plant, and unfortunately this has presented a huge barrier to potential new owners to invest because of the costs involved.  The site is of exceptional value as an import terminal because of its location and amenities, so it is not surprising that it has had a higher sale value as an import terminal, which does not also require the extra investment a refinery would need."

At today’s meeting, representatives discussed the future options for the refinery and the work the administrators are doing to secure a sustainable future for the plant. The Minister reiterated Government’s commitment to help those workers who are at risk of losing their jobs if the refinery closes. He also set out the broader context of overcapacity in the refining industry and declining demand for petrol in the UK and Europe. The meeting also focussed on what Government and local partners doing, alongside the administrators, to safeguard as many local jobs as possible. Charles Hendry said: “From the outset of this process, we have worked tirelessly with the administrator to find a way to secure a successful outcome for Coryton and to safeguard local jobs. “It is extremely disappointing that the administrators have not found a buyer for the refinery, despite their strong efforts. .Unfortunately considerable additional investment is needed to keep the refinery operating efficiently, and this has meant that potential bidders have been faced with high upfront investments to make in the order of some hundreds of millions. “In addition, UK refineries face tough competition from other refineries in Europe and increasingly in Asia, which means that profit margins are low and there is overcapacity in the sector.  It is clearly a very tough market and these conditions on their own make the sale of Coryton as a refinery challenging. “We looked long and hard at whether or not State Aid should be provided for Coryton. But, we came to the conclusion that the existing overcapacity in the refining industry and declining demand for petrol means that it would not be sustainable. “If Government did step in to help Coryton, this would be a short-term fix, and it could potentially lead to job losses at other refineries who would be at an unfair disadvantage. “We realise this is a really worrying time for those who work at the refinery in Coryton, for their families and their communities more generally. We will be doing whatever we can to support people through this difficult period. “If it is not possible to find someone keen to take forward this investment as a business then Government is committed to help Thurrock Council and its taskforce through a range of different government departments, to make sure we mitigate the job losses as best as we can. “To this end, we are already working closely with local agencies and Jobcentre Plus to ensure the right support is in place to help these skilled workers find new posts.” Background Information on UK downstream oil industry    "

Market abuse is always wrong - but at a time when people and companies are struggling with high energy bills, the country would expect us to take firm action if these allegations prove true, and we will. These allegations of market manipulation are being taken very seriously. We will support the regulators taking whatever steps necessary to ensure that the full force of the law is applied, if they are true, so that any guilty parties are held to account. In the first instance, the Financial Services Authority (FSA) and Ofgem will consider these allegations. Ofgem has the lead responsibility for these physical markets, with the FSA leading on any associated financial market. Both regulators have already committed significant resources to doing so. I and my officials have been in close contact with both regulators over the weekend, and we continue to support them in their work in whatever way we can. The assessment of the allegations is however at an early stage. The FSA and Ofgem are examining the evidence they received and as this evidence may be used in criminal and/or civil proceedings it is important not to pre-empt the work of the FSA and Ofgem, or their conclusions. At this stage, we encourage any individuals or companies to act on any concerns that they have and bring forward any evidence of market manipulation. People should know that the powers exist to protect the identity of a whistleblower, although in this instance the individual concerned has chosen to forego his anonymity. Both Ofgem and the FSA are market regulators, independent of Government and staffed by market experts. Together with the Office of Fair Trading (OFT), these organisation have a range of powers available to them, including acting against: manipulation of financial markets; collusive activity; and abuse of strong market positions. The Government has a strong record of providing regulators with the powers that they need to tackle market abuse. Where regulators and others have identified gaps in their powers, we have acted quickly to address them. For example, Government acted swiftly to tackle the attempted manipulation of LIBOR and EURIBOR, by implementing in full the recommendations of the Wheatley Review, including the statutory regulation of benchmark activities. We also responded to Ofgem’s requests to extend its powers to tackle abuses that take advantage of network constraints. The Government has also undertaken a wholesale review of how competition law is applied in the UK, ensuring that it is fit for purpose, and that it can tackle collusion and abuse of strong market positions. The UK Government has also taken a leading role in the development of the EU’s Regulation on Wholesale Energy Markets Integrity and Transparency - often referred to as REMIT. The prohibitions on insider trading and market manipulation came into force in December 2011. This will ensure that regulatory bodies across the EU are able to tackle any such abuse in wholesale energy markets. The UK was already aiming to be one of the first countries to implement REMIT in full and Government has been working with Ofgem over the past few months on the detailed implementation of these powers. Yet if it were to prove to be the case that the existing wide ranging powers to tackle market abuse and these new REMIT powers are insufficient, I have written to the FSA, Ofgem and the OFT, asking them to identify any remaining gaps in their powers to deal with allegations of this sort. At this early stage in the investigation it is not possible to understand what the impact on consumers, companies or markets may have been, if the allegations are proven to be true. Yet I can assure the House of our absolute determination to clamp down on any abuse that is uncovered, wherever and by whoever. For now, it is right and proper to allow the independent market regulators to proceed with their investigations, with our full support. And Mr Speaker, I will commit now to update this house when we learn more.  "

Flagship project for East Midlands Housing Association for a ‘hard to treat’ home  Closed organisation: Department of Energy & Climate Change East Midlands Housing Association (EMHA), is an independent, not-for-profit organisation providing homes for people unable to buy or rent on the open market.  The organisation has been working closely with local authorities and specialised agencies to provide homes to address a wide range of needs and they now have over 6000 affordable homes available for families, the elderly and those requiring additional support. The specific challenge with this project, was to find a cost effective solution for a detatched house with circa 1900s thermal insulation values. Also key, was to modernise the house, keeping some of the original features, but without the need for decamping or significant disruption to the tenant and their family. Mark Group had already worked closely with EMHA to install over 100 measures of loft and cavity wall insulation in their housing stock. However, EMHA were not aware of alternative methods of insulation for their hard to treat homes, so following an inspection of the property, Mark Group offered them the chance to try an External Wall Insulation System (EWI).  The technical team proposed that a Alumasc Swisslab External Wall Insulation system was the best solution for the property and in May 2009, the works commenced. The work itself took 12 working days to complete (the tenant continued to live in the property during the works) and has been an unqualified success.  Prior to the work commencing, the thermal performance of the property was 2.14W/m2k. Post installation the thermal performance of the property was up to current building regulations, 0.35w/m2k. Furthermore, the work has eliminated issues with damp, condensation and maintenance."

/government/news/uk-s-oil-stocking-system-to-be-reviewed,"The future of the UK’s oil stocking system is being considered by a consultation launched by Government today. UK’s oil stocking system to be reviewed  Closed organisation: Department of Energy & Climate Change Press Release 2013/035 The future of the UK’s oil stocking system is being considered by a consultation launched by Government today. Views are being invited on whether the present obligation on suppliers to hold stocks is the most efficient model or if an alternative system such as centralised stocking agency, similar to that of other EU member states, would be more appropriate. Energy and Climate Change Secretary Edward Davey said: “The UK has a strong history ensuring a resilient and responsive oil stocking system that meets our international obligations and provides energy security. “A large part of that success has been the close working relationship we have with industry. We are launching this consultation to ensure our oil stocking system continues to follow best practice, remains fit for purpose and provides the foundation to a vibrant UK oil industry.” As a member state of the EU and the International Energy Agency (IEA), the UK is required to hold emergency oil stocks for use in an oil supply disruption. UK Petroleum Industry Association (UKPIA) represents oil refining and marketing companies in the UK and Director General Chris Hunt said: “UKPIA today welcomes the Consultation on UK’s Compulsory Stocking, and would support the establishment of an independent stockholding agency to manage the CSO going forward. We welcome DECC’s commitment to examine the case for this approach, and look forward to responding to this key consultation.” The Downstream Fuel Association (DFA) represents UK fuel supply chain companies and Chief Executive Teresa Sayers said: “The DFA supports the Government’s oil stocking consultation and in particular DECC’s consideration of a centralised stocking agency. This is a unique opportunity to ensure the UK finds the most cost effective way to comply with its international oil stocking obligations.” Notes for Editors The consultation can be found on the GOV.UK website Responses are requested no later than 7 June 2013 and should be emailed to deccdownstreamoilteam@decc.gsi.gov.uk or, if in hard copy, to David Rolfe Department for Energy and Climate Change (Area 3E), 3 Whitehall Place, London, SW1A 2HD. The Compulsory Stocking Obligation in numbers: An EU Member State, under the terms of the Oil Stocking Directive, is required to hold oil stocks at the high of 90 days of average net daily imports or 61 days of average daily inland consumption. Members of the International Energy Agency (IEA) commit to maintain emergency oil reserves equivalent to at least 90 days of net imports. The same stocks can be used to meet both obligations so in practice the UK must meet the largest. The UK is an oil producer, which reduces reliance on daily imports, so the highest obligation the UK must currently meet is the EU requirement of 61 days of average consumption. Official published figures in Energy Trends March 2013 showed the UK had stocks equal to around 84 days of average consumption. Companies must supply at least 50,000 tonnes of oil to the UK market in order to be obligated. Since 2006 refiners are required to hold 67.5 days of stock whereas non-refiners (including importers and significant traders) are required to hold 58 days of stocks (primarily due to different operational models). Under the terms of the Oil Stocking Order 2012, obligated companies are required to hold at least 1/3rd of their oil stocks in the form of one or more particular product categories.

The Electricity and Gas (Market Integrity and Transparency) (Enforcement etc.) Regulations 2013  Closed organisation: Department of Energy & Climate Change On 13 November 2012, following allegations of market manipulation in wholesale gas markets, I promised to update the House on implementation the EU Regulation on wholesale electricity and gas market integrity and transparency (REMIT). REMIT prohibits insider dealing and market abuse in wholesale energy markets across Europe and establishes a monitoring regime for wholesale energy trading. It also requires Member States to put in place an enforcement and penalty regime for breaches of the Regulation. I have today laid The Electricity and Gas (Market Integrity and Transparency) (Enforcement etc.) Regulations 2013 which will enter into force on 29 June. They give Ofgem powers to take action against market manipulation in wholesale electricity and gas market, including the power to impose unlimited fines in the case of breaches of the Regulations. Similar regulations will be laid for Northern Ireland. The UK will be one of the first Member States to implement REMIT. Ofgem and the FCA are continuing their analysis of the allegations into manipulation of the gas markets raised in November 2012."

/government/case-studies/bentley-motors-solar-pv-rooftop-array,"The Bentley Motors Factory has the UK’s largest rooftop solar PV array with 20,000 solar PV panels generating enough electricity to power 1,200 households  Bentley Motors: Solar PV rooftop array  Closed organisation: Department of Energy & Climate Change The Bentley Factory in Crewe built in the 1940s is ideally situated to generate solar power as the “saw tooth” factory roofs are south facing at an angle of 20 degrees. It is the UK’s largest rooftop solar PV array, owned and operated by solar power generator, Lightsource Renewable Energy and was installed in March 2013. Over 20,000 solar PV panels have been installed generating enough electricity adequate to power over 1,200 households covering 3.45 hectares of roof space which would otherwise be un-utilised. Lightsource Renewable Energy entered into a power purchase agreement with Bentley Motors, making it possible for the electricity generated during working hours to be used directly by the factory and for the electricity generated at weekends and times of low demand, to be fed back into the National Grid. At peak generation times, the system will produce up to 40% of Bentley’s energy requirements. Of their solar success Michael Straughan, Bentley’s Member of the Board for Manufacturing, said: The solar panels have generated over 2,200,000 kWh’s of energy since its installation in March, having a hugely positive impact on the efficiency and sustainability of our manufacturing operations. We’re very proud of the project … Minister Greg Barker visited the site following the launch of the UK first solar pv roadmap in October 2013 . Greg Barker talks about the Bentley Motors array and his ambition for solar pv The installation on Bentley’s factory demonstrates the potential for solar energy to be generated on commercial roof-tops in the UK and is a clear example of how businesses can gain greater pricing certainty for the future whilst reducing their carbon footprint. With the build only taking 16 weeks, it shows the speed at which installations of this size can be completed even when constructed in tandem with existing business activity. Bentley Motors employs around 4,000 people in Crewe which is home to all its operations including design, R&D, engineering and production. The combination of fine craftsmanship, using skills that have been handed down through generations, alongside engineering expertise and cutting-edge technology is unique to UK luxury vehicle manufacturers such as Bentley. It is also an example of high-value British manufacturing. Bentley exports over £1bn worth of goods in 2012. The company is the third largest R&D investor in the UK’s automotive sector and the 18th largest nationally."

The staff and their families have been through a very stressful and uncertain time. They have been through a hell of a week and I hope they have a much better weekend as a result of today’s announcement. They can look to the future with an optimism which was absent earlier in the week. This is the outcome we have worked towards and one which Scotland and Grangemouth deserve. There are undoubtedly lessons to be learned from this dispute but for now we should focus on the immediate success of securing the site’s future. The joint talks at Ineos yesterday have been just one part of the UK Government’s efforts to find a solution to this crisis. The UK Guarantee for the new ethane facility is an important part of the discussions and the plant will be a key part of the company’s plans for the future. Mr Carmichael confirmed at a meeting with Ineos yesterday that the UK Government agrees the Grangemouth ethane project remained prequalified under the UK Guarantees Scheme."

/government/speeches/gas-market-update,"Edward Davey statement to Parliament on allegations of manipulation of the UK gas market. Gas market update  Closed organisation: Department of Energy & Climate Change Almost a year ago I informed Parliament that my Department and the Treasury had just been notified about allegations of manipulation of the UK gas market. As I said at that time, I take these allegations extremely seriously. Market abuse is always wrong, and where it exists it must be identified and the full force of the law applied. The specific allegations were that there had been manipulation of the gas market in Great Britain on 28 September 2012. These allegations concerned trading on that day in the period leading up to 4.30pm, when price reporting agencies produce a benchmark price for the day. Such benchmark prices are often used in a range of other contracts. It was alleged that gas was sold at a lower price than necessary, in order to manipulate downwards the benchmark price produced by price reporting agencies. As is right and proper, these allegations were scrutinised by the independent regulators for the affected sectors. Ofgem has the lead responsibility for the physical energy markets, with the FCA leading on financial markets. The reviews entailed detailed analysis of relevant information in order to understand the market conditions and the trading positions of relevant market participants, including contracts priced by reference to price reporting agencies closing prices. Both reviews have now concluded. Both regulators concluded that they could find no evidence in this instance of market manipulation, and Ofgem considers that the interests of energy consumers were therefore not harmed. They consider that the explanations provided by the sellers for the relevant trades are credible, and they have not found evidence which disputes the explanations provided. In light of this, they conclude that no further action is required in connection with these allegations. Regardless of the outcome of these particular allegations I am fully committed to ensuring we have a transparent energy market where the risk of abuse is reduced. If any abuse does take place, it must be identified and robustly dealt with. The Government has a strong record of providing regulators with the powers they need to tackle market abuse, and we will continue to take further action where necessary. We took a leading role in developing the EU regulation on wholesale energy market integrity and transparency – known as REMIT. REMIT prohibits insider trading and market manipulation in wholesale energy markets across the EU and has been in force since 28 December 2011. The UK was one of the first countries to implement REMIT in full, when we put in place civil powers to allow the regulator to tackle manipulation of the energy markets, in June 2013. In view of the importance of the energy markets set out in the Annual Energy Statement I now plan to consult on the introduction of criminal sanctions for energy market manipulation activities. Ofgem continues to monitor wholesale energy markets, and has an established whistleblower policy to encourage people to bring any examples of market abuse to its attention. REMIT already requires those organising transactions in wholesale markets to report suspicious trades to Ofgem. Ofgem is also working with European colleagues to further develop our cross-border REMIT market monitoring systems. The allegations in this case were that prices used by Price Reporting Agencies were manipulated. We need confidence that there is a rigorous price assessment process, providing a fair assessment of the market. Ofgem therefore ran a call for evidence on benchmarks in gas and electricity sectors on: potential risks; whether the current processes are fit for purpose; and whether further action is necessary. Ofgem is currently analysing the responses received. It will be for Ofgem to set out their approach, but if action is warranted their responses could range from facilitating effective self-regulation by PRAs, to more significant regulatory interventions. Whatever approach is adopted must take account of international initiatives in this area. PRAs are already implementing Principles for oil benchmarks developed by the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) at the G20’s request. We are working within the EU to ensure that any new regulation of PRAs under their proposed Benchmarks Regulation enhances the robustness of energy benchmarks. Transparency in the energy market is another important element of our overall approach to deterring market abuse. That is why I have asked Ofgem to carry out a detailed assessment of energy suppliers’ financial reporting practices and set out the necessary steps to improve transparency. This assessment will be delivered by Spring 2014. In addition, the Prime Minister has announced that Ofgem, OFT and the new Competition Markets Authority will lead a new annual review into the state of the competition of the market. Ofgem and FCA work independently of Government to ensure that regulations are not being breached. In this case, they have concluded that they could find no evidence of manipulation and Ofgem considers the interests of consumers have therefore not been harmed. But it is right and proper that they continue to be vigilant and we will continue to support them by ensuring the right regulatory framework is in place and that there are appropriate deterrents."

Rhum North Sea gas field to restart production  Closed organisation: Department of Energy & Climate Change The government has taken the necessary steps to allow BP to restart production on the Rhum gas field in the North Sea. Ownership of Rhum is shared equally between BP and the Iranian Oil Company (IOC). Rhum and its neighbouring fields make an important contribution to the UK’s long-term energy security which is responsible for up to four percent of the UK’s annual gas production. Gas production from the Rhum field was stopped in 2010 in relation to international sanctions against Iran. The government supports restarting production at Rhum, which is necessary to avoid potential environmental damage and to prevent the possible destruction of the value of the field. IOC will receive its share of the revenues from gas sales at Rhum. As IOC is currently designated under EU Iran sanctions, these will be placed in a frozen account. The government will be working closely with the company’s co-licensee, BP, and BP’s contractors on the field to ensure that production can resume. Notes for Editors The Hydrocarbons (Temporary Management Scheme) Regulations 2013 allows the Secretary of State to apply a temporary scheme to the hydrocarbons interests of a listed person which holds a relevant licence where he is satisfied that this is necessary (i) to avoid or remediate environmental damage; or (ii) to prevent permanent destruction of the value of the relevant licence. The government will co-manage the Rhum field from 22 October 2013. Temporary administration will continue until the expiry of the licence in March 2018 or if circumstances change. On 22 October 2013 DECC took temporary management of the Iranian Oil Company’s share of the Rhum North Sea gas field. In accordance with the Hydrocarbons (Temporary Management Scheme) Regulations 2013, DECC has issued a decision notice in relation to the application of a temporary scheme and has made the notice available for inspection ."

/government/speeches/notification-to-parliament-of-a-contingent-liability-indemnification-to-elexon-ltd-for-electricity-market-reform-settlement-system-set-up,"Statement by Michael Fallon on the indemnification to ELEXON Ltd for electricity market reform settlement system set-up.  Notification to parliament of a contingent liability: indemnification to ELEXON Ltd for electricity market reform settlement system set-up  Closed organisation: Department of Energy & Climate Change The Energy Act 2013 makes provision for Electricity Market Reform (EMR) measures which are intended to ensure sufficient investment comes forward to replace old generation plant with new low carbon generation. The Act enables amendments to the Transmission Licence and the Balancing and Settlement Code (BSC) to allow ELEXON Ltd to undertake settlement functions for EMR. To ensure these functions can be discharged effectively and on time, ELEXON Ltd has begun preparatory work to put in place the necessary arrangements. ELEXON’s existing role, expertise and experience will help ensure that settlement systems are delivered in a manner that reduces administrative burdens for suppliers, for generators, the CfD Counterparty and Capacity Market Settlement Body – thereby reducing costs to consumers. Reflecting the critical nature of this prepatory work, I am writing to inform you of a Departmental Minute which will be presented to Parliament today, giving notice of a contingent liability for the issuing of indemnity provisions to ELEXON Ltd for actions it undertakes during the settlement system set-up phase. We believe it appropriate to offer an indemnity for claims that could arise. This is because ELEXON Ltd is a company that operates on a not-for-profit basis and is funded by parties to the BSC. In the absence of an indemnity, any costs would need to be passed on to the parties to the BSC. As this group is not identical to EMR participants, passing on costs to BSC parties would not be appropriate. The indemnity would cover costs over and above those reclaimed by ELEXON Ltd from insurers or through contractual arrangements with their service providers. The indemnity would not extend to any losses arising where ELEXON Ltd is shown to have been wilfully negligent or for claims brought by employees of ELEXON Ltd. We judge the likelihood of the indemnity being invoked against the Department to be low. It is not possible to provide a meaningful assessment of the scale of the potential liability."

Currently Government issues individual directions to business. There are concerns the present system creates under investment in adequate storage, posing a long-run risk to resilience, and may harm the ability of the UK to meet the CSO in the long run. The policy objective is to ensure that the CSO continues to be met in the future in the UK, as the overall obligation increases in response to declining UKCS production and to ensure the UK holds and can deploy sufficient emergency stocks effectively to mitigate the detrimental impacts on the UK or any oil supply disruption.

/government/consultations/underground-drilling-access,"This is a government consultation on proposals to reform the procedure for gaining underground access to oil or gas deposits and geothermal energy. Underground drilling access  Closed organisation: Department of Energy & Climate Change This is a government consultation on proposals to reform the procedure for gaining underground access to oil or gas deposits and geothermal energy. The consultation examines the existing procedures by which companies who wish to extract oil, gas or geothermal energy obtain access to underground land, and the problems raised by these procedures. The consultation sets out the policy position in relation to underground access rights for shale and geothermal operations. The policy contains three elements: Access rights, Payments for access, and Notification of access. A PowerPoint presentation and stakeholder attendee list for workshops prior to the consultation are also published on GOV.UK. Update We intend to publish a full government response to this consultation in the autumn. Before the consultation closes, we would like to take the opportunity to clarify some of the key points in the consultation document. What is the government consulting on? The government is consulting on proposals designed to facilitate access to underground petroleum (especially shale gas and oil), and deep geothermal energy. The consultation does not seek views on the broader policy of whether or not to develop either the petroleum or geothermal industries in the UK. Nor does it seek views on the potential risks and issues associated with surface works, because the proposed changes would only apply 300 metres or more underground. Responses will be most useful if they are framed in direct response to the questions posed, though further comments and evidence are also welcome. Is conventional oil & gas in scope? The proposals would apply to any underground drilling for the extraction of geothermal energy and petroleum, which covers all oil and gas including conventional oil and gas. Is underground coal gasification (UCG) in scope of the proposals? UCG is not classed as petroleum, as defined in the Petroleum Act, because it uses an industrial process to create gas rather than the gas pre-existing naturally. Because these proposals cover only petroleum and geothermal energy, UCG is not within scope. Is coal bed methane (CBM) in scope of the proposals? CBM requires a Petroleum Licence as this product is defined under the Petroleum Act 1998 and would also require a coal access agreement with the Coal Authority to pass through the coal seam or any non-coal minerals owned by the Coal Authority. CBM is focussed on coal seams, however, if access to underground land outside of a coal seam is required then this currently would require an access agreement from those landowners in possession of that particular piece of land, via the same procedure as oil and gas. Therefore, these proposals on underground access could be used to grant underground access (to land below 300 metres) for the purpose of CBM extraction. The requirements of a Petroleum Licence and coal access agreement would remain unchanged. Is heat recovery from water in disused mines in scope? Great Britain has geothermal potential in mine water, some of which is located at depths greater than 300m. The proposals in the consultation would apply to the extraction of mine water heat at these depths. What will courts consider when making a decision on access under the existing procedure? If individual access negotiations between a landowner and an oil and gas operator fail, the operator can refer the matter to the court via the Secretary of State. The Mines (Working Facilities and Support) Act 1966 allows minerals developers, including the holder of a petroleum licence to obtain a right of access, if certain conditions are met. These conditions (as set out in section 3 of the Mines (Working Facilities and Support) Act 1966) state that a right cannot be granted unless it is not reasonably practicable to obtain the right by private arrangement for any of the following reasons: a) that the persons with power to grant the right are numerous or have conflicting interests b) that the persons with power to grant the right, or any of them, cannot be ascertained or cannot be found c) that the persons from whom the right must be obtained, or any of them, have not the necessary powers of disposition, whether by reason of defect in title, legal disability or otherwise d) that the person with power to grant the right unreasonably refuses to grant it or demands terms which, having regard to the circumstances, are unreasonable The court must also be satisfied that the grant is expedient in the national interest. This procedure has only once been used in respect of petroleum and there is no shale gas or oil-specific precedent due to the nascent stage of the shale industry. This procedure is not applicable to geothermal energy projects. What do the proposals mean in terms of the law of trespass in England, Wales and Scotland? In England and Wales, any unauthorised entry onto privately owned land is a trespass. In Scotland, although trespass is governed by Scottish law, it is similar in that trespass denotes any temporary physical intrusion in the land of another without his permission; it is an infringement of a person’s right to the exclusive use and occupation of his land. The purpose of our proposals is not to change trespass law in England and Wales but the effect of the proposals is that trespass law would not apply to land deeper than 300 metres where a company had obtained an automatic right of access and was in compliance with any conditions attached to that right. In terms of the law of trespass in Scotland, the proposals are the same as in England and Wales and the effect is the same. Interaction with planning in Scotland is the same as it is in England and Wales. What depth would hydraulic fracturing take place at? As set out in the consultation document, it is expected that hydraulic fracturing will typically occur at depths more than a mile down. However, it can take place closer to the surface – this is dependent on the geology of the operation. The Department of Energy and Climate Change holds no view on the merits of operations at different depths. This is for the environmental regulator to assess on a case-by-case basis. Our proposals on access rights are about removing an existing obstacle and would apply to all applicable drilling activities below 300 meters. We consider it appropriate to keep the requirement in place for an operator to agree access with the individual landowners at depths above 300 metres, but this is not intended to preclude activities at these shallower depths."

Don’t be a sucker, SWITCH IT OFF. #VampireEnergy Vampire Energy: Don't be a sucker, switch it off  Closed organisation: Department of Energy & Climate Change Vampires are lurking in homes across the UK. And these are not the kind that can be warned off with garlic, nor are they interested in taking a bite of your neck. These vampires are the type that feed on your electrical sockets and tear through your wallet. These vampires are everyday devices and appliances that suck up electricity even when idle or on standby mode. Don’t be a sucker. Switch it off. Have you ever come home from work and noticed your mobile phone charger is warm, even though it’s not been charging anything all day? Or have you seen that little red standby light on your television, even when the telly’s not on? What about game consoles that are left on once you’ve finished playing? All of these products are leeching unneeded electricity and adding pounds to your electricity bill. And it’s what we call vampire energy. The average household in the UK is wasting £86 a year by leaving products on standby. Don’t be one of them. So, how do you escape the clutches of vampire energy? It’s simple. Don’t be a sucker.

/government/publications/department-of-energy-and-climate-change-powers-of-entry-review,"DECC (with Ofgem where applicable) reviewed its 58 Powers of Entry to meet the requirement in section 42 of the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012. Department of Energy and Climate Change – Powers of Entry Review  Closed organisation: Department of Energy & Climate Change A power of entry is a right for a person (usually a state official such as a police officer, local authority trading standards officer or a member of enforcement staff of a regulatory body) to legally enter defined premises, such as businesses, vehicles or land for specific purposes. On 11 February 2011, the Prime Minister announced the introduction of the Protection of Freedoms Bill as part of the government’s civil liberties and freedoms agenda. The bill received royal assent and became law on 1 May 2012. The act includes reforms to rationalise powers of entry relating to domestic, commercial and other types of premises. The provisions contained in the act provide the ‘tools’ needed to: repeal unnecessary powers of entry add safeguards to powers where they are weak or missing consolidate groups of similar powers to improve transparency, heighten safeguards and remove duplication DECC (with Ofgem where applicable) reviewed its 58 Powers of Entry to meet the requirement in section 42 of the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012. These powers sit across energy and climate change policy, for example: Energy suppliers and network operators have Powers of Entry to maintain their infrastructure; Others are exercised in emergency situations; Some Powers of Entry are used by DECC to monitor the environmental standards of offshore oil and gas facilities. Following the review of the Powers of Entry owned by DECC, six powers were scrapped; two irrelevant powers were identified that cannot be formally repealed or revoked because licences are still in place that rely on them; four powers had additional safeguards added; one new power was introduced; and 45 powers were left unchanged. DECC now has 52 Powers of Entry."
/government/news/development-of-uk-to-norway-electricity-cable-takes-step-forward,"Works associated with the laying of the undersea electricity cable between the UK and Norway have been approved by the MMO. Development of UK to Norway electricity cable takes step forward Marine licences Marine Management Organisation Closed organisation: Department of Energy & Climate Change The Norwegian government gave consent for the development in its waters in October 2014 with the Secretary of State for Climate Change, Ed Davey, commenting on its significance. The high-voltage direct current (HVDC) cable will be the first of its kind between the two countries and will enable the cross-border trading of electricity. Power may flow through the cable in either direction at different times, depending on the supply and demand in each country. The cable will run from Hylen, in southwest Norway, to the Northumberland coast and a converter station in Blyth. Its route in UK waters is expected to be approximately 340km long and it will be buried at depths between 1m and 2m below the seabed. The MMO considered the application, from National Grid NSN Link Limited, under the Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009, in particular section 81, which covers submarine cables. Public consultation on the development took place in Spring 2014, with Northumberland County Council (PDF) also considering applications for land-based activities relating to the development. More details of the case are on the MMO public register (case reference MLA/2013/00436.)"

As a member state of the EU and the International Energy Agency (IEA), the UK is required to hold emergency oil stocks for use in an oil supply disruption. The same stocks can be used to meet both obligations. Currently the EU and IEA obligations are calculated on different bases. The EU obligation is set as 90 days’ average daily national consumption, although as a crude oil producer the UK has a derogation that reduces its obligation by 25% to 67.5 days’ consumption. The IEA obligation is calculated as 90 days of net-imports (plus a 10 per cent exclusion for tank bottoms) and the UK’s current IEA obligation is much smaller than its EU obligation. The latest EU directive will eventually align the EU and IEA obligations on the same net-imports basis. As UK crude oil production declines, the EU derogation will be phased out, and as net-imports increase, the overall UK obligation is expected to increase from about 2016. The UK meets these international obligations by directing companies to hold minimum levels of stocks as part of their commercial stocks. Businesses that supply obligated petroleum products to the UK market are liable to receive an obligation. Current obligations are 67.5 days’ supplies for refiners and 58 days’ for non-refiners. DECC has the UK policy lead for energy emergency preparedness and response covering the operation of oil stocking policy. Our aims for compulsory oil stocking obligations policy are to: set UK and individual company-level compulsory stocking obligations monitor and enforce company-level compliance facilitate a stock release during a supply crisis through agreed temporary reductions in individual obligations, and enforcing these where appropriate improve industry regulatory compliance regulate without taxpayer liability or undue burden on the industry Firm but fair regulatory administration and enforcement of the relevant legislation by DECC officials is an important aspect of achieving these aims."

Two biobed systems were investigated, a lined system (with butyl liner) and an unlined system (without butyl liner). Studies indicated that biobeds can adsorb high concentrations of pesticide and subsequently degrade them. Whilst a proportion of the applied pesticide may leach (less than 0.2%), the amounts leached are likely to be small and similar to leachate from currently available systems (eg Sentinel). Field and semi-field studies showed that the ‘lined’ biobed system is prone to water-logging. The management of water is, therefore, an important factor in the working of the biobed and the current design for a ‘lined’ system is inadequate for the high volumes of waste generated on UK farms. Further studies are required to refine the current design and test it at the pilot stage."

/government/news/warning-after-nearly-200-fish-deaths-on-the-devon-river,"Home owners are being reminded of the dangers of pouring cleaning fluids and other toxic chemicals down drains after a pollution incident. Warning after nearly 200 fish deaths on the Devon river  Environment Agency The Environment Agency was alerted by a member of the public who reported seeing a number of dead fish in a river at Rydon just outside of Holsworthy. Casualties included brown trout, bullhead, lamprey and elvers (baby eels). The pollution was traced to a surface water outfall from a nearby housing estate. “It soon became apparent that whatever killed these fish had come from a nearby housing estate via a surface water drain. It might have been a person using a chemical to clean their patio or drive or someone finding an old can of something in their garage and disposing of it down a drain,’ said John Cossens for the Environment Agency. “We would urge people to act responsibly and take care when using or disposing of chemicals that are toxic to fish and other wildlife. Importantly, don’t assume all drains go to a foul sewer. Often they are part of a surface water system and anything you put down them can end up in a local river,” said John Cossens. The River Deer is a tributary of the River Tamar. The pollution near Rydon affected approximately a 1 km stretch of the river. Whatever killed the fish also wiped out the tiny creatures (invertebrates) upon which the fish and other river life depend. This suggests the pollutant was highly toxic. The Environment Agency is awaiting results of samples taken from the river and from some of the dead fish that have been sent for laboratory analysis. The Environment Agency will shortly be leafleting residents of Rydon reminding them of their responsibilities when using and disposing of potentially toxic chemicals. Members of the public can report pollution incidents by calling a free 24-hour Environment Agency hotline 0800 80 70 60. It helps if people report incidents promptly as this makes it easier to trace and identify a pollution source.

/government/news/appeal-for-information-on-illegally-dumped-waste-in-bedfordshire,"The Environment Agency is appealing for witnesses to a crime after approximately 3,000 cubic metres of waste was dumped in a warehouse.   Appeal for information on illegally dumped waste in Bedfordshire  Environment Agency The amazing discovery was found by the Environment Agency’s specialist waste crime officers after they were called to the warehouse in Dunstable, Bedfordshire. Investigations have revealed that during the nights between Saturday 16 November and Wednesday 20 November last year, around 3,000 cubic metres of waste was dumped illegally inside the warehouse on the former Ecomold site on Luton Road, Dunstable. The criminals gained access by cutting a lorry-sized hole in the side of the warehouse. Tracy Nash, Environmental Crime Team Leader, said: “This is not a matter of small scale fly-tipping, this case appears to be intentional large scale avoidance of disposal costs. “This callous act has endangered the environment and had a costly impact for the land owner. It is vital that we identify where the waste came from and who transferred it to the warehouse. If an innocent party has handed it to a contractor for disposal in good faith then they won’t be in any trouble and may have critical information for us. “The waste must have been taken to the site in several large vehicles, and with the hole having been cut in the side of the warehouse, we’re hopeful that someone may have seen something suspicious, such as tipper lorries or plant machinery on the site in mid November.” The waste will shortly be removed at considerable expense to the landowner. Anyone who has any information can contact the Environment Agency on 0800 807060 quoting CMS 16469 or if they wish to speak in confidence, to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111. Illegal waste sites are a growing problem nationally and the Environment Agency are committed to tackling this criminal activity. These waste sites are unlicensed, operate without any safeguards to the environment and undermine legitimate waste management companies who are undercut by illegal operators. Those responsible for running illegal waste sites can be fined up to £50,000 in Magistrates’ courts, face unlimited fines in higher courts, as well as community punishment orders or prison sentences of up to five years. Illegal dumping costs taxpayers hundreds of thousands of pounds a year in clean up costs. The Environment Agency works in partnership with local authorities and the police to investigate these offences. Further information about how the Environment Agency is cracking down on waste crime .

/government/news/illegal-anglers-caught-fishing-in-norfolk,"Environment Agency bailiffs caught 4 people fishing without a licence when they went out this week in Norfolk.   Illegal anglers caught fishing in Norfolk  Environment Agency Over 2 days, 2 officers checked 49 people and issued 11 offence report forms (ORF) to individuals that were unable to produce a licence on the day (a 22% evasion rate). Lesley Robertson, Environment Agency Environmental Crime Team leader said: ‘These people were all fishing in places where it is legal to fish in the close season and the fact that most had a licence with them shows their commitment to staying within the law. ‘People issued with a form will be hearing from us soon about whether further action will be taken and they may end up with a court summons and a fine up to £2,500’. An annual rod licence for the 2014/15 season remains at 2011 prices, costing £27 for non-migratory trout and char and freshwater (coarse) fish, smelt and eels or £72 for salmon and migratory trout. Concessionary licences, which cost £5, are available to junior anglers (aged 12-16). Anglers under 12 do not require a licence. Anglers over 65 and anyone with a Blue Badge parking concession or in receipt of Disability Living Allowance also pays the concessionary adult rate of £18 (non-migratory trout and char and freshwater (coarse) fish, smelt and eels) and £48 (salmon and migratory trout). One to 8-day licences for occasional anglers are also available for £3.75 and £10 (non-migratory trout and char and freshwater fish and eels) or £8 and £23 (salmon and migratory trout). Licences may be bought from post offices, via the Environment Agency website (www.environment-agency.gov.uk/fish) or by dialling 0844 800 5386. An Environment Agency spokesperson: ‘We are aware of on line third party providers who offer to buy the rod licence for you. They charge up to £20 for this service and do not purchase the licence on your behalf immediately. You could unwittingly go fishing without a licence, be liable for prosecution and pay £47 for a £27 licence’."
/government/news/norfolk-coastal-walks-benefit-from-seawall-repairs,"Popular coastal footpaths in north Norfolk made unsafe by the tidal surge are being re-opened. Norfolk coastal walks benefit from seawall repairs  Environment Agency The flood defence banks between Blakeney and Cley, and between Brancaster village and Brancaster beach suffered multiple breaches during the tidal surge in December. The damage was so significant that the footpaths on top of the defences had been closed since the surge. The Environment Agency is working with the National Trail, National Trust and Norfolk Trails to carry out the interim repairs which will allow the footpaths to be re-opened in time for the main tourism season. Mark Johnson, Coastal Manager at the Environment Agency, said: We’ve been talking to people and understand how important these footpaths are both to local people and the local economy. Although a decision about the longer term future of the defences in both locations is still subject to further discussion, we are keen to open the footpaths to allow safe pedestrian access whilst these discussions continue. The work in Blakeney has already started and is expected to be finished in time for the Easter bank holiday weekend. In Brancaster work started (7 April) and will take about six weeks. Patrick Saunders from the National Trail and Norfolk Trails said: We are fully aware of the Norfolk Coast Path popularity and of the local economic benefit provided by the National Trail as a whole. For this reason we are proud to be working together with the Environment Agency and other organisations to establish intermediate access in time for the Easter and summer seasons. Iain Wolfe, Visitor Services Manager for the National Trust North Norfolk Coast said: We are pleased that work to repair the paths is underway, whilst longer term plans for this part of the coastline continue to be developed. We are especially pleased that the paths will be completed in time for the busy Easter weekend. Easter traditionally marks the start of the tourist season and it is important to know that visitors will be able to experience this beautiful part of Norfolk. In Brancaster the repairs will allow safe pedestrian access between the village and the beach during high tides, and in Blakeney the work will mean that people have safe access around the Blakeney Freshes nature reserve."

/government/news/north-east-anglers-warned-to-obey-the-law,"Eleven people caught illegal fishing in a month North east anglers warned to obey the law Fisheries and rod licensing Environment Agency Anglers in Northumberland, Durham and Teesside are being reminded that the coarse fish close season is in operation, as enforcement officers cast their net on illegal fishing. Since the close season began on 16 March, Environment Agency fisheries enforcement officers have caught 11 people breaking the law. This seasonal blitz on illegal fishing will be stepped up over the coming Bank Holiday weekends, covering commercial and non-commercial waters, to ensure that anglers have a valid licence and are compliant with national and local bye laws. The maximum fine for fishing during the close season is £50,000; anyone caught doing so may be prosecuted. Kevin Summerson, special enforcement team leader at the Environment Agency, said: This is an important period for us. The close season in our rivers is important to allow the fish time to breed and spawn and so maintain a healthy stock of fish. We use intelligence gathered previously to indicate the locations where anglers are likely to be fishing illegally, and we concentrated our efforts towards those areas. This allows us to free up resources to carry out further work with partners at fisheries so we can carry out more checks than would normally be possible. All the money from rod licences goes straight back into trout and freshwater fisheries. People who fish without a rod licence are having a direct effect on the work we can deliver. Anglers caught fishing without a rod licence face a maximum fine of £2,500, and bye-law offences now carry a maximum fine of £50,000. We shall continue to target those waters where evasion and illegal activity is high and look to expanding our partnership working to deliver more for the environment. Anyone who suspects illegal fishing to be taking place should report the matter to the Environment Agency’s incident hotline, on 0800 807060."

/government/news/two-county-durham-anglers-banned-for-illegal-fishing-methods,"Men sentenced for offences by Peterlee Magistrates Two County Durham anglers banned for illegal fishing methods Fisheries and rod licensing Environment Agency Two County Durham anglers have been banned from holding a rod licence for 12 months after being caught using illegal fishing methods. Dean Heseltine, 32, of Braunespath Estate, New Brancepeth, Durham, and Michael Scotter, 28, of Byer Street, Hetton-le-Hole, Houghton-le-Spring, also had their equipment forfeited following an Environment Agency enforcement operation last year. The two men were sentenced yesterday (15 April) at Peterlee Magistrates’ Court, where they both admitted a charge of using a banned fishing method, known as ‘stroke hauling’, in the River Wear at Framwellgate, Durham, one night in September. In addition, Heseltine admitted a charge of resisting a fisheries enforcement officer, after he tried to avoid being caught by hiding in some waterside bushes before attempting to escape up the riverbank. Stroke hauling, or snatching, is a technique where the hook impales the fish about its body or head rather than the fish taking the hook in its mouth out of choice. Not only is this an illegal method, but fish that are caught in this way can sometimes break free from the hook or snap the line and become susceptible to disease and may die before reaching the spawning grounds. Having seen the defendants stroke hauling in the water, the enforcement officers found nearby some bags, containing seven salmon and one sea trout. Kevin Summerson, fisheries enforcement team leader at the Environment Agency, said: We shall continue to police this area for as long as is necessary to bring a halt to this illegal activity. Members of the public need to be aware that these poachers are not taking ‘one for the pot’, they are taking frequently high numbers of fish that are often sold on for monetary gain. It is not a victimless crime: the methods that are being used can have a dramatic impact on wildlife, cause serious damage to already threatened fish stocks, our natural heritage, and ruin the sport for legitimate anglers and future generations. If anyone has any information in relation to where these fish are being sold I would be pleased to listen to them. Information can be provided anonymously and any information received is treated in the strictest confidence. The court handed each defendant a 12-month conditional discharge, and ordered that they each pay £250 legal costs and a victim surcharge of £15. If anyone thinks they have seen any illegal fishing, they should phone the Environment Agency’s 24-hour incident hotline on 0800 807060 or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111."
/government/news/rod-licence-money-improves-great-ouse,"A section of bank on the Great Ouse at Stony Stratford has been repaired using money from rod licence sales Rod licence money improves Great Ouse  Environment Agency The bank had worn as a result of livestock and flow pressures from Stony Sluice. It has now been reinforced and protected using willow bundles. The work has provided an instant habitat and as the ‘live’ willow grows it will further stabilise the bank preventing further erosion and the build up of silt. The Environment Agency’s Ian Hirst, Fisheries and Biodiversity Team Leader for Cambridgeshire and Bedfordshire, said: Buying a rod licence supports our work to improve fishing and help improve rivers. Without this funding we would not be able to monitor our fish populations and make the right investments to improve the water environment. His team worked with Milton Keynes’ Parks Trust and volunteers to repair the section of eroded bank on the Great Ouse at Stony Stratford. Milton Keynes’ Parks Trust and their volunteers will look for other opportunities to apply their newly acquired skills and help make improvements to the river habitats in Milton Keynes over the next few years. Rod licence funds also enable the Environment Agency to carry out routine monitoring of fish populations using electrofishing and netting. This information provides a good indication of the health of a river. The team also monitors fish passes and habitat improvements to assess their efficiency and understand how successful they have been in helping migratory fish. Funds also support a 24/7 emergency response service; meaning Environment Agency staff are on hand should the lives of fish be threatened as a result of low oxygen levels or pollution. All anglers need a valid licence to fish legally and by buying they also contribute to work to keep the environment in good shape. Fines for not holding a licence can be as high as £2,500. Licences can be bought using a credit or debit card by calling the telesales line on 0844 800 5386. Alternatively visit any Post Office or click here ."
/government/news/chesterfield-scrap-metal-firm-fined-16000-for-illegal-fires,"Richard Fletcher (Metals) Ltd sentenced by North East Derbyshire & Dales Magistrates Chesterfield scrap metal firm fined £16,000 for illegal fires  Environment Agency A Chesterfield skip hire and scrap metal firm has been fined £16,000 for illegally disposing of waste by burning it. Richard Fletcher (Metals) Ltd, based at Newbridge Lane, Old Whittington, Chesterfield, was sentenced by North East Derbyshire & Dales Magistrates on 16 April following an Environment Agency investigation. It was on Bonfire Night last year that the Derbyshire Fire and Rescue Service was called out to a large fire on the company’s premises. The company had contacted the fire service earlier that day to inform them that a small, controlled fire had been started, but it was claimed that this had got out of control. By the evening, the blaze was emitting a lot of dark smoke, which was heading south west in the direction of Chesterfield town centre. It took fire fighters 90 minutes to bring the fire under control. The next day, on 6 November, the Environment Agency received a call from Chesterfield Council’s environmental health team, who reported that coach seats, rubber, metal, and vinyl were being burned on the site. The fire was indeed still burning, and the fire brigade went back to Richard Fletcher’s when it received a report that a bus was on fire. Fire fighters spent two-and-a-half hours putting out the fire and dampening down the remains. Nadine Sime, prosecuting for the Environment Agency, told the court that investigating officers inspected the smouldering remains and found several types of burnt waste, including soil, metal, plastic, rubber, cardboard, rubble, and foam chairs. At the side of the fire were three burnt-out coaches, several piles of burnt metal, and tyres. The smoke caused the investigating officer’s eyes to sting, and for up to an hour after leaving the site she felt nauseous. Another visit on 8 November revealed that another fire had been started, this time in a 200-litre drum that was being used to burn paper and general rubbish. In court, the firm admitted one charge of disposing of waste in a manner likely to cause pollution or harm to human health Representing the company, firm director Richard Fletcher said in mitigation that the waste had been burned by staff who did not know that doing so was against the law. Fran Lowe, Environment Manager at the Environment Agency, said: “Uncontrolled burning of waste is a serious offence, posing significant risks to human health and the environment. In addition, fire service attendance to control such fires represents a considerable cost to the public purse. We will not tolerate waste crime of this nature and will not hesitate to take enforcement action where necessary. It is pleasing to see that the courts mirror our view on the severity of this incident.” In addition to the fine, the company was ordered to pay £3,097.73 in costs and a victim surcharge of £120."

Spot checks were carried out on all of the north east’s major rivers and most large stillwaters over four days, ensuring that anglers were properly licensed and following seasonal rules. Some 1,064 anglers were checked: 27 were fishing without a licence, and seven close season bye-law offences were detected. This weekend’s operation follows similar enforcement action that saw 11 anglers caught fishing illegally in the first three weeks of the close season, which began on 16 March. Kevin Summerson, fisheries enforcement team leader at the Environment Agency, said: This weekend we were targeting anglers who persist in using illegal baits in rivers during the close season. The close season in our rivers is important to allow migratory fish time to breed and spawn, and certain baits that are more attractive to coarse fish are banned at this time to reduce the opportunity of game anglers inadvertently catching freshwater fish. We also checked anglers at stillwaters and reservoirs to ensure they were fishing with a valid licence. This is important because the revenue from licence fees goes back into improving fisheries, be that water quality, habitat or compliance. Anyone who suspects illegal fishing to be taking place should report the matter to the Environment Agency’s incident hotline, on 0800 807060."

/government/news/northumbrian-water-ltd-fined-30000-over-pollution-incidents,"Company in court over two separate offences Northumbrian Water Ltd fined £30,000 over pollution incidents  Environment Agency Northumbrian Water Ltd has been fined a total of £30,000 for two sewage pollution incidents that happened last year. In two separate cases that were both heard before Peterlee Magistrates’ Court on 22 April, the water company admitted and was sentenced for two offences of discharging polluted matter into watercourses. Chris Bunting, prosecuting for the Environment Agency, told the court that the first pollution incident affected Kyo Burn, the source of the River Team, situated to the south west of Stanley, in June. The watercourse was running an unusual grey colour and smelt of blocked drains, and an ecological survey found sewage fungus and dead invertebrates along a 1.8 kilometre stretch of the watercourse. Investigating officers found that the burn had been affected by sewage discharge from a storm overflow on the Tanfield Trunk Sewer. In normal circumstances, the storm overflow only allows a discharge in times of heavy rain, to alleviate flood risk. But the overflow had operated incorrectly because of a blockage, and the company had not been aware because its monitoring equipment on the sewer was not working correctly. The second pollution incident occurred in August in Bowburn Beck, which flows into the River Wear south of Durham City. This watercourse had been affected with sewage when a blockage in a sewer had caused a manhole cover to lift, allowing sewage to flow out, across a farmland and into the beck. Northumbrian Water was informed about the problem, but failed to investigate the issue for four days. It claimed that it had difficulty accessing the site because of the presence of dogs on the farm, although alternative access routes could have been considered. The firm eventually found that the blockage had been caused by rags, oil, fat and grease. Water samples and an ecological survey showed that a one-kilometre stretch of Bowburn Beck had been significantly affected. There were high numbers of dead and dying invertebrates, with a small number of dead fish. There was also a thick sewage fungus present. Northumbrian Water Ltd admitted one offence for each of the pollution incidents. For the Kyo Burn offence, the company was fined £14,000 and ordered to pay £3,996.04 costs and a £120 victim surcharge. For the Bowburn Beck offence, the firm was fined £16,000 and ordered to pay £4,772.52 costs. Graham Siddle, Environment Management Team Leader at the Environment Agency, said: In both of these incidents, the sewage had a detrimental effect on the natural environment. That’s why it is vital that water companies and other industries ensure they work within the rules and meet all conditions of their environmental permits. Where possible, the Environment Agency works with companies to help them meet their environmental obligations, but where significant breaches are seen, enforcement action will be taken."
/government/news/composting-company-fined-for-causing-offensive-odours,"A Dorset composting business has been ordered to pay £13,500 in fines and costs for breaching its environmental permit and causing offensive odours.  Composting company fined for causing offensive odours  Environment Agency The Environment Agency has received numerous complaints about the composting activities of Eco Sustainable Solutions Ltd since 2006. The company, that is located close to houses, local business parks and Bournemouth Airport, is able to process 180,000 tonnes of material a year of which 45,000 is food waste and 35,000 tonnes, green waste. The site also has a permit to process soils and wood. Despite being issued with various warning letters, Eco Sustainable Solutions failed to address the problem and in March 2011 the company accepted a formal caution from the Agency for breaching the odour condition of its permit. The odour complaints continued into 2013 when they increased in number of frequency. In October 2013 the Agency’s national odour expert visited the composting site and recommended a number of improvements. Eco Sustainable Solutions was subsequently served with four enforcement notices since in a bid to ensure future compliance with its permit. The four notices required the company to move from a block to an open windrow system for both their green and in-vessel composting, improve the aeration of the site’s leachate lagoons, improve the company’s food reception building and produce a new environmental management system and odour management plan. Stephanie Marriott for the Environment Agency said: > The good news is the operator has now complied with three of the notices and is on course to comply with the fourth very soon. Since December 2013 they have worked closely with us and made significant on-site improvements. They have stopped their in-vessel composting activities. Appearing before Bournemouth magistrates, Eco Sustainable Solutions Ltd (ESS), of Chapel Lane, Parley, Christchurch was fined a total of £7,400 and ordered to pay £6,100 costs after pleading guilty to four offences of contravening permit conditions between October 2012 and June 2013 and five offences of causing significant odour off site between February and April 2013. The company was prosecuted under the Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2010. The case was heard last Wednesday (April 16). - Ends -"

/government/news/fly-tipping-hot-spot-gets-spring-clean--2,"The Environment Agency, Stockton Borough Council and local social enterprise are teaming up to clean local stream  Fly tipping hot spot gets spring clean  Environment Agency The Environment Agency, The Skill Mill and Stockton Borough Council are teaming up this year to support the spring by organising a clean-up of Lustrum Beck in Stockton on Tees. Following the success of previous clean-ups in other areas the teams are joining forces, this time in Stockton-On-Tees, to clear debris such as shopping trolleys, traffic cones, tyres and other fly-tipped items with the aim to reduce the risk of flooding and improve the appearance of the area. The Skill Mill, based in Newcastle is a social enterprise which specialises in flood risk management through water course maintenance and other environmental improvements. The Skill Mill provides employment with training for you people ages 16-18 and works throughout the North East of England. David Parks, Director of the Skill Mill said: Encouraging organisations and people to collaborate on community projects are the most sustainable way of engaging the community in the importance of keeping areas cleans and waterways free of debris that can contribute to flooding. Involving local young people in the clean up provides an example to the community and hopefully encourages people everyone to consider the very damaging impact of littering and fly tipping on the environment. The Environment Agency has an annual maintenance programme to clear obstructions from rivers that might cause a flood risk. The councils will help to collect any debris and litter and take it away for safe disposal or to be recycled. Andrew Foster in the Environment Agency’s Field Operations team said: The Environment Agency normally only removes debris that could cause an obstruction, and a flood risk. So this is another great opportunity to pool resources with the councils to clear all litter and debris we find in the rivers and have a thorough spring clean. Our teams are trained to work in deep water, using specialised equipment and protective suits to remove debris from the river. Last year we had a few surprises, especially when we pulled an old dentist’s chair out of the river. We also collected up to 30 tyres from the river in Darlington. Fly-tipped rubbish is not only unsightly, but could increase the risk of flooding in bad weather if it gets washed further downstream."

/government/news/scrap-operator-fined-7000,"An operator of a waste vehicle dismantling site in Norfolk has been fined £7,000 by King's Lynn Magistrates' Court. Scrap operator fined £7,000  Environment Agency The operator of a waste vehicle dismantling site at Dereham, Norfolk repeatedly ignored Environment Agency advice not to store waste vehicles and parts in a field, and today (Thurs) was fined £7,000 by King’s Lynn Magistrates’ Court. He was also ordered to pay £4,033 costs. Colin Barnes of Podmore Lane, Scarning, Dereham, used the field next to his site as an overflow facility for his scrap business, but the field did not have any hard standing or drainage to prevent leaks from vehicles polluting the environment and it was not authorised to store waste. Environment officers visited Barnes on 15 occasions over 23 months and issued him with an enforcement notice to clear the field. He failed to comply. Environment Agency prosecutor, Mrs Miriam Tordoff, told the court that : “The waste activities were deliberate. Colin Barnes was aware of the need to be appropriately authorised to manage waste as he holds a waste permit for adjacent land and had numerous visits from Environment Agency officers.” Barnes told investigating officers that he had been trying his best to clear the field. Some of the waste was moved there from his permitted site while he carried out concreting work. He did not think any of the vehicles would leak. The field was cleared by February 2014. After the hearing Environment Agency officer Simon Engler said: “This case highlights the importance of ensuring the appropriate permits or authorisations are in place for waste businesses.” “As well as saving the cost of obtaining a permit, this operator avoided the cost of installing proper infrastructure designed to prevent pollution. This sort of activity undercuts legitimate businesses and puts the environment at risk.” Barnes pleaded guilty to: Between 04 December 2011 and 19 November 2013 on land at Willow Lodge, Podmore Lane, Scarning, Dereham, Norfolk NR19 2NS you did operate a regulated facility, namely a waste operation for the storage of waste motor vehicles and vehicle parts, without being authorised by an environmental permit granted under Regulation 13 of the Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2010. Contrary to Regulation 12(1)(a) and 38(1)(a) Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2010 Fined £5,000 You failed, without reasonable excuse, by 12 noon on 02 August 2013 to comply with the requirement in a notice dated 03 July 2013 and served on you pursuant to section 59 (1)(a) of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 to remove controlled waste from land occupied by you at Willow Lodge, Podmore Lane, Scarning, Dereham, Norfolk NR19 2NS.

Colne Barrier gets major refurbishment  Environment Agency The Colne Barrier, which reduces the risk of tidal flooding to more than 2,000 homes and businesses in the Wivenhoe and Colchester areas, will get some important maintenance during May and June this year. Stuart Barbrook, Environment Agency Project Manager said: The Colne Barrier is an important piece of infrastructure that provides vital protection from flood risk to homes and businesses in this area. The work we are doing will make sure that it continues to do this for many years to come. The barrier was built in 1992 and was designed to last for 50 years with the exception of the mechanical and electrical components which have a shorter life of around 20 years. It is operated a number of times each year and is an important part of the defences that protect Essex from tidal flooding. The barrier’s worth was particularly demonstrated during the December 2013 tidal surge, the worst tidal surge to hit the East Coast for 60 years. Work begins on 6 May and runs into June. Both gates will be lifted and refurbished on site. This may mean some disruption to local people.

/government/publications/humber-flood-risk-management-strategy,"How the Environment Agency is reducing flood risk in the Humber Estuary. Humber flood risk management strategy  Environment Agency Nearly 400,000 people live or work on low-lying land around the Humber Estuary so it is one of the many places that will be affected by rising sea levels. And with current predictions showing sea level rise of up to 0.35 metres by 2060 and up to a metre by 2110 we need to consider long-term protection of communities and habitats in this area. This strategy outlines flood risk management plan for the Humber Estuary for the next 25 years and beyond. It looks at different ways of managing flood risk; raising defences where appropriate, but also introducing sites for managed realignment and flood storage which will help maintain valuable habitats. It aims to ensure a good standard of protection from tidal flooding for the next 25 years and beyond for 99% of residents round the estuary and the important industrial areas. However, there are difficult decisions to make. Funds are limited, so the Environment Agency will not be able to improve all of the estuary’s defences. The documents identify those areas that could be affected and answer some of the questions that you may ask."

The sluice gate helps to prevent flooding in the area by reducing river levels upstream when the river is high and is an important element of the area’s flood defences. The facility also includes a popular canoe slalom course that is used throughout the year recreationally by local residents and clubs. Chris Collin, Environment Agency officer, said: This work is essential in maintaining a high level of flood protection to the Cardington area, and will have the added benefit of improving the canoeing course at the same time. We aim to cause as little disruption as possible while we complete this work. The extensive maintenance work will include fencing off the working and compound areas next to the sluice.

Taking the Exe Estuary into the classroom  Environment Agency The free teacher training day has been developed and paid for by the Living with a Changing Coast (LiCCo) project, with the involvement of the Environment Agency, the Exe Estuary Management Partnership, the National Trust and the former Devon County Council schools geography advisor. The storms of this winter highlighted the scale of damage and disruption that can be wreaked on the coastline by nature. While it was not the first time that the Dawlish railway line was severed (it breached in 1846, 1855 and 1869) scientists predict that climate change will bring more frequent and intense storms as atmosphere warms up and is able to hold more energy. It has been decided that needs to be done to make coastal communities more aware of how the coast changes naturally and how tidal flood risk may increase as a result of climate change and sea level rise. By increasing understanding of these issues amongst 7-16 year olds it can help to ensure that the next generation becomes more resilient and better able to cope with extreme weather. The new schools resources use photos, presentations, film clips, data, old photos and even action songs to provide an inspiring way of learning what makes the Exe Estuary special. Lesson plans cover the complex natural processes at work, the different habitats found here, why people visit, how flooding is managed and how the coast has changed over time. Courtlands is also hosting another primary teacher training day on 6 June and a secondary teacher training day on 26 June. Resources are also being developed for GCSE level. The response so far has been staggering with 170 teachers already registered to attend from Devon and Dorset.

/government/news/severn-trent-fined-over-pollution-of-the-messingham-reservoir,"On 14 May 2014, Severn Trent Water Limited pleaded guilty at Scunthorpe Magistrates’ Court to  polluting the Messingham Reservoir, a local fishing pond near Carcar Farm in North Lincolnshire with untreated sewage which led to a significant fish kill.  Severn Trent fined over pollution of the Messingham Reservoir  Environment Agency The company was fined £25,000 and ordered to pay £10,267.05 in costs, along with a £15 victim surcharge. The charges were brought by the Environment Agency under Regulation 38(1)(a) and Regulation 12(1)(b) of the Environmental Permitting Regulations 2010. On 20 August 2012 the Environment Agency received a report from Severn Trent Water Limited that sewage was discharging from a blocked manhole in a field of wheat east of Carcar Farm. The sewage then flowed over the field into a ditch known as the Gelder Beck, then into the Catchwater Drain, consequently entering Messingham Reservoir via an overflow pipe. The Messingham Reservoir is a 35-year-old pond stocked with a variety of fish including perch, carp and pike. Environment Agency officers who attended the site – situated between North Moor Road and the A159 - on 20 August 2012 noticed a raised manhole cover that was discharging liquid from around the side of the cover. The discharge was entering the watercourse in a number of places by over-tipping the bank. Our officers noted a land drain pipe discharging liquid into the watercourse, as well as witnessing some of the fish which had died. An investigation carried out by the Environment Agency into the incident identified that over 2000 metres of watercourse were contaminated with sewage. Speaking after the case, an Environment Agency officer in charge of the investigation said: “We take cases of pollution to watercourses seriously due to the environmental damage that can be caused. In this case, Severn Trent Water fell short of their responsibilities to maintain the sewer which led to the blockage, and so we did not hesitate to prosecute.” In mitigation, the court was told that the company pleaded guilty at the first opportunity and fully cooperated with the Environment Agency’s investigation. In addition, they took significant action after the pollution incident and made a number of improvements following this event."

Painting the town yellow in Teignmouth  Environment Agency On Tuesday, they will launch an educational campaign designed by the Environment Agency called ‘Yellow Fish’. The campaign involves painting yellow fish next to the drains that connect to the surface water pipes that lead to the estuary or the sea. By marking the drains, and explaining where surface water ends up, it will show business owners and the public how pollution travels direct to the sea. The Agency hopes that this will help to keep the local beach cleaner. The team will locate the road drains around the town and paint yellow fish on the drain covers or kerb stones. They will also ask businesses in the community to pledge not to pour anything down the road drain and it is hoped they will display a yellow fish poster to show that they support the campaign. Nick Smart for the Environment Agency said: It has been great having the opportunity to work with local people, who also use and enjoy the local bathing beaches. By delivering this campaign we hope to show everyone the link between preventing pollution in the town and protecting our bathing waters. Cllr Kevin Lake, Executive Portfolio Holder for Environmental Services at Teignbridge District Council said: The campaign will hopefully encourage people to stop pouring fat and other pollutants into the drain system and this will help to improve bathing water quality in the town. It will also show local business owners and people living in the town that some of the drains on the street lead direct to Teignmouth’s bathing waters. Other things people can do to help their bathing water are: • Pick up your dog mess from the beach, and also the roads and pavements where it can get into the drains • Put food waste securely in the bin to discourage scavenging birds from the beach and town area. • Dispose of all wastes sensibly. • Place waste sanitary products in the bin not down the loo where they can cause blockages and sewage flooding. • Check that your drains are connected properly.

Environment Agency and Sedgemoor District Council set-up Bridgwater barrier workshop  Environment Agency The purpose of the workshop, organised by the Environment Agency and Sedgemoor District Council, will be to update partners of the flood risk in the catchment, outline the options for mitigating it and clarify what each option may or may not be able to achieve. It has been identified that a barrier to the River Parrett is needed to address the impact of sea level rise and protect the town from flooding. A key action of the Somerset Levels and Moors 20 year Flood Action Plan is to reduce the duration and frequency of flooding and to review design options for the Bridgwater barrier. The first stage of this action is to stage a technical workshop for an invited audience. The Agency, Sedgemoor District Council and Somerset County Council have come together to develop and deliver the Bridgwater Challenge, a strategy and vision for the regeneration of Bridgwater. After the workshop, the Environment Agency will be joining with Sedgemoor District Council to update the current report, which will help inform the decision on the best option for Bridgwater and the surrounding area. John Buttivant for the Environment Agency said: We are currently building a detailed model which looks at the water flowing into and out of the rivers systems across the Somerset Levels and Moors. The modelling will provide evidence to understand the wider benefits of a River Parrett barrier,’ ‘This work will allow an informed decision on the preferred solution. A tidal surge barrier would protect the tidal Parrett and Tone upstream of Bridgwater from the effects of extreme high tide and surges. It is estimated that it will be three to five years before construction starts and is likely to take a further 3-5 years to complete. There are currently two main options to the type of barrier that may be possible in Bridgwater: • Penning structures, which act as a barrier to prevent salt water from the estuary entering the River Parrett. This would maintain a more constant fresh water level upstream of the barrier and exclude downstream tidal inundation and saline intrusion. • Storm surge barriers or tidal barriers which are structures that are closed when an extreme water level or tide is forecast, in order to prevent flooding from the sea, in settlements up river. River flow coming down the catchment would be stored upstream of the barrier while it is closed. When the tide falls and the barrier reopens, the fresh river water flows out. Ends"

It’s reely time to get the rods out and #gofishing  Environment Agency Why not take a mate for free #gofishing Anglers old and new are being urged to buy a rod licence for the start of the new river fishing season and discover some excellent fishing opportunities they never knew existed in the east of England. The campaign has been organised and run by the Angling Trades Association with the Environment Agency and Angling Trust. To take part, print the rod licence voucher, fill in the person’s details, validate it online at (http://www.takeafriendfishing.co.uk/offers/free-rod-licence-voucher/) and read the terms and conditions. Pictures from the day, including venue name, catch details, captor’s name and daytime telephone number, can be sent to info@takeafriendfishing.co.uk. It costs anglers just £27 (fixed at the 2011 price) for a full annual licence and the money goes towards Environment Agency projects for the area’s vast range of lowland rivers, chalk streams and man-made drains. Roger Handford, an Environment Agency fisheries specialist said: “We are blessed with exceptional fisheries of national renown in this part of the country. “The chance of encountering a fish of a lifetime is a significant attraction to anglers who should now be buying a licence to try their luck and skills on local riverbanks as the new season approaches. “We want to improve fish stocks and provide a better environment for wildlife and people. We want to make it possible for more people of all abilities to enjoy angling and for our fisheries to provide a positive contribution to the quality of people’s lives.” Rivers in the area offer barbel in the Wensum, zander in the Fens, pike in the Broads, and large perch in the Great Ouse. A variety of stillwaters are also home to carp, bream and tench, while the trout fishing at Rutland, Grafham and other similar reservoirs is also widely praised. There are over 6,000 fisheries listed on the Environment Agency online database to find a location close to you - (www.fishinginfo.co.uk) Examples of where the rod licence money goes Buckinghamshire On the Great Ouse at Stony Stratford a section of eroded bank was repaired. The bank had worn as a result of livestock along with flow pressures from Stony Sluice. Working with Milton Keynes’ Parks Trust and volunteers it has now been reinforced and protected using willow bundles, a soft engineering solution. The work has provided an instant habitat that was previously missing and as the ‘live’ willow grows it will further stabilize the bank preventing further erosion, build up of silt and degradation of river habitats. Cambridgeshire Trees have been planted along the Houghton Trout Stream in Cambridgeshire. Working with land owners and angling clubs, Environment Agency staff helped plant more than 100 willow whips to improve natural habitats and biodiversity within the river. The trees will help to provide cover and shelter for fish. They will also provide a future source of woody material to the channel which will in turn help to create and sustain good quality habitats. Norfolk A restoration project at Heacham Lavender Mill, Norfolk. Environment Agency fisheries and biodiversity team members completed 300 meters of habitat improvement to transform a silty, straightened and over-grazed section of river with re-sculpted banks to create a floodplain-type habitat. The site will provide a more varied and valuable habitat for fish and invertebrates while preventing erosion. The team worked with staff and volunteers from Norfolk Rivers Trust on the two-day project. They planted 2500 plugs of native English chalk-stream plants including purple loosestrife, meadowsweet, marsh marigold, lesser pond sedge and fleabane along the bank. The plants will take hold over the next few months and provide a colourful environment as well as great habitat for insects and possibly water voles. Owners and staff of the Lavender Mill helped by replacing old fencing and planting trees along the new banks. The river will now be made accessible to all visitors and be complemented by an extended nature walk opening up acres of previously ignored land. Funds also support a 24/7 emergency response service; meaning Environment Agency staff are on hand should the lives of fish be threatened as a result of low oxygen levels or pollution."

/government/news/waste-men-merry-dance-into-crown-court,"Two Luton men who operated a waste site without an environmental permit have been sentenced to 6 months in prison, suspended for a year. Waste men ‘merry dance’ into crown court  Environment Agency Skip hire operators guilty of running illegal Bedfordshire site Both men pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing to operating a skip hire business trading as McGowan’s Skip Hire at Gravenhurst Road, Silsoe, Bedfordshire. Yesterday (10 Jun) Mark Christopher Blench, aged 42, of Hollybush Road was also fined £3,000 and ordered to pay a contribution of £5,000 towards prosecution costs. Kevin Peter McWilliams, aged 32, of Cornel Close was also ordered to carry out 180 hours unpaid work. Mrs Anne-Lise McDonald, prosecuting for the Environment Agency at Luton Crown Court said Blench brought back large quantities of waste and deposited and sorted it at the site but was only authorised to transport waste. McWilliams moved waste on the site and sorted and disposed of waste by burning. On 6 May 2014, they pleaded guilty at Luton Crown Court and were convicted of 1 offence of carrying out waste operations without the required environmental permit between 17 September 2012 and 4 April 2013. Mr Ged Colbon for Blench said he was ‘out of his depth’ and what he did was ‘not sophisticated’. Ms Minal Raj for McWilliams said he was regretful of his conduct and showed remorse. After the hearing Environment Agency officer Sarah Melvin said: Our specialist Environmental Crime Teams have the skills and determination to tackle serious criminals and ensure that waste crime doesn’t pay. We need to tackle waste crime to ensure a level playing field for legitimate business and to protect the environment. Judge Stuart Bridge said: The defendants led the officers a merry dance over six months. They ignored advice and gave false names making the officers’ tasks more difficult. They knew what they were doing was illegal and had a history of non-compliance with warnings. Blench gained financially. Pleas Blench pleaded guilty to: Between 17 September 2012 and 4 April 2013 on land at Gravenhurst Road, Silsoe, Bedfordshire, jointly with Kevin Peter McWilliams, you did operate a regulated facility, namely a waste operation for the deposit, storage, treatment and disposal of waste, without being authorised by an environmental permit granted under Regulation 13 of the Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2010. Contrary to Regulation 12(1)(a) and 38(1)(a) Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2010.

/government/news/enforcement-patrols-catch-illegal-anglers-in-the-north-east,"63 offences reported during the close season Enforcement patrols catch illegal anglers in the North East Fisheries and rod licensing Environment Agency Illegal anglers are being warned to obey the law or face prosecution after spot checks recorded 63 offences in the North East in the past three months. Enforcement patrols carried out during the coarse fish close season, which runs from 15 March to 15 June, reported 30 offences relating to fishing out of season, and another 33 offences that mostly involved fishing without a licence. In May, three people were prosecuted for illegal fishing in the North East. The average fine for those prosecuted was £229. Nationally, there were 128 prosecutions in May. One angler’s failure to obtain a valid licence landed him with a fine of £827, when a year-long licence would have cost him just £27. Kevin Summerson, special enforcement team leader at the Environment Agency, said: Generally speaking, anglers in the North East are compliant with the law, but we are still out there carrying out spot checks, and we do find people fishing illegally. These offences are committed by the angler not having a licence, or by them coarse fishing during the close season. Both of these types of offences are crimes, and those who are caught will face appropriate enforcement action: they could be fined or banned. The coarse fishing close season exists to allow the fish time to breed and spawn and so maintain a healthy stock of fish. When people ignore it, they are putting fish stocks at risk, which has a direct impact on the ecology of the watercourses and the enjoyment of other anglers. Legitimate anglers can be assured we shall continue our pro-active approach to licence checking through an intelligence-led, co-ordinated program in partnership with like-minded bodies so we can reduce illegal fishing activity. The high bankside evasion rate shows how effective targeted enforcement can be in delivering results. The new fishing season for rivers, streams and drains began on 16 June, and those who want to get involved in this fantastic sport can buy a rod licence from Post Officers, the Environment Agency’s website , or by calling 0844 800 5386. Licences cost £27 (fixed at the 2011 price) for a full annual licence and the money allows the Environment Agency to continue to manage and improve fisheries on rivers, streams and man-made drains. Anyone who suspects illegal fishing to be taking place should report the matter to the Environment Agency’s incident hotline, on 0800 807060."

/government/news/clapham-anaerobic-site-risked-pollution,"A spill at Biogen’s anaerobic digestion site in Bedfordshire resulted from the company not following its own procedures, a court heard.     Clapham anaerobic site risked pollution  Environment Agency Mrs Claire Corfield, prosecuting for the Environment Agency at Luton Magistrates’ Court, said there had been a series of errors on 11 June 2012. The company, which operates from Twinwoods Farm, Oakley Littlewood, Clapham, pleaded guilty to breaching its permit and was fined and ordered to pay costs totalling £8,700. The company asked for a second offence concerning failing to report the incident without delay to be taken into consideration by the court. Not checked Mrs Corfield told the court that on the day of the incident, electrical work was undertaken to the new separator situated between 2 digestate storage tanks. Following this work, a company operative turned an isolator switch back on re-starting the pumped transfer of digestate between the tanks. The site manager was unaware of this and forgot to do his close down checks at the end of the day. Later investigations showed the company had failed to follow a number of its procedures which meant the necessary risk assessments were not carried out before electrical work was done to the new separator. In addition there was no written procedure for the transfer of digestate between storage tanks, there was no system of planned preventative maintenance and visual checks of underground pipes were sporadic and not recorded. Before the incident, the company had identified various pollution risks at the site, yet had failed to adequately address them. Two spills The result was 2 separate spills which were spotted on CCTV by the head of plant operations, who was monitoring the site from home and alerted the site manager. The site manager went to the site and reported back that a storage tank was overfilled and about 350 cubic metres of digestate (a nutrient-rich substance produced by anaerobic digestion that can be used as a fertiliser) had overflowed onto the ground and there was a separate spill of 20 cubic metres of raw waste. It appeared that the spills had been contained on site by the bund. No alarms had been triggered. Biogen’s permit authorises the acceptance and treatment of 47,500 tonnes of combined food waste and pig slurry per year. It also requires a written management system to identify and minimise risks of pollution. Dam Mrs Corfield said that Environment Agency officers were alerted to the site the following day by a complaint of bad smells from a member of the public and found a large amount of digestate covering the base of the compound. A surface water outfall pipe, from the site and neighbouring pig unit, was discharging a black effluent into the adjacent ditch which smelt of digestate. Downstream a dam had been built and the ditch was being cleaned up. Fifteen hours after the spills were discovered, the company reported the incident to the Agency. Previous conviction A company representative told investigating officers that an underground pipe had fractured resulting in the spill of raw waste and that a transfer pump between 2 storage tanks had been left running unattended. He said they had notified the Agency as soon as they realised there might be a link between the spill and the levels of ammonia in the outfall pipe. The company has a previous conviction for a pollution at the same site on 19 November 2010 which involved the spill of 300 cubic metres of digestate. There was a similar incident at another anaerobic digester plant at Westwood in September 2010 when an alarm failed and 1 tonne of digestate had gone into a ditch. Digestate has the potential to harm the environment if it gets into watercourses. Digestate from anaerobic digestion of food waste and slurry is likely to contain grossly polluting levels of biochemical oxygen demand and ammonia. After the hearing, Environment Agency officer Rob Jamieson said: “This case demonstrates the potential for adverse environmental impact resulting from an inadequate environmental management system and the failure to apply the controls within the management system fully.” Charges Biogen pleaded guilty to: On or about 11 June 2012 you, being the operator of an Environmental Permit reference EPR/KP3496NT (as varied), for a regulated facility at Twinwoods Farm, Oakley Littlewood, Clapham, Bedfordshire MK41 6BL, failed to comply with Condition 1.1.1(a) of the said Permit in that you failed to manage and operate the activities: In accordance with a written management system that identifies and minimises risks of pollution. (Contrary to Regulation 38(2) Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2010). Biogen asked for the following offence to be taken into consideration: On or about 11 June 2012 you, being the operator of an Environmental Permit reference EPR/KP3496NT (as varied), for a regulated facility at Twinwoods Farm, Oakley Littlewood, Clapham, Bedfordshire MK41 6BL, failed to comply with Condition 4.3.1(a) of the said Permit in that you failed to notify the Agency without delay following the detection of any malfunction, breakdown or failure of equipment or techniques, accident or emission of a substance not controlled by an emission limit which has caused, is causing or may cause significant pollution.

/government/news/schools-environmental-project-starts-with-raingardens,"On 20 June, St Peter’s RC High School, working with the Environment Agency and Gloucester City Council, officially opened three raingardens. School’s environmental project starts with raingardens  Environment Agency The raingardens will help improve the environment in the local brook and the school, and contribute to managing flood risk. Local MP, Richard Graham conducted the official opening, which marks the start of participation in a school-wide Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS) scheme. The first phase of the scheme, funded by the Environment Agency and designed by local firm Robert Bray Associates, will help to re-naturalise flows in the Whaddon brook and improve the environment in the school and the brook as part of the Gloucestershire Green Urban Rivers Project. Raingardens are one of a range of techniques that can be used to reduce and slow down the volume of rainwater running off hard, or impermeable, areas into drains. An Environment Agency spokesperson said: “Raingardens like these could help improve water quality and reduce flood risk all over Gloucester if they are included in new and existing developments.” Steve Lester, Business Manager at St Peter’s said: “We now have three beautifully designed raingardens for our students to enjoy that also has a functional purpose. The school’s Eco-Club students have been involved throughout the project planning and have helped with all the planting. The raingardens are a great resource for many areas including geography, science, maths, art and design technology. They are a super addition to the school and we are very grateful to the Environment Agency and Gloucester City for their support.” Richard Graham, MP for Gloucester said: “What I’ve seen at St Peters will change how the school handles water run-off from Robinswood Hill and from classroom roofs. The three rain ponds and the school Eco Club that maintain them will absorb water and prevent flooding on the Whaddon Brook. And the idea can be replicated at other schools across the city, making a real difference to flood defences. It’s about partnership - with both the EA and the city council playing a key part."

/government/news/rod-licence-cheats-blitzed-by-environment-agency,"Environment Agency enforcement teams carried out more than 13,000 rod licence checks across England in May.    Rod licence cheats blitzed by Environment Agency Fisheries and rod licensing Environment Agency Of the anglers checked for a valid licence, 965 were fishing illegally and could face a court appearance and a substantial fine. A recent penalty was more than £800, when an annual licence costs just £27. May falls within the coarse fishing ‘close season’ – which runs from 15 March to 15 June – when coarse angling is suspended on rivers and a few canals and lakes in order to allow coarse fish to breed. While some licence cheats were also fishing rivers during the close season, the majority were caught on stillwaters where fishing is still allowed during these months. One Environment Agency enforcement officer reported an angler for fishing with three rods on one licence (each licence covers up to two rods). The angler was particularly aggressive because he had been caught in the same place for the same offence last year. In another case an angler gave a false identity and nearly ended up being arrested. The following day the same angler was checked at a different fishery but had subsequently bought two valid rod licences. What’s more, he was fishing with several other anglers and had informed them that the bailiffs were about – his fellow anglers told the officer they had been tempted to fish without a licence but, on the advice of their friend, had bought one that morning online. Sarah Chare, head of fisheries at the Environment Agency, said: The number of anglers caught red-handed is testament to the hard work of our enforcement teams. But worryingly it still shows a blatant disregard for fisheries and the environment. People who don’t buy a licence are cheating other anglers and the future of the sport. The Environment Agency relies on the income from rod licences to continue the important work we do to protect fish stocks, improve fisheries and encourage more people to take up fishing. If you are caught fishing without a rod licence you risk a criminal conviction and a fine. There is no excuse – it costs just £27 for a whole year and is easy to buy from the Post Office website. In addition to the Environment Agency’s rod licence enforcement work, which focused mainly on stillwaters, Angling Trust voluntary bailiffs were also patrolling rivers to detect and report any close season and other fisheries offences. Environment Agency officers were able to respond to their reports and all the intelligence information gathered will help inform future enforcement patrols – they will know who is likely to be fishing illegally when and where. Last year, Environment Agency officers checked more than 70,000 licences and prosecuted more than 2,800 licence cheats. Between them, they were ordered to pay fines and costs in excess of £600,000. To help crack down on unlicensed fishing the Environment Agency urges anyone to report illegal activity by calling 0800 80 70 60. Money raised from rod licence sales is reinvested in the environment, including a whole range of projects to improve facilities for anglers, protect stocks from illegal fishing, plus fish restocking, invasive species eradication, and working with partners to encourage people to take-up fishing for the first time. Annual rod licences for trout and coarse fishing remain at £5 for 12 to 16 year olds, £18 for senior and disabled concessions and £27 for non-concessions. Children under 12 can fish for free. Buying a licence online from the Post Office website saves time and administration costs, which means more of the income can be spent on improving fish stocks and fishing. Rod licence prices have remained unchanged for the last 4 consecutive years. More on rod licences and how to buy one here or direct from the Post Office Anglers can also buy a rod licence by calling the Post Office on 0344 800 5386 or by visiting any Post Office branch.

/government/news/godmanchester-flood-scheme-recognised,"The Environment Agency is celebrating success at the Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) East of England Merit Awards.   Godmanchester flood scheme recognised  Environment Agency Recognition of the recently completed Godmanchester Flood Risk Management Scheme was made for Technical Excellence and Innovation (highly commended), Physical Achievement (merit) and Team Achievement (merit). The Awards were presented by the ICE President, Geoff French, at the annual Merit Awards Dinner as a celebration of civil engineering in the region. Andrew Rouse, Environment Agency Project Manager, said: I am thrilled that all of the hard work and effort put into this project has been recognised by the Institution of Civil Engineers. I thank all those involved – the Regional Flood & Coastal Committee, Cambridgeshire County Council and Huntingdonshire District Council for providing funding; our own Environment Agency officers; Atkins the design engineers; Jackson Civil Engineering and, particularly, the local residents for their support and co-operation in making this happen. Steve Wheatley, Chair to the Regional Flood & Coastal Committee, said: Floods across the country earlier this year have shown again the devastation and misery that flooding brings to people. It is fantastic to see this scheme recognised in this way as it will significantly reduce the risk of flooding in Godmanchester. Councillor Ian Bates, one of the Cambridgeshire County Council representatives on the Regional Flood and Coastal Committee, said: Flooding is devastating and the county council is keen to work with partners to reduce the risk of this happening where we can to our communities. We are pleased that this work in Godmanchester has won an award but more importantly that our communities are at less risk of being flooded. The town of Godmanchester, which had no formal defences, came very close to being flooded in 1998 and properties within low-lying areas are considered to be at significant risk of internal flooding. The Environment Agency worked with the Regional Flood & Coastal Committee, Cambridgeshire County Council and Huntingdonshire District Council since 2009 to agree an appropriate way of protecting properties in the town. The scheme was finally approved in January 2012. The scheme cost £6.8 Million to construct and was jointly funded by Defra, Local Authority Local Levy, direct contributions from Cambridgeshire County Council and Huntingdonshire District Council and private resident contributions. The completed scheme was unveiled on 28 February 2014 and includes a combination of flood walls and flood embankments alongside the River Great Ouse. The new defences will increase the level of flood protection in Godmanchester by reducing the risk of flooding from a 1 in 20 year event to a 1 in 100 year event. The scheme will provide flood protection to 556 properties.

/government/news/set-line-led-to-fine,"Christopher John Haystead has been fined £110 for using an illegal line to catch fish in the River Yare. Set line led to fine  Environment Agency Norwich Magistrates’ Court yesterday (Wed 9) heard that Haystead of Cricket Ground Road, Norwich was caught illegally fishing on 11 December last year while Environment Agency officers were out checking for set lines in the river. Mrs Miriam Tordoff, prosecuting for the Environment Agency, told the court that at Trowse Mill they spotted Haystead crouching down where 4 lines had been staked into the bank. He was seen pulling in the lines and a brown trout was attached to a hook on one of them. The others had bait worms on them. Haystead had 2 carrier bags and a jar of fish heads in his pocket. He told investigating officers that he had not set the lines but had seen some people sleeping rough nearby who had been using them. He checked in the mornings and the brown trout was the first one he had considered taking. Haystead pleaded guilty to using the prohibited fishing line, set for taking or killing trout and freshwater fish. He said he had not realised how serious an offence it was although he does have a rod licence. Mrs Tordoff told the court: Set lines are prohibited as fish can be left on a hook for any amount of time. Unattended lines are also a risk to other wildlife, such as swans. She said there was also a close season for fishing of brown trout between October and March to protect fish stocks during the breeding season. Haystead was also ordered to pay a £20 victim surcharge. He pleaded guilty to: On or about 11 December 2013 on the River Yare at Trowse Mill, Norwich, in the county of Norfolk, you used a prohibited instrument, namely a set-line, for the purpose of taking or killing trout and freshwater fish.

Residents signed up to the Environment Agency’s flood warning service will receive an automated call, and those who follow the camera via twitter will receive alerts and photos when the water levels rise significantly. Speaking about the new camera system, Environment Agency Project Manager, Jamie Sarginson said: “Around 45 properties suffered severe flooding in 2008 along the Illey Brook. Since then both the Environment Agency and Dudley Metropolitan Borough Council have been working closely with the Illey Brook Flood Committee to investigate ways to make the community more flood resilient – and this new camera goes a long way to achieving that goal. “The camera has a high water sensor which will enable us to alert residents approximately 1 hour before water from the Illey Brook reaches the first property. If the correct settings are added to the individuals’ twitter account, then they will be able to hear an alert when images or alarms are tweeted from the camera’s twitter account. The feedback we’ve received from residents has been really positive and we hope it makes a real difference for those potentially at risk of flooding.” The community can also view the cameras via Vision Link Ltd – the company that created the cameras. The pages are automatically updated when new images/ alarms are received. The camera sends images approximately every 4 hours during daylight hours but more images can be requested by Environment Agency staff via the Vision Link mobile site as and when needed allowing us to closely monitor the culvert during an incident."

/government/news/flood-sirens-to-be-tested-in-grimsby-and-cleethorpes,"The Environment Agency will be carrying out annual testing of its flood warning sirens in Grimsby and Cleethorpes next week.   Flood sirens to be tested in Grimsby and Cleethorpes  Environment Agency It has 18 flood warning sirens to warn residents of tidal flooding from the Humber. The sirens were installed in 2006 and are used to warn more than 25,000 households and businesses about imminent tidal flooding. The siren on the Willows Estate, Grimsby is also used to warn residents about flooding from the River Freshney. The sirens will be tested on Friday, 29 August between 10am and midday. Each group of sirens will be sounded 3 times for between 2 and 5 minutes. The siren will be followed by a voice message to advise a test is taking place, then a voice message will be heard giving a Severe Flood Warning. Once the message has finished, a wailing noise will be made and a message to confirm a test has been carried out will be played. Anyone who hears the sirens between 10am and midday does not need to take action. If the Environment Agency expects flooding during the testing, it will use Floodline Warnings Direct to warn businesses, while local radio stations will broadcast the latest information. Environment Agency staff will be in the Fresheny Place Shopping Centre on Thursday 28 August from 9am to 5pm to answer questions about the sirens and flood risk. Information will be available to advise people how to prepare for flooding and what actions they need to take when they hear the sirens. Claire Rose, Flood Resilience Team Leader, said: Our flood defences reduce the risk of flooding to thousands of homes and businesses in Grimsby and Cleethorpes, but there is always a risk that they can fail or be overwhelmed. It is important people know what to do before, during and after a flood and identify actions they can take to protect themselves and their property. We’d love people to come and see us in Freshney Place to learn more about flood risk and what they can do to help themselves. It is important we test the sirens to make sure they will work during an emergency but we would like to apologise for any inconvenience the testing may cause.

/government/news/time-ticks-for-norfolk-coastal-comments,"People on the coast between Hunstanton Cliffs and Wolferton Creek have just a week left to share their views on its future management. Time ticks for Norfolk coastal comments  Environment Agency Wash East consultation soon closes A plan by the Environment Agency and Borough Council of King’s Lynn & West Norfolk has recommended several options and they are keen to hear what people think by Monday (8 Sept). The Wash East Coastal Management Strategy identifies a range of options from ‘doing nothing’ to improving the standard of protection to a 1 in 75 chance of flooding in any one year along the frontage. The strategy recommends an ‘adaptable’ approach to the future management of this coastline to not preclude any future opportunities for improving the standard of protection - dependent on available funding. Three public drop-in events at the start of the formal consultation process, which began on 28 July 2014, were well attended and formal feedback was given. Most suitable Julie Foley, Area Manager for the Environment Agency said: “The strategy sets out to identify the most suitable way of managing flood and coastal erosion risk to local communities, whilst protecting internationally important natural and historic environments along this stretch of the Norfolk Coast. “Defences were severely tested during the December tidal surge. We must plan now for the future protection of this coastline from the effects of flooding and coastal erosion in a changing climate.” Cllr Brian Long, Cabinet Member for Environment at the Borough Council said: “It is vital that people take the opportunity to respond to this consultation. We have worked hard to make sure we have captured local knowledge in developing this strategy and it is important that we get feedback on the actions contained within.” The consultation document is the culmination of over 4 years work throughout which the strategy team has involved representatives from the local communities and businesses to make sure that local knowledge and experience was captured. How to It can be accessed online at https://consult.environment-agency.gov.uk/portal/re/ang/flood/wecs/public Alternatively, hard copies of the consultation are available at Environment Agency Offices in Wisbech Road, King’s Lynn or Bromholme Lane, Brampton near Huntingdon and at the Borough Council offices in Chapel Street, King’s Lynn and Valentine Road, Hunstanton.

/government/news/fishing-for-a-brighter-future,"Young people encouraged to give fishing a go to boost their health and improve school performance.   Fishing for a brighter future  Environment Agency As children return to the classroom this week, the Environment Agency is working with the Angling Trust to encourage schools to promote fishing to pupils. The Environment Agency and the Angling Trust have been working in partnership to increase participation in angling. The Angling Trust is responsible for delivering the National Angling Strategy. Fishing has proven health, social and educational benefits. It can help pupils improve personal skills such as communication, concentration, discipline, and can even reduce crime and truancy. One school in the North West is already leading the way. The Environment Agency has been working with Smithills School and Bolton Angling Club to add angling to the curriculum. Smithills is one of the only schools in the country offering fishing activities to its students onsite and even has seven members of staff who are professionally qualified angling coaches. The school has set up its own angling club , which meets weekly during term time, and has a school angling team that competes with other clubs at weekends. The Environment Agency has worked with the school to provide safe access to the water, including disabled access, to ensure the pupils and the wider community can enjoy fishing safely at the lake on the school grounds, which is owned by Bolton Angling Club. Schools don’t need to have their own onsite lake. Any school interested in finding out more should contact the Angling Trust, where a regional officer can help link a qualified and licenced angling coach to a school and help ensure that high standards are established early on. They can also assist with grant applications to provide equipment and to improve facilities along with advice on how to get started. Local information on fisheries, tackle shops and instructors can be found on the FishingInfo website . Sarah Chare, head of fisheries at the Environment Agency, said: “Fishing is an excellent way to enjoy the outdoors, has great health, welfare and educational benefits and it is important to our economy. Smithills is an excellent example of how a school is using fishing to help pupils learn. We’d really like to see more schools doing the same.” Alec Cottrill, Smithills headteacher, said: “Fishing has become part of school life. It allows pupils to learn about the environment especially about the water cycle, the value of water, weather patterns and the effect humans can have on all of these. In science they build an understanding of plants and animals, photosynthesis and food chains. There are connections with many other areas of the curriculum too, for example, fishing can be linked to numeracy so pupils understand about measuring water depths and using weights to balance floats.” Surveys show that more than 10% of 12 year olds have already been fishing and as many again would like to go – if they had a little help. The Environment Agency is working with the Angling Trust to provide that help. Angling can play a very cost-effective role in helping young people suffering from exclusion. Projects such as Get Hooked on Fishing use angling as a tool to help social inclusion and show very high success rates. Sarah Collins, chief executive of the charity Get Hooked on Fishing, said: “Get Hooked on Fishing has been helping young people, their families and communities access the personal, social, educational, health and well-being benefits of fishing for almost 15 years. Our work can create life-changing opportunities. For example, in one instance, a young boy on the verge of exclusion got involved with one of our projects and is now at college having excelled in his GCSEs.” Buying an annual rod licence is easy and fishing is free for children under 12. A trout and coarse fishing licence remains at £5 for 12 to 16 year olds and £27 for adults. Rod licences are available from the Post Office . Buying a rod licence online from the Post Office website saves time and administration costs, which means more of the income can be spent on improving fish stocks and fishing.

/government/news/biggest-coastal-flood-management-scheme-completed,"UK’s biggest ever coastal realignment scheme at Steart, a joint project between WWT and Environment Agency, has been completed.  Biggest coastal flood management scheme completed  Environment Agency The construction of Steart Marshes means the Environment Agency can continue its maintenance of flood risk schemes elsewhere in the Severn Estuary that protect 100,000 homes and businesses. Rising sea levels are predicted to result in loss of inter-tidal habitat in the Severn Estuary. Steart Marshes will replace about half of this loss and reduce the flood risk for local communities. Just before 7am on Monday 8 September, high tides entered 250 hectares of low-lying land for the first time in centuries, through a newly excavated 200 metre gap in the Parrett Estuary coastal embankments. People and property remain protected by newly constructed flood risk management scheme. Over the coming months and years salt-tolerant plants will colonise the area and form a new saltmarsh. The Wildfowl & Wetlands Trust (WWT) and Environment Agency’s Steart Marshes scheme uses the shallow gradient and coarse vegetation of the saltmarsh to absorb wave energy naturally. This will help to protect local villages from storm surges, and protect the newly constructed flood banks from erosion so that they last longer. WWT Chief Executive Martin Spray said: We need to be brave and bold if we are going to deal with the impacts of climate change. WWT Steart Marshes proves you can protect homes and businesses by using wetland technology that works with nature, not against it. Climate change is here now. Last winter was the wettest on record and we suffered the worst storms for 20 years. I want to give full credit to the villagers of the Steart Peninsula for getting behind this idea, helping to shape it and helping to save the peninsula from being lost to rising sea levels. Richard Cox, for the Environment Agency, said: Over 200km of coastal banks around the Severn Estuary reduce flood risk to more than 100,000 homes and businesses, a benefit valued at £5 billion. There is an ongoing need to maintain these structures. The Steart project will directly protect homes, businesses and the surrounding infrastructure. The National Grid power lines into Hinkley Point power station are a key element of the national infrastructure protected by the scheme. Saltmarsh is a natural flood risk management scheme. Like coral reefs or mangroves in the tropics, saltmarsh takes energy out of the tide and reduces wave height. At Steart Marshes the new flood embankments are set behind 100s of metres of saltmarsh which will reduce the impact of high tides on them, bringing down maintenance costs and prolonging their life. Half a million cubic metres of soil were dug and moved to create new and improved flood banks. The area is being managed as farmland and a nature reserve and in time the creek system should become a nursery for commercial fish stocks such as sea bass. Steart Marshes has been carefully landscaped over the last two years and paths and bridleways have been created and improved to help more people enjoy the landscape. Local residents have played a key part in creating the scheme; several even took part in a sweep of the land before the seawater flowed in, to move any mammals or reptiles. WWT plan to develop opportunities at Steart Marshes for young people to learn conservation and heritage skills that will lead to jobs in the South West. Saltmarshes are part of Britain’s rich coastal heritage. It’s the landscape that inspired Charles Dickens’ “Great Expectations” and many paintings by JMW Turner. As well as protecting the country from coastal flooding, and filtering pollution that would otherwise flow into the sea, saltmarshes are home to some of Britain’s most iconic wildlife – the Severn Estuary saltmarshes alone support more than 70,000 water birds.

Do you want to make a difference to flood risk in the South West?  Environment Agency The Environment Agency is looking for a new Chairman for the Wessex Regional Flood and Coastal Committee (RFCC). Being a RFCC member is an exciting opportunity to help guide local flood and coastal management across the whole area and make a real difference to people’s lives and to the environment we live in. The Wessex RFCC covers Somerset, Dorset, Bristol, most of Wiltshire and parts of Gloucestershire and Hampshire. The successful applicant will play an important role in deciding on local priorities, raising local levies, approving programmes of work, and supporting us and Lead Local Flood Authorities in working with communities and other partners. They will have a key role in balancing local priorities and making sure that investment is co-ordinated at the river catchment and shoreline scale, as well as championing the consideration of climate change impacts in local decision making. RFCCs bring together local councillors and independent representatives to oversee a multi-million pound programme of work. As Chairman, the person will lead the way in setting strategic priorities for managing flood and coastal erosion risk in partnership with others. To succeed in this challenging role, the person will need to bring together diverse interests and objectives with fairness to ensure this important work is done effectively while achieving value for money for the public purse. This calls for strong leadership, chairing and communication skills, plus a determined yet diplomatic approach to often difficult negotiations. Nick Gupta, the Environment Agency’s Area Manager for Wessex, said: We’re looking for a person who is persuasive and able to influence change, who is used to making difficult decisions, and who can make a positive difference to communities, the environment and the local economy in the face of a changing climate. Never has it been more important to bring together all those who can help reduce the risk of flooding to the thousands of people who live in the area. In many ways the chair of this committee will be a sounding board for professional opinion – acting as an adviser and critical friend to the Agency. The person will need to understand how flood and coastal risk affects local communities, be used to operating at the highest level, and have the credibility to work closely with the public and private sectors to deliver results. This is highly satisfying work and an outstanding opportunity for a person of very high calibre.

/government/news/wiltshire-waste-company-boss-prosecuted-for-environmental-offences,"A Wiltshire man has received a suspended prison sentence after he was caught illegally transporting and storing clinical waste.  Wiltshire waste company boss prosecuted for environmental offences  Environment Agency Christopher Downs was also banned from being a company director for two years, ordered to carry out 100 hours community service and to pay £5,500 costs. The case was brought by the Environment Agency. In November 2011 an Agency officer visited the defendant in Salisbury and saw he was bringing clinical waste to the site without an environmental permit. He had previously registered as a waste carrier and was trading as a company called Prowaste Solutions. The business was located behind a children’s nursery. After receiving advice from the Agency, Christopher Downs, moved to a more suitable location on the Ashfield Trading Estate, Salisbury. Magistrates heard how the defendant made a number of permit applications, but on each occasion he either failed to provide sufficient information or pay the necessary application fee. In November 2012, Christopher Downs started bringing general waste to the site as well as clinical waste despite being told on numerous occasions he needed an environmental permit. In February 2013 he obtained an ‘exemption’ that allowed him to take in separated recyclable waste such as cardboard, plastic and metals. However, he also continued to bring general waste to the site without a permit. Stephanie Marriott for the Environment Agency said: Environmental permits are important because they help safeguard the environment and human health. The defendant had every opportunity to obtain a permit, but chose ignore the advice he was given and continued to operate illegally. In October 2013 the Agency served Christopher Downs with a legal notice to prevent him from bringing general waste to his business premises. At a recent court hearing, Downs was found guilty by Salisbury magistrates o operating a regulated waste facility on land in Estcourt Road, Salisbury without an environmental permit contrary to Section 12(1)(a) and 38(1)(a) of the Environmental Permitting Regulations 2010. As a director of the company, he was also convicted of giving his consent or connivance to operate an illegal waste facility on the Ashfield Industrial Estate, Salisbury. Downs, of Wessex Road, Salisbury, returned to court for final sentencing on May 19. The 16-week prison sentence was suspended for two years. He was also ordered to pay an £80 Victim Surcharge and carry out the 100 hours community service over the next 12 months. There was no separate penalty for the connivance offence. ENDS"

Rivers in the area offer barbel and chub in the Swale, pike and perch in the Ouse. A variety of stillwaters are also home to carp, bream and tench, while the trout fishing at in many of our reservoirs is good quality. There are over 6,000 fisheries listed on our online database to find a location close to you - explore them on the fishinginfo website Examples of where the rod licence money goes in Yorkshire: Creating new fish passes which can be used by all species, notably at Sprotborough where the fish pass has now opened up over half the length of the river to all species of fish including eels. This will help the burgeoning fish populations reach their full potential. Bankside improvements on many rivers designed to provide cover and sources of food for fish. Work undertaken with the Yorkshire Dales Rivers Trust for example has led to bankside planting and fencing on tributaries of the River Ure which will benefit fish and help control erosion and reduce the amount of sediment entering the river. In Broughton Beck, a tributary of the River Aire, we worked with volunteers from Forest of Bradford to securely install woody debris to narrow the channel, vary flows and provide cover for fish. We have created two ark sites in secret locations to ensure populations of pure bred crucian carp are available into the future. These fish can be used by our fish farm in Nottingham to ensure the remarkable native fish are available for future stocking programmes for years to come. We have worked with angling clubs and fishery owners to improve access to a number of fisheries including at Cooper Bridge fishery near Huddersfield. When fish get into difficulties, for example being stranded after flooding, we help rescue fish and return them to the rivers they came from. When fish from the River Ouse became stranded in Rowntree Park in York we netted roach, perch and pike and safely returned them to the river."
/government/news/yorkshire-anglers-warned-to-obey-the-law,"Bank Holiday weekend enforcement blitz reels in offenders Yorkshire anglers warned to obey the law  Environment Agency Anglers in Yorkshire are being reminded to ensure they abide by national and local byelaws as enforcement officers cast their net on illegal fishing. During the Bank Holiday weekend, from 24 to 26 May, Environment Agency fisheries enforcement officers checked 361 anglers at 21 separate locations using local knowledge and intelligence to catch offenders. During these three days, 57 people were reported for various fisheries offences. Most of these were fishing without a licence, although one offender was caught coarse fishing despite the close season being in operation at that location. Peter Mischenko, fisheries technical officer at the Environment Agency, said: It is absolutely vital that anglers obey the laws relating to rod licences and the coarse fish close season to protect our fisheries. Money from rod licences goes straight back into trout and freshwater fisheries. People who fish without a rod licence are having a direct effect on the work we can deliver. The close season in our rivers is important to allow the fish time to breed and spawn and so maintain a healthy stock of fish. Without it, our fisheries would be put at risk. We use intelligence gathered previously to indicate the locations where anglers are likely to be fishing illegally, and we concentrated our efforts towards those areas. We shall continue to target those waters where evasion and illegal activity is high and those caught may be prosecuted. Anyone who suspects illegal fishing to be taking place should report the matter to the Environment Agency’s incident hotline, on 0800 807060. Find out more about how to buy a rod licence here"

/government/news/take-time-to-check-your-oil-tank,"Autumn is here and it is the time of year when many households will be getting oil delivered ready for winter. Take time to check your oil tank  Environment Agency It is also the time of year when the Environment Agency urges people to check their oil tanks to protect the environment and reduce the risk of potentially large financial losses. Environment Officer Alison Hyman said: Heating oil can cause serious problems if it gets into the environment. It can pollute rivers, harm wildlife and contaminate ground and drinking water. But it’s not just the cost of losing the oil that can be expensive, clean up costs can be large and are not always covered by household insurance policies. This is why it is vital that oil is only ever stored in tanks that are in good condition. Both the tank and pipe work should be regularly inspected and people should never buy more oil than they can safely store. Householders with domestic oil tanks should take the following action to ensure they are safe for use. Site tanks as far away as possible from drains, streams and ponds. Inspect tanks, pipes and other equipment for leaks, damage and interference once a week. Any problems should be fixed as soon as possible by an Oil Firing Technical Association (OFTEC) technician. For more information visit http://www.oftec.org.uk/ Arrange for the boiler and tank to be serviced at least once a year by an (OFTEC) technician. This should include any underground pipe work. Monitor how much oil you use. If the volume of oil being used suddenly increases, there could be a leak. Supervise oil deliveries. Never allow your tank to be overfilled and do not order more oil than you can safely store. Check your home insurance covers clean up costs on both your property and neighbouring land. Always notify insurers immediately in the event of a spill or suspected spill. If a tank starts leaking. Try to stop the oil soaking into the ground or going down drains. Contact your insurance company to arrange for an OFTEC technician or UKSpill-accredited clean-up company. For more information visit http://www.ukspill.org/ Secondary containment (such as a bund) will prevent oil from escaping into the environment if a leak occurs. This is a legal requirement for domestic tanks which store more than 3,500 litres. To report an oil spill or leak, people should contact the Environment Agency’s 24-hour emergency hotline on 0800 807060."

/government/news/flood-defence-repair-work-completed-on-chesil-beach,"Emergency flood defence repair work to damage caused this year by a succession of winters storms on Chesil Beach in Portland, Dorset, will be completed on 2 October 2014 by the Environment Agency and Weymouth & Portland Borough Council. Flood defence repair work completed on Chesil Beach  Environment Agency The storms caused significant damage and cumulative impacts to the system of beach defences at Chesil Cove and the two organisations have been working together to repair the damage caused. The sea wall, Gabion Castle, gabion crest protection mattresses and the Monsoon Drain have all been repaired and there has been extensive re-profiling of the shingle beach to reinstate protection. The Environment Agency continues to survey and gather data to inform future beach management and emergency response. Representatives from the media are invited to come along and see the repairs at 11am on 2 October and witness a siren demonstration. The meeting point is the top of Brandy Row, Portland, near the beach promenade. Neil Watson for the Environment Agency said: Chesil beach took a pounding during the coastal storms last winter, and 150,000 cubic metres of shingle was lost from the beach that protects Chiswell. We have been busy ever since, initially replenishing lost shingle and more recently, repairing the gabion castle and crest protection mattresses. This work provides key protection to the community of Chiswell and the road connecting Portland to Weymouth. We have worked closely with partners including framework contractors, other risk management authorities, emergency responders and the military. We have delivered value for money on the repairs by working closely with Weymouth and Portland Council and by using the same contractor. The bulk of the work has been completed although the handrail on the gabion castle needs to be fitted and the last section of the monsoon drain has still to be constructed. The Agency will also hold a siren test on the same day, October 2, between 11-12pm to ensure it is prepared for any future winter storms. This will also help test the community and personal flood plans. Cllr Ian Roebuck, Briefholder for Environment and Sustainability at Weymouth & Portland Borough Council, said: It is very positive news for residents on Portland that the programme to repair the sea defences at Chesil Beach has been completed. I would like to pay tribute to the Environment Agency and our engineering team for their excellent work. We must recognise that it is very likely that we will have more frequent occasions of severe weather to test the defences in the future. As a result, joint working with the Environment Agency will be essential if we are going to be able to continue to offer protection to the many homes and businesses in the Chesil Cove area. Our success under this recent battering is a very positive precedent for our ongoing policies."

Damaged flood gate secured by Environment Agency and Polperro Harbour Trust  Environment Agency The Environment Agency successfully stabilised the gate ahead of two days of high tides after its owners, Polperro Harbour Trust spotted a problem following several days of storms. Yesterday engineers surveyed the damage and began to finalise a plan to start repairing the gate as early as next week. The gate will remain in a closed position until fixed. Although this will temporarily prevent boats entering or leaving the harbour, the Environment Agency is working to support the Harbour Trust to get these repairs completed as soon as practical to restore access for local fishermen and pleasure boats. Steve Douglas, Operations Manager for the Environment Agency said: The emergency works have prevented the Polperro tide gate from being more seriously damaged and minimised flood risk to local people and property. We will continue to work closely with the Harbour Trust, Cornwall Council and our partners at the local resilience forum to ensure that contingency plans are in place in the event of the gate suffering further damage. I’m hopeful that repairs can be completed within the next month. During this time if anyone considers that they have suffered loss or damage as a result of the works at Polperro they should contact the Environment Agency’s Estates Department, who will be able to discuss this further with them.

/government/news/quagga-mussel-discovered-for-first-time-in-uk,"The invasive species, the quagga mussel (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis), has been discovered in the south east.   Quagga mussel discovered for first time in UK  Environment Agency The discovery was made by Environment Agency teams carrying out routine water quality testing on River Wraysbury. It has subsequently been found in the nearby Wraysbury reservoir too. The identification was confirmed by Dr David Aldridge of Cambridge University on 1 October 2014. Since the mussel was identified the Environment Agency has been working with partners including Thames Water, Angling Trust and local angling clubs, to put biosecurity measures in place. Work is now taking place to monitor the River Thames and reservoirs in the local area to investigate the extent of the problem and the distance that the quagga mussel has spread. Anglers and boaters can play an important part and everyone is urged to help stop the spread of this species by following the ‘check, clean, dry’ approach and thoroughly cleaning any equipment. The quagga mussel is a prolific breeder – a fully mature female mussel is capable of producing up to one million eggs per year. Due to its ability to filter out large quantities of nutrients and to breed quickly, the quagga mussel can significantly reduce native populations and affect freshwater ecosystems. It can outcompete native mussels. This alters the ecology of the habitats it invades. It can also block water pipes and smother boats’ hulls. Sarah Chare, deputy director of fisheries and biodiversity at the Environment Agency, said: Invasive species – such as the quagga mussel – cost the UK economy in excess of £1.8 billion every year. And while Britain’s rivers are the healthiest for over 20 years, rivers that harbour non-native species could fall short of tough EU targets. The quagga mussel is a highly invasive non-native species, affecting water quality and clogging up pipes. We are monitoring the extent of its spread and working closely with partners to ensure they are aware of it. If you spot one then please report it to us through the online recording form. Like the zebra mussel and killer shrimp this species comes from the Ponto-Caspian region – an area around the Black and Caspian seas in south-east Europe. Simon Earl, head of water production at Thames Water, said: Another invasive species is the last thing we need clogging up our network. But we have a lot of experience in dealing with zebra mussels, which are similar to quagga mussels, and there is no threat to the quality of the water we supply to our customers. We’ll continue to work closely with the Environment Agency to monitor the mussels discovered at Wraysbury reservoir. Mark Owen, head of freshwater at the Angling Trust, said: It’s vitally important that all water users, including anglers, take every possible precaution to stop this species spreading throughout the UK. Quagga mussels could do untold damage to freshwater and estuarine environments if they are allowed to spread which could have a significant impact on marine and freshwater fish stocks. The mussels tend to be about the size of a human thumbnail but can grow to about 4cm. The larvae of quagga mussel are not visible to the naked eye, which makes drying a critical step in applying good biosecurity. There’s good evidence that rinsing or soaking equipment in hot water increases the chance of killing larvae and adults, and is a suggested addition to the Check, Clean, Dry approach. Check, Clean, Dry is important not only to help slow the spread of this species, but also other invasive species that might be present in our waterways. It is especially important to prevent the spread of invasive non-native species to isolated, vulnerable or protected sites. More information and advice on the quagga mussel and advice on how to slow its spread can be found on the Non-native Species Secretariat web pages: http://www.nonnativespecies.org/alerts/quaggamussel ."

King’s Lynn Internal Drainage Board take on Norfolk rivers  Environment Agency Changes to the future management of these rivers will benefit both parties and local communities. Landowners and the public were asked for their views in January 2014 and following a formal legal process the rivers Babingley, Ingol and Heacham have been formally reclassified from ‘Main River’ to ‘Ordinary Watercourse’. Localism Julie Foley, Area Manager for the Environment Agency, said: We are happy to work with the King’s Lynn Internal Drainage Board to provide an alternative solution for the maintenance of these 3 watercourses. This arrangement supports the Government’s ‘localism’ agenda in that it would transfer flood risk management powers and responsibilities to the local community (in the form of the IDB) and would allow local beneficiaries to fund and prioritise river maintenance works. The final decision was approved by the Anglian (Central) Regional Flood & Coastal Committee and Defra through the Secretary of State. Permissive Powers This new agreement will mean that the King’s Lynn Internal Drainage Board, under the Land Drainage Act (Section 14), will have ‘permissive powers’ to carry out maintenance on these 3 watercourses. They will not, however, have a statutory ‘duty’ to carry out work. The King’s Lynn Internal Drainage Board’s Byelaws (KLIDBB) will now apply along the watercourses and these can be found at KLIDBB . Plans to undertake any works within 9 metres to either side of any of these watercourses are likely to require prior written consent from the Board. The Environment Agency’s Byelaws will also still apply if the proposed works are within 9 metres of any sea defence. The primary responsibility for maintenance of a watercourse in common law still rests with the riparian landowner. Maintenance Phil Camamile, Chief Executive for the Water Management Alliance, said: We are delighted that the 3 rivers have finally come home! We will be working with the Norfolk Rivers Trust and other partners to develop a maintenance programme for them, which we are very optimistic about. We would welcome other opportunities to work with the Environment Agency in this way.

/government/news/siren-testing-in-the-upper-calder-valley,"Flood sirens in Walsden, Todmorden, Hebden Bridge and Mytholmroyd will be tested as part of the Environment Agency’s annual maintenance.  Siren testing in the upper Calder Valley  Environment Agency The Environment Agency will be testing flood warning sirens in Walsden, Todmorden, Hebden Bridge and Mytholmroyd next week (Thursday 30 October 2014) as part of annual maintenance tests. The test is planned ahead of the Environment Agency’s flood action campaign in November, and the flood groups in the upper Calder Valley are taking the opportunity to test their own plans and encourage others to get involved. The Environment Agency uses the sirens to warn the upper Calder Valley communities when rivers are expected to flood. There are 8 sirens in the area with an audibility level similar to that used by emergency vehicles. The sirens will be tested on Thursday 30 October at: 10:30am – Todmorden and Walsden midday – Hebden Bridge 1pm – Mytholmroyd Each test will last for 2 minutes. Residents and businesses in the towns do not need to take any action when hearing the sirens at these times. Loud hailer vehicles will be used to alert people to the tests, ahead of the sirens being sounded. Engagement officer at the Environment Agency, Graham Lindsey said: It is important that we test the sirens to check that they are working properly and can be triggered remotely from our incident room in Leeds. Although no action needs to be taken during the test, people need to be aware that if they hear the sirens at any other time, then this means that flooding is expected. Flood water is dangerous, particularly in these areas where water cascading down from the steep surrounding hills means flooding can happen very quickly and with little warning. We would ask people not to put themselves at danger by driving or walking through fast moving flood water. We are also encouraging local residents and businesses to put together a flood plan to keep themselves and their families safe.” “After checking audibility of the sirens, our officers will wait at each siren after it has sounded so that any interested residents can come and speak to us about how to stay safe in a flash flood and how to be as prepared as possible. Please also take the chance to speak to your local flood group, who will be out on the day, to speak to locals about the flood plans they have developed and encourage more people to get involved.” Flood groups will be present at the following times: Todmorden Market, 10am to 1pm Hebden Bridge market place, 11.30am to 1pm Mytholmroyd - various locations Calderdale Council’s leader, Cllr Stephen Baines, said: Since the unprecedented floods of 2012 we have been working hard with local communities to develop ways to be more ready for flooding in the future. The three flood groups have done a great job of putting plans together on how they can respond before, during and after a flood. They need more people involved in this, so please go and find out how you can help, and also what you can do yourself to have a flood plan for your home or business. During the afternoon of Thursday 30 October, alongside the Environment Agency, we will be supporting the 3 groups to test their flood plans by running through a simulated flooding scenario. If you have a flood plan, it’s really important to regularly test it so you are confident that it will work in a real flood.

Suspended prison sentence for March skip man and £47,000 to pay  Environment Agency He had been operating Dial a Skip for more than a year, undercutting competitors. Ahmed, aged 29, who pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing to running an illegal waste site and failing to produce waste transfer notes, was sentenced to 32 weeks in prison suspended for 18 months for running the site. He was also ordered to do 200 hours unpaid work in the community. A £30,000 confiscation order was made against him with a 9 month prison sentence in default and he was ordered to pay £17,000 full costs and £100 victim surcharge. Illegal skip business attracted rats Peterborugh Crown Court heard he rented a unit at Gaul Farm Industrial Estate in March and dumped waste there and in another unit on the same site, rented by his wife, as well as several outside areas around the site. The waste on the site rotted and became rat-infested causing concerns to people living nearby. Mrs Anne-Lise McDonald, prosecuting, said Ahmed knew he needed a permit to operate the site as a waste dump or sorting station and had been advised by environment officers. He was being paid to take waste and was depositing and treating it illegally on the site. She said Ahmed would have had to make major changes to the site before a permit could have been granted so had saved money by not doing that. He would also have had to consider health and safety and the potential impact on the environment. Environment Agency surveillance caught Ahmed supervising waste being tipped at the back of the site and then sorting it, actions he later tried to deny. He was twice served a notice to produce waste transfer notes but failed to do so and later withdrew a waste permit application he had submitted. Mrs McDonald told the court that Ahmed had advertised his business on Ebay even though he had told an environment officer that he would not be selling it. In it he claimed to run 25 skips a week. Mr Andrew Thomas QC told the court Ahmed was naive and did not completely ignore the advice of the Environment Agency. Judge Sean Enright said the waste site was an eyesore and a health hazard resulting in large rats. He said Ahmed misled the Environment Agency even in a taped interview. Ahmed was undercutting his competitors and the offence was committed for financial gain. He said the custody threshold had been crossed but custody could be suspended because he had been naive. After the hearing Environment Agency officer Emma Viner said: Whilst seeming to be co-operative Ahmed repeatedly lied to us including in the interview under caution. When a business operates without a permit, it is able to undercut its permitted competitors and can result in more people operating illegally to compete. Waste crime puts people and the environment at risk and we are taking tough action to deal with criminal behaviour."

/government/news/staffordshire-company-ordered-to-pay-33621-for-polluting-local-brook,"On Wednesday 5 November, Ibstock Bricks (1996) Limited pleaded guilty to the charge of breaching an environmental discharge consent. Staffordshire company ordered to pay £33,621 for polluting local brook  Environment Agency The company, based in Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire was fined £27,000, ordered to pay £6,501.25 in costs, along with a £120 victim surcharge. The charge was brought by the Environment Agency under Regulations 38(2) of the Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2010. This case concerned the pollution of the Silverdale Brook (also locally known as the Lyme Brook) with clay material from the Knutton Quarry site based at Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire, spreading over 3.5 kilometres. The site operates with an environmental discharge consent granted by the Environment Agency. The conditions of the discharge consent are specifically tailored to the operations of the site in order to protect the environment from potentially polluting discharges that enter watercourses. On the 15 August 2013, a company representative contacted the Environment Agency to advise that due to a failure in the discharge equipment at the site, the consent limit had been exceeded and had caused visible pollution to the Silverdale Brook. Prompt investigation and action by the Environment Agency limited the extent of the pollution, although polluting material could have been discharged into the watercourse for anything up to a 13 hour period. The company co-operated with the Environment Agency throughout the investigation. It confirmed that the cause of the pollution was the result of a mechanical failure in their equipment. There was no failsafe device to ensure that polluting material was not pumped into the Brook following this failure. This had now been rectified. Speaking after the case, an Environment Agency officer in charge of the investigation said: “Although Ibstock Bricks (1996) Limited reported the discharge to us, it was too late to prevent the pollution of the Silverdale Brook. We do everything we can to protect the environment, local rivers and watercourses. This case sends out a clear message that we will not hesitate to prosecute as necessary when environmental damage is caused.” In mitigation, the company expressed its remorse and accepted responsibility for the pollution incident."

/government/news/weeding-out-non-native-invasive-species-in-cambridgeshire,"Environment Agency crews have been hard at work along the Ely Ouse and River Cam removing tons of Floating Pennywort.     Weeding out non-native invasive species in Cambridgeshire  Environment Agency Maintenance teams are more than half way through a 6-week programme, removing the invasive non-native species (INNS) to try to stop it spreading further. Using floating weed harvesters and lifters, the Environment Agency teams have removed more than 1000 tonnes of wet cut invasive weed, while another team followed up behind, hand removing and spraying the smaller pieces of weed. Floating Pennywort is normally found in tropical aquaria and garden ponds. It is, however, being found more and more in rivers across the country. It forms very dense mats of vegetation which can grow rapidly (up to 20 centimetres per day) out from the riverbanks. These mats have the potential to cause serious problems for fish and anglers by suffocating fish and preventing access to the water. The plant also obstructs movements of animals and boats, restricting navigation and recreational use of watercourses. Darren Trumper, Environment Agency Operations Delivery Team Leader said: Floating Pennywort has become a major problem for us all in the River Cam and Ely Ouse. Some of the Floating Pennywort mats we are removing from the riverbanks along the Ely Ouse are 22 metres long and 10 metres wide, and can be a depth size of about 30 millimetres. In one location the teams removed a mat weighing 1.7 tonnes! An especially worrying factor in the infestation is the invasion of the River Cam Washes, which is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and crucial to all kinds of wildlife. The rivers and its tributaries in our area provide the perfect breeding ground for Floating Pennywort which has formed dense mats. These block out oxygen and light in what was very good aquatic habitats for fish, and native plants. It also deprives birds and creatures from feeding from the waters. Native to North America, Floating Pennywort is a fast growing invasive species of freshwater plant. It is widespread and well established in the south and east of England and appears to be spreading rapidly north and westwards. As such, this makes it one of many high priority invasive non-native plant species in Great Britain. To see a film of the Environment Agency’s work to remove weed from our rivers please visit their YouTube channel at: http://www.youtube.com/user/EnvironmentAgencyTV The Environment Agency is also asking people who are out and about to help to track down these problem plants by using a free App called ‘PlantTracker’. PlantTracker is available free from the iTunes App Store and Android Market by searching for PlantTracker (one word), or from the website http://PlantTracker.naturelocator.org/ where people can also follow the progress of the project and the reports that are coming in.

/government/news/trout-make-spawning-return-to-north-east-river,"Years of industrial use is reversed by Environment Agency and partners as Sea Trout return to spawn on the River Wear  Trout make spawning return to North East river  Environment Agency Sea trout are once again returning to spawn in a large north east stream following huge improvements in water quality and measures to help wildlife. Cong Burn, a tributary of the River Wear, was once a watercourse polluted through years of neglect from industry. Parts of it had also been modified by culverts to free up land for roads and other infrastructure, which can also create problems for river wildlife, including fish. Although there is still work to do to clean up the burn sea trout – an excellent indicator of water quality – are returning there to spawn. Fisheries officer Paul Frear said: “There are now more than 20 spawning areas in the burn compared to the handful we’ve seen in previous years. “This is excellent news and shows that the conditions are right for the fish to return.” The Environment Agency has paid for members of Chester-le-Street Angling Club to remove a weir and make changes to underground culverts to help fish move along the watercourse. Improvements to the quality of the water in Cong Burn have been made following water company investment at Hustledown sewage treatment works."
/government/news/revised-plans-for-habitat-creation-on-exe-estuary,"The Exe Estuary Flood and Coastal Risk Management Strategy identified the need for intertidal habitat to be created to offset that being lost as a result of the foreshore being ‘squeezed’ due to predicted sea level rise.  Revised plans for habitat creation on Exe estuary  Environment Agency There is a legal requirement for the Environment Agency to do this for internationally important habitats like those in the Exe estuary. Following a review of all feasible sites in 2013, two preferred sites – the west bank of the River Clyst and the Kenn Valley – were selected for more detailed investigation. These investigations are now complete and show that the Clyst site will not provide the habitat suitable to meet the legal requirement, and the Environment Agency will no longer progress the work here. The Agency still plans to carry out work in the Kenn Valley, and will seek other sites for future intertidal habitat creation. Mike Williams, for the Environment Agency, said In the short term, we intend to deliver the required compensatory habitat in the lower Kenn Valley. This will be the best site for creating the intertidal habitat required. However, our long term aspiration for the Clyst remains to reconnect the river to the floodplain, as this will be the most sustainable way to manage flood risk in the future. We are also planning improvements to flood defences at Clyst St Mary to reduce the flood risk to this community and alterations to embankments could form part of this project if landowners agree.

/government/news/lincoln-waste-company-director-sentenced-to-prison,"Thousands of tonnes of waste were deposited at a Lincoln site in breach of an environmental permit and planning conditions.   Lincoln waste company director sentenced to prison  Environment Agency Despite having its permit revoked by the Environment Agency and 2 enforcement notices and 2 breach of condition notices served by Lincolnshire County Council, SOS Skip Hire and Haulage took in even more waste at its site in Dale Street. The company’s sole director, Shaun Nigel Dixon, aged 47, has today (Mon) been sentenced to 12 months in prison, suspended for 2 years and ordered to do 200 hours unpaid work in the community, after the court heard he allowed nearly 20,000 tonnes of waste to be brought to the site when the limit was only 1,100 tonnes. The waste was 7 to 8 metres high in places, breaching planning conditions. 5 year disqualification Recorder Mr GRW Evans QC sitting at Lincoln Crown Court also disqualified him from being a company director for 5 years and issued a regulation 44 order requiring him to produce a plan for how he is going to clear the site. Sentencing he said that this was a deliberate and flagrant breach of the law and Dixon dealt with the business in an amateurish way. Dixon, who pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing, was also ordered to pay £16,094 costs. Mrs Anne-Lise McDonald, in a joint prosecution for the Environment Agency and Lincolnshire County Council as Waste Planning Authority, said the company had a permit to run a waste transfer station issued in March 2012. Between then and 2014 investigating officers made many visits to the site where they found between 13 and 17 times as much waste as permitted with wastes also exceeding the permitted height limit. She said: Dixon knew the limits and failed to reduce the amount kept at the site. He even allowed more waste to be accepted, compounding the problem. Company in liquidation She told the court that Dixon blamed lack of finances as the reason for his actions. The company has since gone into liquidation. Mrs McDonald said that in April 2013 the county council served 2 enforcement notices and 2 breach of condition notices and in December 2013 the Environment Agency revoked the permit but more waste was brought in. The largest pile and the one which caused the officers the most concern was a very large pile of mixed waste akin to landfill waste but without the precautions that a legitimate landfill site would have in place. The waste was decomposing causing black stagnant liquid to leach out of the waste, bad odours, litter and an increase in flies. The excessive height of the wastes were also harmful to visual amenity. On 6 August 2013 officers noted that the large pile was emitting puffs of smoke and charred remains were noted indicating that the waste was or had been burning and the fire service was called. They recommended splitting the waste into 3 piles to create fire breaks. Methane On 18 December 2013 methane was detected coming from the waste and water samples taken from ditches leading to a surface water drain and then the River Witham had high levels of ammonia. In mitigation for Dixon, Mr Cramner-Brown said, Dixon was trying to save the family business from failing and took his eye off the ball. After the hearing investigating officer Peter Stark said: Dixon and his company were given every opportunity to comply with their permit and planning conditions and operate a business legitimately. He provided assurances that action would be taken to remove waste from the site and activities would be compliant with the waste regulations, these were hollow promises and his legacy to the City of Lincoln will be remembered for the wrong reasons. The Environment Agency and Lincolnshire County Council will not tolerate poor compliance and a disregard for the regulations, planning conditions and the environment. Working together we will continue to use all our powers to ensure the environment and communities are protected and legitimate businesses can operate without unfair competition. Note: Dixon was sentenced to 12 months in prison, suspended for 2 years and 200 hours unpaid work on each of 2 Environment Agency charges to run concurrently. There was no separate penalty for the Lincolnshire County Council offences."
/government/news/working-to-prepare-north-east-communities-for-winter,"The Environment Agency has spent £4million in the North East repairing and improving flood defences helping communities prepare for winter Working to prepare North East communities for winter  Environment Agency Environment Agency staff and contractors have been working around the clock to help prepare hundreds of homes across the North East for winter. Flood risk teams across the North East have carried out checks of all flood defences and £4 million has been spent on repairs and improvement work. Areas benefiting from this work include Blyth, Hexham, Spring Gardens Dam at South Church, Skinningrove, Teesside Park, Port Clarence and Yarm. Last winter was the wettest on record and in early December a rare combination of events resulted in a significant tidal surge that affected many coastal areas. This caused significant damage to a 50 metre section of flood banks south of Greatham Creek in Stockton. Emergency repair work was carried out to protect major industry and local infrastructure, and since then, permanent improvements have been made to reduce the risk of future damage. At Port Clarence in Stockton, where 30 properties were flooded during the tidal surge, the Environment Agency has carried out some flood bank repair work ahead of the flood scheme currently being developed for this community. Flood risk manager Phil Welton said: October to January are generally the wettest months of the year, meaning that winter is a time when there is a greater risk of flooding. While we have been working hard to repair and improve our flood defences across the north east, we always urge the public to be prepared as we can never prevent flooding completely.” Here’s the simple steps people can take: Check if your property is at risk of flooding Sign up for a free flood warning (where available) Know what to do when flooding does happen You can do all this by visiting the Floods Destroy website or calling Floodline on 0345 988 1188."

/government/news/illegal-anglers-netted-in-durham-operation,"7 anglers banned following undercover operation Illegal anglers netted in Durham operation  Environment Agency 7 north east anglers have been banned from fishing following an undercover operation to crack down on illegal fishing methods. The men were caught following a joint operation between the Environment Agency and Durham Police on a stretch of the River Wear. Between April and November this year, magistrates in County Durham imposed a range of penalties on those caught in the operation, including banning defendants from holding rod licences for between 12 months and 2 years, after they pleaded guilty to offences under the Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries Act. Thousands of pounds worth of fishing equipment was also ordered to be destroyed after being confiscated. The court heard that enforcement officers carried out undercover night-time surveillance which caught a number of men fishing illegally using a method called “stroke hauling”. They were using a hook which impales the fish’s body or head. If the fish had managed to escape the hook, it could have left them susceptible to diseases and they may have even died before reaching their spawning grounds. Environment Agency Fisheries Enforcement Team Leader Kevin Summerson said: The fines, fishing bans and orders for equipment to be destroyed should send out a warning to all those who are considering breaking angling laws – we could be watching you! Poachers are not just taking 1 or 2 fish. They are frequently taking large numbers that are often sold on for profit. The methods they use can have a dramatic affect on wildlife and cause serious damage to already threatened fish stocks.

Environment Agency staff will also be on-hand for question and answer sessions in Horncastle (Monday 10:30am-4pm, Thursday 10am-3pm and Saturday 11am-1pm) and in Louth (Monday 11am-5pm, Thursday 1pm-6pm and Saturday 10am-12pm). Planning The schemes are set to be submitted for planning permission in March. The £8.1million Horncastle scheme will see a flood storage reservoir – or washland – built to reduce flood risk from the River Bain. The £6.5million Louth scheme will create two reservoirs outside the town to reduce risk from the River Lud. The proposed Horncastle and Louth washlands will include new earth embankments and automatic control structures. The control structures would manage water levels through the towns by gradually closing as river flows increase. This would maintain a constant flow through the towns until water levels begin to fall, allowing the control sluice to gradually open and the washland to empty. Andrew Barron, Flood and Coastal Risk Management Senior Advisor at Environment Agency, said: We are making good progress with these important and long-awaited schemes and are busy preparing to submit planning applications to make them a reality. They have been developed through a strong partnership with the county council, town and district councils and internal drainage boards and we now want to give people the chance to see our plans. We would therefore encourage as many people as possible to visit their local library and find out more about what we are doing to reduce flood risk to their homes and businesses.” Andrew added: The Horncastle and Louth schemes would reduce flood risk from the rivers Bain and Lud but it is still important for people to recognise that flooding cannot always be prevented and may come from sources other than the river. We encourage people to make sure they are signed up to receive Environment Agency Flood Warnings which provide advance notice when river flooding is expected.” People can get more information, check their flood risk or to sign up to receive Environment Agency flood warnings by logging on to https://www.gov.uk/floodsdestroy or by calling the 24-hour Floodline Warnings Direct service on 0345 988 1188 or 0845 988 1188.

Two men prosecuted for illegal fishing in Kendal, Cumbria  Environment Agency Simon Lenihan of Burland Grove, Kendal, and Thomas Eland of Wildman Street, Kendal, were caught fishing with a rod and line from Busher Walk, River Kent, Kendal, by an Environment Agency water bailiff. It was noticed that they were using lures. In this location anglers are not permitted to use lures or any weighted device because there is a byelaw in place to protect fish that are vulnerable to capture by foul hooking. There are 2 information signs at this location advising anglers of this. Mr Lenihan and Mr Eland both stated they had not read the signs. In addition to this Mr Lenihan was also found to be fishing without a valid rod licence. Lee Preston, from the Environment Agency said: “This prosecution should act as a warning to anglers who think it’s ok to fish without a licence and in a way that harms fish stocks for other anglers. Fish, including migrating salmon, in this location of the River Kent are protected because if a fish gets ‘foul hooked’ with weighted hooks or lures this can cause physical damage and distress. ‘Foul hooking’ also can result in reduced mobility to migrate up river, secondary infection, and often death of the fish. We work with the police, fishery owners and others to detect, deter and enforce against illegal fishing. The money generated by rod licence sales is ploughed back in to protecting fish stocks and improving the local environment. At only £27 for a non migratory licence, £72 for a migratory licence, and £5 for under 16s, it is an affordable hobby that can be enjoyed by the whole family.” Simon Lenihan was fined £400 for fishing without a licence and £100 for fishing in prohibited area.

Work starts on second phase of Leighton Buzzard flood defence scheme  Environment Agency A ground-breaking ceremony took place today (Fri 6) marking the start of the second phase of work to help reduce the risk of flooding to properties in Leighton Buzzard’s Carina Drive. The ground was broken by Andrew Selous, MP for South West Bedfordshire, Cllr Brian Spurr Executive Member for Sustainable Communities at Central Bedfordshire Council and Paul Burrows, Flood and Coastal Risk Manager for the Environment Agency. Working in partnership with Central Bedfordshire Council, the Environment Agency started work to improve flood protection to properties in Carina Drive adjacent to the Clipstone Brook. 29 properties will benefit from the project. Flood risk will be reduced from a 1 in 25 chance of flooding in any given year to less than a 1 in 100 year chance. Paul Burrows, Flood and Coastal Risk Manager for the Environment Agency, said: The works planned are a significant achievement and a testimony to the hard work and commitment of all involved to find an affordable project for the town. This kind of partnership approach between Authorities is an important way to reduce flood risk to local communities. Councillor Brian Spurr, Executive Member for Sustainable Communities at Central Bedfordshire Council, said: This is great news for residents in Carina Drive who have been threatened by flooding for many years. We will continue to work together with the Environment Agency to manage risk in the town. I would also like to remind landowners adjacent to the watercourse that as riparian owners, they have a duty to ensure that the brook flows without obstruction. Central Bedfordshire Council staff carried out the first phase of the work in December 2014. This involved tree pollarding and cutting back vegetation ahead of site inspections and surveys. The Environment Agency, Central Bedfordshire Council and Leighton Linslade Town Council were keen to see the local flooding problems reduced. This second phase of the work is expected to cost £65,000 and will include widening the brook channel, clearing vegetation from the channel, lowering a small section of ground on the Carina Drive side of the brook to redirect floodwater away from homes. It will also include the building of a small flood bank to defend homes. The costs will be met by contributions from both Central Bedfordshire Council and Local Levy. Local Levy is a local flood risk funding source raised and allocated by the Anglian (Central) Regional Flood and Coastal Committee. Central Bedfordshire Council and the Environment Agency have been working together for many years to manage flood risk in the town and will continue to investigate ways of managing flood risk in the town."

Key elements of the contract include: providing expert advice to clubs and fishery owners on how to identify and secure additional funding; improving fisheries’ facilities for anglers; encouraging take-up among junior anglers and in so doing address the recent decline in this age group; retaining and recruiting more anglers to participate in fishing; developing the volunteer bailiff scheme; and working with enforcement partners and fishery owners to clamp down on rural crime and poaching. Sarah Chare, Environment Agency head of fisheries, biodiversity and geomorphology, said: “These are challenging yet exciting times. Protecting and recovering income to fund our fisheries service is one of our highest priorities. We received more than £21.5 million from rod licence sales last year. But we want to see this figure grow and new people picking up a rod. “Our goal is for angling to be recognised for its role in improving the nation’s health and wellbeing, increasing educational attainment and reducing crime and anti-social behaviour. We look forward to receiving applications for this ambitious contract.” The contract, to deliver the broad aims of the ‘National Angling Strategy’, will run for up to 4 years and is currently worth £600,000 per year, although the value of the future contract may increase over time. Advertised through the Official Journal of the European Union, interested organisations have until 9 March 2015 to express an interest. These applicants will then be asked to complete a pre-qualification form to ensure they are suitable to be formally invited to tender for the work. It is expected the new contract will be in place with the successful organisation(s) by July. Currently this work is being carried out by The Angling Trust.

/government/news/boaters-urged-to-renew-their-registrations-or-face-prosecution,"Boaters on the River Thames are being urged to renew their registrations or face prosecution. Boaters urged to renew their registrations or face prosecution.  Environment Agency The reminder comes after an early crackdown in recent weeks on evasion of 2015 annual registration fees along the non-tidal River Thames. The Environment Agency alongside the Metropolitan and Surrey Police and Kingston & London Borough of Richmond upon Thames enforcement officers served nearly 100 enforcement notices in a multi-agency operation which targeted Kingston upon Thames then Whitchurch and Purley. Nick McKie-Smith Waterways Operations Manager for the Environment Agency said: All boats kept on the river must display a valid annual registration plate at all times. We are turning the heat up early on annual registration. Why risk prosecution and a possible criminal conviction? If your annual 2015 boat registration fee is still due, register or remove your boat from the river. The income raised from boat registration fees helps to pay for the upkeep of the entire non-tidal navigation between Teddington and Lechlade, a length of 144 miles, including 45 locks. The Thames is the oldest and most famous public navigation in the world, and we need every penny of registration income that we are due to keep it in the best condition possible. Our crackdown on non-registration will continue throughout the boating season. Ensuring public safety is also another reason for regulation and enforcement. Waterways staff undertake registration checks and enforcement out on the river and at lock-sides to ensure that boats hold the additional legal requirements for a valid boat safety certificate and a minimum third party insurance policy. Nick McKie-Smith added: Just like a car, a boat needs to be licensed, insured and have the boat-equivalent of an MOT which is a valid Boat Safety Certificate or ‘BSC’ - before it can be kept on the river. This is to minimise the risks of accidents such as boat fires, explosions, carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide poisoning onboard and polluting substances entering the water and harming the environment. We want to ensure all our customers to enjoy the river as a safe environment. Ends Notes to Editor: For more information visit River Thames boat registration and applications forms .

Kevin Abbott, Flood and Coastal Risk Management (FCRM) Advisor at the Environment Agency, said: Replacing the damaged sea wall will reduce flood risk to local homes and businesses and will support the resort’s tourism industry, benefitting residents and visitors alike. This work has been planned with public safety in mind, and while some disruption will be unavoidable, we will do our best to minimise this – for example, by pausing construction during the busy holiday season. People familiar with the area will notice that we’ve already been on-site during the initial phase of the work, and we’ve made sure the promenade will still be accessible during the work as the new sea wall will be constructed behind the old one. Initial work was completed at the end of last year to clear the area of sand, which had built up over the years, to investigate for weak points in the sea defence, and to identify any buried services such as electricity supply cables. The designs have now been finalised and construction of the new wall will begin this month. Work will pause during the Easter and May bank holidays, as well as the busy summer period from June to September, to avoid disruption. Construction will restart in September and is expected to finish before Christmas. Improvements to the promenade, which will double its width and install 140m of seating along its 300m length, have been funded by East Lindsey District Council."
/guidance/rye-harbour-passage-pilot-and-mooring-information-for-boaters,"Navigation, passage planning, pilotage service and mooring details for boaters using Rye Harbour. Rye harbour: passage, pilot and mooring information for boaters Boating Environment Agency Navigation and passage planning The port of Rye is a fully operational commercial harbour with a large fishing and leisure fleet. There are a number of navigation aids in place to assist you. Regulation of vessels underway The International Regulations for Preventing Collisions At Sea operate throughout the harbour. Particular attention must be given to keeping a good lookout, especially astern. A maximum speed limit of 6 knots is enforced throughout the harbour and boats should manoeuvre at dead slow when passing moored boats. VHF radio channels Boats fitted with VHF radio are advised to monitor VHF channel 14 whilst manoeuvring in the harbour or its approaches. Rye Harbour VHF channel 14 Lydd firing range VHF channel 73 or 13 East Pier foghorn One short blast every 7 seconds. International Port Traffic Signals International Port Traffic Signals are regularly operated in the harbour. You must comply with these signals when they’re switched on. They’re located on the east pier and three quarters of a mile (1km) inland, near the Harbour Master’s office. These are only switched on when there are commercial traffic movements. When a cargo vessel is being piloted in the harbour, lights will show on the signal masts by the harbour office, and amber lights will flash on the harbour office roof. All vessels must keep clear of the entrance and the main channel during this time. Contact Rye Harbour radio (VHF channel14), before entering the harbour. Navigating the harbour Navigating Rye Bay (Admiralty Charts Nos. 2451 536 1991) In strong on-shore winds, the seas in Rye Bay can be very rough, often breaking well off-shore. Take care when you approach the harbour entrance in on-shore winds greater than force 6. If you approach from the west, keep at least 2 miles off-shore, in a depth of not less than 6 metres until Rye Fairway Buoy is sighted (Spherical R.W.Fl every 10 sec), position 50 54 04N 00048 02E-149 degrees true X 1.8 nautical miles from the harbour entrance. There are numerous anchored gill nets in the bay. These are usually marked at each end by dan buoys and have a minimum depth of water over them of 2 metres. Lydd firing range The Ministry of Defence operate the Lydd Firing Range to the east of Rye Harbour, extending 3 miles along the coast with prohibited areas to seaward varying in distance from 1.5 nautical miles to 2.5 nautical miles. When firing is taking place there are range safety patrol boats to give advice to mariners (VHF channel 73 or 13). Firing times can be obtained from the Harbour Master’s office (telephone 01797 225225). Rye harbour approaches The easiest approach to the entrance is from the Fairway Buoy, on a rhumb line course of 329 true, keeping the port and starboard entrance markers wide open. The harbour entrance is 42 metres wide and is marked by a red painted tripod beacon (flashes red every 8 secs) 30 metres seaward of the West Groyne, approximate position 50 55 55n 000 46’65E. Harbour entrance The west side is marked by a red tripod beacon. The light flashes red every 8 seconds positioned 30 metres seaward of the West Groyne. Don’t attempt to pass between the tripod and the West Groyne. There may be strong eddies inside the West Groyne during the flood stream and mariners should be prepared to apply correcting helm (usually to starboard) when passing the West Groyne. The East Pier, which is submerged at high water springs, is a further 240 metres inland. It has a green square steel structure with a green board at the top which flashes white every 15 seconds. The seaward face of the green board is illuminated at night. The East Pier also has 4 unlit starboard hand beacons. Main Channel Once inside the piers there is good shelter in all conditions. The channel narrows to 30 metres and runs straight (329 true) for half a mile with Rye Harbour village on the west bank and the Harbour master’s office on the east bank. Attention must be paid to the west training wall which submerges at high water but is well marked by port hand beacons and lights. The east training wall is sloping and is marked by starboard hand beacons and lights. The River Rother has a maximum flood stream of 5 knots on spring tides and reaches this maximum velocity between high water and 1 hour. All new arrivals must stop at the visitor’s jetty and report to the harbour office for berthing instructions and further navigation information. Rye Harbour dries out completely at low tide. Boats should not approach the harbour more than 2 hours before high water and more than 3 hours after high water. Boaters without good local knowledge wishing to berth in the soft mud near the town of Rye should not arrive at the entrance to the harbour later than 1 hour after high water. Pilotage service Pilotage is compulsory for all ships over 30 metres long navigating in any part of the Harbour of Rye. Requests for specific pilotage services must be made to the Harbour Master, with 24 hours notice. Less notice may be accepted in specific circumstances. Any ship navigating to the Harbour of Rye and liable to pilotage in the harbour should establish radio contact with the Harbour Master to notify his position when no more than 5 and no less than 2 nautical miles from the No. 2 red light tripod beacon. Ships should not proceed closer without the Harbour Master’s direction. Any ship navigating to or from the harbour and liable to pilotage in the harbour should board or land a pilot no less than 1 nautical mile from No. 2 red light tripod beacon.

/government/news/environment-agency-unveils-new-rod-licence-images-to-promote-legal-fishing,"The Environment Agency unveils new designs by renowned angling and wildlife artist, David Miller for this year’s rod licences  Environment Agency unveils new rod licence images to promote legal fishing  Environment Agency Designed by renowned angling and wildlife artist, David Miller, the new rod licences go on sale today (Monday 2 March). The image on this year’s coarse fishing rod licence is a crucian carp (Carassius carassius) and the non-coarse is a salmon (Salmo salar). Last year David’s artwork featured on a range of sustainable fish stamps for the Royal Mail. Sarah Chare, head of fisheries at the Environment Agency, said: “Rod licence income is used to protect and improve fish stocks and fisheries for the benefit of anglers. We want more people to go fishing this year and everyone who does will need one of these licences. We’re delighted to see David’s stunning designs yet again which promote the beauty of our natural environment and encourage people to give fishing a go.” David Miller, the artist who designed the rod licence, said: “Designing this year’s rod licence combines 2 of my passions: fishing and art. The Environment Agency does a fantastic job and I’m proud to be supporting rod licence sales with my artwork.” At £27 for coarse fishing and non-migratory trout, or £72 to also fish for salmon and sea trout, the annual licence is great value for money. There are flexible options to choose from too: a 1-day or 8-day licence or the full season. There are also junior and concession options. You can buy a rod licence online from the Post Office here , at your local Post Office or by phoning 0344 800 5386. Buying a rod licence online from the Post Office website is easy, and saves both time and administration costs, meaning that more of the income can be spent on improving fish stocks and fishing. Always ensure that you buy direct from the Post Office because there are some unofficial websites which charge a handling fee. Anyone fishing illegally is cheating other licence paying anglers, can expect to be prosecuted and face a substantial fine. In 2013/ 2014 the Environment Agency checked 80,000 rod licences and prosecuted 2,795 anglers for fishing without a licence."

This follows a nationwide Environment Agency probe into the illegal dumping of potentially hazardous waste at illegal waste sites in Bristol, Scunthorpe and Newark in Nottinghamshire. The investigation is also looking at links to an abandoned waste transfer site in Orpington run by operators Waste4Fuel. More than 40 Environment Agency investigators, supported by Humberside, Nottinghamshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Police, swooped on suspects home addresses and the sites as part of Operation Encore. Environment Agency crime staff from across England, including a number in specialist breathing apparatus, have been brought in to support the operation due to its large scale. The police were deployed to support with arrests, access properties and assist with collecting evidence. The Home Office Immigration Enforcement and Social Services were also involved as part of this multi-agency operation, due to a suspected number of illegal workers at the sites. The 6 people arrested have all been released on conditional bail pending further enquiries. The investigation is ongoing and expected to take many more months to complete. Andy Higham, Head of the Environment Agency’s National Investigation Team, said: The Environment Agency will relentlessly target organised criminals who risk damaging health, livelihoods and the environment by trading in illegal and hazardous waste for criminal gain. Following a covert Environment Agency investigation we have worked with the police to arrest these suspects and secure evidence. Our enquiries will continue to probe the full extent of suspected offending. We take waste crime extremely seriously. This is a live and complex investigation, anyone with further information should contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111. Resource Management Minister Dan Rogerson said: Waste crime causes problems for local communities, undermines legitimate businesses and costs taxpayers. While it is not appropriate to comment on these arrests, we support the Environment Agency in taking a robust approach to tackle crime."

Angler fined for public order offence in Oxfordshire  Environment Agency An angler has been ordered to pay £685 after pleading guilty to abusive and threatening behaviour against two Environment Agency Fisheries Enforcement Officers at a popular Oxfordshire fishing spot. Edward O’Hara from Woolman Road in Blackpool appeared before Banbury Magistrates Court on 11 March. The court heard how during a routine licence patrol on Oxlease Lake back in 2012, Mr O’Hara was fishing with a group of fellow anglers, when the fisheries enforcement officers approached the men as part of a routine rod licence check. The defendant quickly became aggressive when the officers inspected his licence. The police arrived on the scene after other members of the group started being obstructive and abusive to the Environment Agency staff. The magistrates warned Mr O’Hara about his future behaviour and fined him £395 for the Section 4 Public Order offence, £200 costs, £40 Victim Surcharge and £50 compensation to one of the Environment Agency Fisheries Officers. The defendant apologised to the magistrates for his behaviour and to both officers saying that he had been fishing for 20 years and thought the Environment Agency did a good job but just lost it on that day. The Fisheries Enforcement Officer said: I hope this sends a very strong message to anglers that Fishery Enforcement Officers will not put up with abusive and threatening behaviour and that the courts take a very serious view of it. He added: most anglers are a pleasure to meet but there is still a small minority who are abusive and obstructive which is really disappointing. As Enforcement Officers our job is to enforce fishery bylaws and protect rod licence income - which all gets invested back into fishing and fisheries. Notes to Editors Annual licences run from 1 April to 31 March. You can buy a licence: online, in person or by phone at the Post Office by yearly direct debit with the Environment Agency Buy a fishing licence online Offences: Used threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour causing that person to believe that immediate unlawful violence will be used against him.

/government/news/boater-to-pay-4567,"Boater to pay £4,567 for creating wrong sort of rock and roll at Henley music festival. Boater to pay £4,567  Environment Agency An inconsiderate boater whose reckless skippering caused thousands of pounds of damage to other vessels during last year’s Henley Festival was hit in his own pocket today, Monday 16 March, at Oxford Magistrates Court. Malcolm Howell, 29, of no fixed abode, pleaded guilty to failing to navigate his boat ‘Attention Seeker’ at a safe speed and with due care and caution. He was fined £400, and ordered to pay costs of £3,515, compensation of £612 and a victim surcharge of £40 - £4,567 in total. In the early hours of Sunday 13 July 2014, Mr Howell’s high speed manoeuvrings created excessive wash, causing boats moored along this normally tranquil stretch of the River Thames to lift, rock and violently roll from side to side, sending cabin contents crashing to the floor, waking sleeping occupants and ripping some boats from their moorings. One boater described the incident as ‘terrifying’; another labelled Mr Howell’s antics as ‘one of the most irresponsible skippering manoeuvres I have ever seen.’ Witnesses described how the incident started with Mr Howell demanding that festival security officers order him a water taxi to take him to his boat as it was moored to a boom in the middle of the river, and could not be boarded from the bank. On being told that the water taxi service was no longer running, Mr Howell became verbally abusive, swearing at the security officers and members of the public. His companion then decided to swim out the boat and retrieve one if its mooring lines which they used to pull the boat closer to the bank, enabling them to get on board. Once on board Mr Howell started the engine and immediately set off at high speed, careering first into the boom in the river and then racing downstream in the dark without the boat’s navigation lights on, presenting a significant hazard to any other traffic on the river. The powerful wash generated by the rapid movement of ‘Attention Seeker’ through the water resulted in many of the other boats moored along the Thames, whose owners had chosen to travel to the festival site by river, being ‘thrown all over the place’ according to one witness. Another stated that the wash was so violent it took 15 minutes for the river to calm down. Nick McKie-Smith, Waterways Operations Manager said “As the navigation authority for the non-tidal Thames, we’re very keen on people using their boats to travel to events such as Henley Festival. “We love to see the river filled with people enjoying everything that this fabulous waterway has to offer. But we expect all river users to behave with consideration for others and to comply with the rules that are there to prevent situations that could see damage to property and harm to people, including navigating their boat no faster than 8 kilometres or 5 miles per hour - basically at no more than a brisk walking pace.” The Environment Agency carries out regular speed and wash checks along the river, and takes appropriate enforcement action against anyone not obeying the rules. But if incidents occur when their officers are not present, a successful prosecution relies on witnesses being prepared to make formal statements that could be used in court, and to provide evidence such as photos or footage. Nick McKie-Smith, Waterways Operations Manager continued, “We do receive a small but steady stream of complaints about inappropriate behaviour on the Thames, and would always encourage people to report it to us. “We respond to and investigate as many reports as we can, but unless people are prepared to make formal statements, ideally backed up with evidence, then taking it further can be difficult. So we’re very grateful to everyone who has helped us bring Mr Howell to book on this occasion.” ENDS Notes to editors Mr Howell was prosecuted under Byelaw 26 of the Thames Navigation Licensing and General Byelaws 1993 for ‘failing to navigate the vessel at all times at a safe speed and with due care and caution to prevent avoidable damage or unreasonable disturbance to persons, other vessels or moorings or the river banks and in such manner as to show reasonable consideration for all persons and property in, upon or about the Thames or the banks or towpaths thereof or any land of the Authority’. Anyone witnessing boats travelling at high speed, creating excessive wash or any other form of anti-social behaviour on the non-tidal River Thames should report it to the Environment Agency’s incident hotline 0800 80 70 60.

A new vision  for the Denver Sluice Complex  Environment Agency Local people are invited to an event to find out more about plans to improve the Denver Complex as a visitor destination. An exhibition will be held in the Environment Agency office at the Denver Complex on Thursday 19 March. Members of the public are invited to drop in between 2pm and 7pm to hear about proposals to improve the site for visitors. Denver Sluice is a significant flood risk management structure which has protected the people of the Fens and their property from flooding for 5 centuries. It is also now important for navigation and has a role supplying water to 3 public water supply reservoirs in Essex. The study and development of proposals is being led by Richard Glen Associates, who have been working with partners to come up with ideas for how the site could be improved for visitors. The plan will also identify various ways of increasing the awareness and understanding of flood risk and the wider environment. Ian Bliss, Waterways Partnerships Manager for the Environment Agency, said: We would like to encourage as many people as possible to come along to hear about the ideas to improve the Denver Complex for visitors; we will be on hand to answer any questions and are keen to get views and ideas to help develop the proposals Ideas that have been put forward so far include: creating a visitor centre, using Denver as base for a variety of water sports, improving moorings and facilities for boaters, creating new wetland habitat and creating better walking, cycling and riding trails. The study will also look at the issue of increased traffic to the Complex by considering more sustainable forms of transport such as a water taxi link with Downham Market Station and a revised bus route. The Environment Agency manages the site and is a partner in the Ouse Washes Landscape Partnership (OWLP) which is a Heritage Lottery Fund project managed by Cambridgeshire ACRE. The Ouse Washes Landscape Partnership involves working with a wide range of partners to promote the Ouse Washes landscape as a destination while maintaining the uniqueness of this valuable, wildlife rich, working landscape and its cultural heritage.

/government/news/quarter-of-a-million-fish-rescued-in-norfolk-broads,"Two days of intensive fish netting has saved the lives of nearly a quarter of a million fish at Hickling in the Norfolk Broads. Quarter of a million fish rescued in Norfolk Broads  Environment Agency Environment Agency fisheries teams worked round the clock to rescue and relocate approximately 230,000 fish thought to be fleeing from the toxic effects of a Prymnesium alagal bloom. The fish shoaled in a shallow ‘haven’ away from the effects of the spreading bloom but were in danger of seriously depleting the dissolved oxygen levels and needed to be relocated quickly. Helped by volunteers from the Whispering Reeds boatyard - where the fish had gathered - and a local angling rep, Environment Agency teams moved the fish in tanks to the relative safety of the boatyard at Potter Heigham from where they could then swim freely into the rivers. Fleeing from toxic Prymnesium Stephen Lane, fisheries technical specialist at the Environment Agency, said: Thanks to everyone who helped. It was a very effective operation. We are especially grateful to the Whispering Reeds boatyard and Herberts Wood boatyard at Potter Heigham for enabling access to the site, and John Currie, an angling volunteer, for his assistance. It was thanks to people who phoned us with their concerns that we were able to save nearly a quarter of a million fish. This is a great example of where rod licence money has been spent on improving fisheries. We would like to remind the angling community if they see any fish in distress or dead fish, to call our hotline on 0800 807060. Scientists from the John Innes Centre were out taking water samples and collecting samples of dead fish - 350 to 400 fish died in the incident – to help with their research into why Prymenesium releases toxins in certain environmental conditions. The situation is continuing to be monitored. The last similar occurrence in Hickling Broad was in 2012 when 35,000 fish were rescued and relocated. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt8Gd-ruB7s&feature=youtu.be https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfYwGMJIGg8&feature=youtu.be An annual rod licence, available now for the 2015/16 season, remains at 2010 prices, costing £27 for non-migratory trout and coarse fish or £72 for salmon and migratory trout. Concessionary licences, which cost £5, are available to junior anglers (aged 12-16). Anglers under 12 do not require a licence. Anglers over 65 and anyone with a Blue Badge parking concession or in receipt of Disability Living Allowance also pay the concessionary adult rate of £18 (non-migratory trout, coarse fish and eels) and £48 (salmon and migratory trout).

/government/news/anglers-in-devon-and-cornwall-reminded-coarse-fish-close-season-begins,"Anglers across Devon and Cornwall are being reminded that fishing for coarse fish in rivers is off limits between 14 March and 16 June. Anglers in Devon and Cornwall reminded: coarse fish close season begins  Environment Agency The Environment Agency is warning those who fish in rivers that the coarse fishing ‘close season’ is in place and anyone caught fishing illegally can expect to be prosecuted and face a substantial fine. Judy Proctor for the Environment Agency said: The river close season for coarse fish is there for a good reason. By preventing coarse fishing for 3 months, between 14 March and 16 June, it allows for an uninterrupted spawning period, which increases breeding success, in addition to providing wider environmental benefits. Environment Agency enforcement teams will be carrying out regular patrols of waters during the close season and anyone found fishing illegally may face prosecution and a hefty fine. However, coarse fishing is still allowed on many stillwaters and canals, depending on landowner agreement, though a valid rod licence is still required. Contact your local Environment Agency office for a list of stillwaters and canals within the specified Sites of Special Scientific Interest where the statutory close season still applies. Byelaws for your area can be found at: www.gov.uk/freshwater-rod-fishing-rules/overview At £27 for coarse fishing and non-migratory trout, or £72 to also fish for salmon and sea trout, the annual licence is great value for money. There are flexible options to choose from too: a 1 or 8 day licence or the full season. There are also junior and concession options. You can buy a rod licence online from the Post Office here , at your local Post Office or by phoning 0344 800 5386. Buying a rod licence online from the Post Office website is easy, and saves both time and administration costs, meaning that more of the income can be spent on improving fish stocks and fishing. Always ensure that you buy direct from the Post Office because there are some unofficial websites which charge a handling fee. Anyone fishing illegally is cheating other licence paying anglers, can expect to be prosecuted and face a substantial fine. In 2013/ 2014 the Environment Agency checked 80,000 rod licences and prosecuted 2,795 anglers for fishing without a licence. The money raised through the sales of rod licences is re-invested and enables the Environment Agency to improve all fisheries, including rivers for anglers. Officers routinely undertake licence checks and anyone with information about illegal fishing activities is urged to contact the Environment Agency’s incident hotline on 0800 80 70 60 or anonymously to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

/government/news/multi-agency-clamp-down-on-illegal-scrap-metal-operators-in-boston,"Businesses in Boston have been visited by authorities in a clamp-down on illegal vehicle dismantlers and unlicensed scrap metal dealers. Multi-agency clamp down on illegal scrap metal operators in Boston  Environment Agency The Environment Agency worked with Boston Borough Council, Lincolnshire County Council and Lincolnshire Police on 26 March to put a stop to illegal activity - and keep a level playing field for legitimate businesses to operate in the waste vehicle dismantling sector. Officers visited illegal vehicle dismantlers and unlicensed scrap metal dealers and carriers to provide them with advice and guidance. Commercial vehicle dismantling and scrap metal businesses need permits to operate, both from the Environment Agency and other authorities. When a vehicle has reached the end of its useful life, it must be scrapped at an authorised treatment facility. This is usually free, however, the licensed facilities are allowed to charge for handling and disposing of vehicles missing essential parts. If a vehicle has been damaged and written–off by an insurance company, they’ll usually dispose of it. Environment Agency Enforcement Officer Peter Stark said: “We want the industry to operate on equal terms and we receive a tremendous amount of support from legitimate collectors and yards. We will continue to engage with illegal operators, provide advice to those who want to comply, and stop those who flout the regulations. “We work to ensure no harm comes to people and the environment from these sites treating waste vehicles and scrap metal.” If you sell your scrap to a collector or yard in the Boston area, please ask to see their scrap metal licence issued by Boston Borough Council, and make sure you receive payment by cheque or bank transfer, rather than cash. If you want to dispose of your old vehicle, ensure it is taken to a permitted site where it can be fully de-polluted without the risk of harming the environment. For further information on scrap metal dealers’ licences in Boston, contact Boston Borough Council on 01205 314242.

/government/news/lincoln-man-guilty-of-dumping-waste-near-leicestershire-river,"Waste dumped near a protected site of Special Scientific Interest and the River Mease led to prosecution and a fine. Lincoln man guilty of dumping waste near Leicestershire river  Environment Agency On 26 March 2015, Frank Nicklinson, 39, from Lincoln pleaded guilty at Leicester Magistrates Court to two offences relating to the illegal transportation and dumping of controlled waste on land at Lounge Colliery, Ashby Road, Ashby de la Zouch on 5 August 2014. Mr Nicklinson received a fine of £660, was ordered to pay costs of £1700 and a victim surcharge of £66. On 5 August 2014 an on-duty police officer witnessed Mr Nicklinson and a colleague driving onto the Lounge Colliery site in Ashby de la Zouch and depositing construction and demolition waste from a trailer onto the land without permission and without a valid waste carrier’s licence. The Lounge Colliery site is within the catchment area of the River Mease which is a Site of Special Scientific Interest. The river supports nationally significant populations of two fish species, Bullhead and Spined Loach. The main watercourse within the colliery feeds into the River Mease via a brook and therefore any contaminants coming from the waste have a direct link to the river. The River Mease is classed as being in an unfavourable condition due to poor water quality. In addition, the colliery itself is home to a large, regionally significant, population of great crested newts which are a protected species. Speaking after the case, an Environment Agency officer involved with the investigation said: The site where the waste was tipped is within the catchment area of the River Mease which could pose serious threat to the natural habitat. The accumulation of waste at the site has also sparked recent arson attacks which again can have significant environmental and economic impact. The crime was committed for financial gain and has contributed towards significant cleanup costs. This prosecution demonstrates that we take cases such as this very seriously and will not hesitate to prosecute if necessary, to protect the environment and local communities."

To make the most efficient use of our 10-year work programme, we need to carry out more detailed investigations into the condition of some of these defences. Investigating tidal defences TEAM2100 is carrying out detailed engineering and structural investigations into the condition of tidal flood defences in London and the Thames estuary. This work began in March 2015 and will be largely complete by March 2016. The defences include the Thames Barrier and 350 kilometres of flood walls and embankments, smaller barriers, pumping stations and flood gates. This system of defences protects 1.25 million people and £200 billion worth of property. Many of the defences are over 30 years old, and in some cases over 100 years old. Our investigations will provide us with information about the condition of individual defences and about the system as a whole. What we learn from these investigations will inform our 10-year work programme of refurbishment and replacement, and our management of the system of defences over the next 100 years.

/government/news/second-hand-store-owner-burned-waste-illegally-in-county-durham,"A second hand shop owner pleads guilty to illegally burning waste following Environment Agency investigation Second hand store owner burned waste illegally in County Durham  Environment Agency A second hand shop owner claiming he was supplying furniture to TV show ‘Inspector George Gently’ broke the law by storing items and burning them at a site in County Durham. Peterlee Magistrates Court heard that one fire at the site – at South Moor, Stanley - led to a neighbour having to seek medical treatment for asthma and it also affected the egg-laying ability of his chickens. Christopher Williams, 56, of Acton Dene in Stanley, pleaded guilty to a charge of illegally storing and incinerating waste between 1 December 2013 and 30 April 2014, following an investigation by the Environment Agency. He pleaded guilty when he appeared at the court on Friday 8 May, and was sentenced to 18 weeks in prison, suspended for 12 months, and ordered to pay £4,000 costs. He was also ordered to pay £400 compensation to the owner of the land for waste clearance and £150 to a neighbour who suffered health problems from the effects of smoke. It is against the law to store or burn waste material on land not covered by a permit to ensure measures are in place to prevent harm to the environment. The court was told that Williams had permission from the landlord of the site to use a garage and part of the property to store “overspill” from his second hand shop. Williams was seen bringing back items including wood, curtain material, bedroom furniture, plastic, carpets and old computer monitors. He told the local council neighbourhood warden that he was storing items not viable for sale. Concerned about the waste on site and its untidy state, the warden contacted the landlord who paid to have a large quantity of the waste removed at his own expense. Williams later denied the waste belonged to him but was later seen burning material on the premises. Environment Agency investigating officers found the site’s garage was full of mixed waste and discovered an invoice and letter which was traced back to a home owner who had paid Williams £120 to take away her old furniture. Officers served a notice on Williams warning him to stop storing and burning waste. In mitigation he said that some of the furniture seen in the photos was not waste and had been supplied to the producers of Inspector George Gently. Waste crime has a detrimental effect on local communities and the environment and can undermine legitimate businesses.

/government/news/bank-holiday-blitz-on-illegal-angling,"Officers from the Environment Agency will be patrolling north east rivers from the Tees to the Coquet this weekend on the look-out for anglers fishing illegally.  Bank Holiday blitz on illegal angling  Environment Agency Anglers are being reminded that fishing for coarse fish in rivers is off limits until next month and anyone caught fishing illegally can expect to be prosecuted and face a fine. The three-month break – from Sunday 15 March to Monday 15 June – is designed to protect breeding fish. The Environment Agency team will also be ensuring those fishing the many lakes, rivers, ponds and canals where coarse fishing is still allowed have a valid rod licence. And they’ll be on the look-out for those using illegal baits, banned methods of fishing and fishing in prohibited areas – such as that underneath Framwellgate Weir in Durham. The Environment Agency’s Kevin Summerson said: “The close season on our rivers is important to maintain healthy stocks, as it allows fish time to breed and spawn. “During this time fisheries enforcement officers have been carrying out regular patrols of our region’s rivers. “Over this coming Bank Holiday weekend we’ll be out and about making checks to make sure angers aren’t fishing illegally. “With migratory fish now returning to our rivers we’ll be paying particular attention to the prohibited areas below weirs and dams.” It’s a crime to fish without a valid licence and offenders could be fined up to £2,500, have their fishing equipment seized and be banned from fishing. Fishing during the close season, using banned baits and fishing in prohibited areas attracts a fine of up to £50,000. Over the past six weeks Fisheries Enforcement Officers have checked 1,213 licensed anglers with a further 42 reported for unlicensed fishing. Using intelligence they’ve carried out 49 patrols specifically aimed at targeting those who fish during the close season, with 17 byelaw offences detected and dealt with. Kevin added: “All the money from rod licence sales goes straight back into maintaining fisheries so those people who fish without a rod licence are having a direct effect on our work. “It’s unacceptable to fish without first buying a licence, and we’ll continue to work with angling groups and the police to target areas where illegal activity is high.” At £27 for coarse fishing and non-migratory trout, or £72 to also fish for salmon and sea trout, the annual licence is great value for money. There are flexible options to choose from too: a one or eight day licence or the full season. And there are also junior and concession options as well to ensure value for money fishing for the whole family. You can buy a rod licence online from the Post Office, at your local Post Office or by phoning 0870 166 2662, or online . Environment Agency officers routinely carry out licence checks and anyone with information about illegal fishing activities is urged to report it via the Environment Agency’s Incident Hotline on 0800 80 70 60 or anonymously to independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."
/government/news/burton-man-jailed-for-7-months-over-illegal-waste-site,"Defendant had complete disregard for the law and the environment  Burton man jailed for 7 months over illegal waste site  Environment Agency On 30 April 2015, Robert Murphy, 48, of Ravens Way, Burton-upon-Trent Staffordshire was sentenced at Stafford Crown Court to 7 months imprisonment, following a contested Newton Hearing for an offence of operating a waste facility on land off the A38 Eggington near Burton-upon-Trent. Murphy, who did not own the land, continued to operate on the site despite advice and guidance, a stop letter, the changing of the locks to the site entrance, the deployment of CCTV and the deployment of a concrete block by the Environment Agency to prevent access to the land. Over a 15-month period from 3 January 2013 to 28 June 2014, Murphy used the land which belonged to a vulnerable local couple to deposit, store and burn large quantities of mixed waste including metal, wood, electrical items and construction and demolition waste. Murphy did not have permission to use the land near Burton-upon-Trent nor did he have an environmental permit. The land has been left in a state of complete ruin. The court heard from a number of witnesses, one of whom gave evidence behind screens, and HHJ Chambers concluded that an immediate custodial sentence was the only option given the seriousness of the defendant’s actions. Confiscation proceedings under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 have been scheduled for 12 June 2015 to seek compensation for the landowner to pay for some of the clean up costs. Speaking after the case, an Environment Agency officer involved with the investigation said: Throughout the investigations Mr Murphy was given a number of opportunities to stop his illegal activities but continued to show a complete disregard towards the environment, landowners and authority. This prosecution demonstrates that we take cases such as this very seriously and will not hesitate to prosecute if necessary, to protect the environment and local communities."

/government/news/casting-the-net-on-illegal-fishing-in-yorkshire,"Enforcement officers checked 473 anglers across Yorkshire over the Bank Holiday weekend Casting the net on illegal fishing in Yorkshire  Environment Agency Anglers in Yorkshire are being reminded to ensure they abide by national and local byelaws as enforcement officers crack down on illegal fishing. During the Bank Holiday weekend, from 23 to 25 May, Environment Agency fisheries enforcement officers checked 473 anglers at 29 separate locations across Yorkshire using local knowledge and intelligence to catch offenders. During these three days, 56 people were reported for various fisheries offences. Most of these were reported for fishing without a licence. Fishing without a rod licence can result in a fine of up to £2,500. Peter Mischenko, fisheries technical officer at the Environment Agency, said: It is absolutely vital that anglers obey the laws relating to rod licences and the coarse fish close season to protect our fisheries. Money from rod licences goes straight back into trout and freshwater fisheries. People who fish without a rod licence are having a direct effect on the work we can deliver. The close season in our rivers is important to allow the fish time to breed and spawn and so maintain a healthy stock of fish. Without it, our fisheries would be put at risk. We use intelligence gathered previously to indicate the locations where anglers are likely to be fishing illegally, and we concentrated our efforts towards those areas. We shall continue to target those waters where evasion and illegal activity is high and those caught may be prosecuted. At an earlier rod licence ‘blitz’, from 2 to 4 May, Environment Agency fisheries enforcement officers checked 305 anglers at 51 separate locations, and reported 28 offenders. Last year, fisheries enforcement officers checked a total of 7,027 anglers, and 520 anglers were reported for fishing offences. Enforcement officers will be checking anglers again in the coming weeks to cast the net on illegal fishing. Enforcement patrols are carried out annually during the coarse fish close season, which runs from 15 March to 15 June inclusive. Rivers are off limits for coarse fishing during this period, but it is still permitted on many canals and stillwaters, depending on landowner agreement. An annual rod licence costs £27 for coarse fishing and non-migratory trout, or £72 to also fish for salmon and sea trout. There are flexible options to choose from including a 1-day or 8-day licence or the full season. There are also junior and concession options.

/government/news/rod-licence-checks-in-bank-holiday-crackdown-in-the-north-east,"Over 300 rod licences were checked from Teesside to Northumberland in Bank Holiday blitz Rod licence checks in Bank Holiday crackdown in the North East  Environment Agency Officers from the Environment Agency made more than 300 rod licence checks during a bank holiday blitz on anglers fishing illegally in the north east of England. A total of 316 licences were checked at 49 locations from the rivers Tees to the Coquet, with 12 people reported for angling offences. Anglers were reminded that fishing for coarse fish in rivers is off limits until next month. The three-month break – from Sunday 15 March to Monday 15 June – is designed to protect breeding fish. And officers ensured those fishing the many lakes, rivers, ponds and canals where coarse fishing is still allowed had valid rod licences. The Environment Agency’s fisheries enforcement office Kevin Summerson said; “During checks officers focused on the areas where offences have previously been detected to ensure the message about illegal fishing is getting through. “The close season on our rivers is important to maintain healthy stocks, as it allows fish time to breed and spawn.” It’s a crime to fish without a valid licence and offenders could be fined up to £2,500, have their fishing equipment seized and be banned from fishing. Fishing during the close season, using banned baits and fishing in prohibited areas attracts a fine of up to £50,000. Over the past eight weeks fisheries enforcement officers have checked 1,529 licensed anglers with a further 54 reported for unlicensed fishing. Kevin added; “All the money from rod licence sales goes straight back into maintaining fisheries so those people who fish without a rod licence are having a direct effect on our work.” At £27 for coarse fishing and non-migratory trout, or £72 to also fish for salmon and sea trout, the annual licence is great value for money. There are flexible options to choose from too: a one or eight day licence or the full season. There are also junior and concession options as well to ensure value for money fishing for the whole family. You can buy a rod licence online from the Post Office, at your local Post Office or by phoning 0870 166 2662, or online here . Environment Agency officers routinely carry out licence checks and anyone with information about illegal fishing activities is urged to report it via the Environment Agency’s incident hotline on 0800 80 70 60 or anonymously to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."
/government/news/follow-up-visits-made-after-clamp-down-on-illegal-scrap-metal-operators,"Businesses in Boston have been visited by authorities for a follow-up in a clamp down operation on illegal vehicle dismantlers and unlicensed scrap metal dealers. Follow-up visits made after clamp-down on illegal scrap metal operators  Environment Agency The Environment Agency along with Boston Borough Council and Lincolnshire County Council paid a visit to operators in March to inspect and provide advice on how to comply with the law. Commercial vehicle dismantling and scrap metal businesses need permits to operate, both from the Environment Agency and planning authorities. When a vehicle has reached the end of its useful life it must be scrapped at an authorised treatment facility. Environment Agency Enforcement Officer, Peter Stark said: “We are acting on the promise to ensure there is no harm to people and the environment from sites treating waste vehicles and scrap metal.” “We have done follow-up visits to four sites and hand-delivered application forms for environmental permits for breaking and dismantling vehicles. We have given operators final deadlines and will take enforcement action against those that don’t comply. “We will continue to engage with illegal operators, provide advice to those that want to comply and stop those that flout the regulations. “We’d also appeal to the public to inform them of any illegal vehicle dismantlers - reports can be made anonymously via our 0800 807060 incident hotline or to Crimestoppers.” If you are selling your scrap to a collector or yard please ask to see their scrap metal licence, issued by Boston Borough Council, and do not under any circumstances ask for cash; you should be paid by cheque or bank transfer. If you want to dispose of your old vehicle, ensure it is taken to a permitted site where it can be fully de-polluted without the risk of harming the environment. For further information on Scrap Metal Dealers licences in Boston, contact Boston Borough Council on 01205 314242.

Water abstraction: how to make sure your meter is accurate Water Environment Agency In most cases your licence to abstract water will tell you whether you must have a water meter. If you’re not sure, contact the Environment Agency . Where to install your meter Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for where to install your meter. Depending on the conditions of your licence, don’t put it: where you can’t see it where it will get very hot or very cold where vibrations or electrical interference could affect it where it could become corroded right next to a pump on the suction side of a pump near any bends or joins in a pipe near any changes in the width of a pipe near any valves or other parts that change the way that water flows in the pipe where the pipe will only partly fill with water If you’re not sure which of these applies to you, contact the Environment Agency . Check your meter is accurate Your meter must give a reading that is accurate to within 5% of the real amount of water that it’s measuring. For example, if you’re measuring 1,000 litres of water, you’re allowed readings between 950 litres and 1,050 litres. You must check your meter to make sure that it stays accurate. This is called flow checking. You can use either of the following methods: send the meter to a specialist laboratory for testing compare your meter’s readings with those from another meter that you know is accurate If your meter is inaccurate, you must either send it to a specialist laboratory to be adjusted or install a new meter. You must install a temporary meter if you need to carry on abstracting while your meter is away being adjusted. How often to flow check your meter Contact the Environment Agency to find out how often you must flow check your meter. They’ll ask you: what type of meter you have whether you use the meter continuously, intermittently or seasonally whether your water source is clean or contains sand, grit or weeds You’ll have to flow check your meter between once a year and once every 7 years depending on the combination of these factors. Keep records You must keep records of all your flow checks. Include: the date the method you used the results Your meter’s manufacturer and any laboratory that adjusts your meter should send you a certificate that states the accuracy of your meter. You must show your records, the manufacturer’s certificate and any laboratory certificates to an Environment Agency inspector if you’re asked to."

The funding comes from the Environment Agency’s rod licence sales. Building on the success of the first round of funding earlier this year, the fund will again be offering awards of up to £5,000 per project.This time, proposals are invited under two strands of the National Angling Strategy ‘Fishing for Life’ - either ‘getting kids into fishing’ or ‘protection from predation’. The funding comes from the Environment Agency’s rod licence sales and is administered by the Angling Trust. How to apply Eligibility criteria and details about how to apply will be available to view and download from the Angling Trust’s dedicated Fishery Improvement Fund web page from Friday 12 June. Applications should be emailed to reach the Angling Trust by the close of business on Monday 13 July 2015, and successful organisations must be able to spend the award by no later than the end of August. Sarah Chare, head of fisheries at the Environment Agency, said: The Fishery Improvement Fund is just one way we use rod licence money to work with partners to benefit angling. The first phase saw some really good projects given money: from new fish refuges and revitalising disused stretches of river to improving access and creating new angling venues. I’m now looking forward to seeing great results from the second round, especially those which encourage young people to give fishing a go. Mark Lloyd, Chief Executive, Angling Trust said: Angling’s response to the first round was phenomenal and clearly demonstrates the huge demand for improved facilities and habitats at our fishing waters. This time around, we are looking to support two priority areas for anglers: getting more kids into fishing and sustaining their enthusiasm, and protecting fish stocks from predation. If you are interested in applying, or are looking for general tips on finding funding for your club or fishery, please do try and come to our workshops at the end of June. Further information Details of the 17 projects funded in the first round of the Fund can be found on the Angling Trust website For further information please contact Rick Warner, Fishery Improvement Fund Administrator"

Produced by the Angling Trust in partnership with the Environment Agency, Met Office and Post Office, Fishinginfo.co.uk is part of a major nationwide drive to increase participation in angling. To promote the launch on 9 June 2015, Fishinginfo.co.uk teamed up with the popular comic actor Paul Whitehouse to produce a film starring Paul as the ‘Brilliant Kid’ . Paul is an Angling Trust Ambassador and was very keen to reprise the ‘Brilliant Kid’ character made famous by the hugely successful BBC comedy series ‘The Fast Show’. Paul Whitehouse said: It was a pleasure to get involved and put something back into a sport that I have loved since I was a kid. I enjoyed playing ‘Brilliant Kid’ again in what will probably be his last hurrah. I hope that anglers and fans of the ‘Fast Show’ will enjoy the film. If we can encourage any more people to take up fishing then it will have been worth it. Mark Lloyd, chief executive of the Angling Trust, said: We are delighted to be launching Fishinginfo.co.uk . This new website will really make a difference for anglers looking to find new places to fish or getting back into fishing after taking some time out due to the pressures of family life. We urge all anglers, clubs and fisheries to use the update feature on the site to ensure that information is correct. We also want to make buying a rod licence as quick and simple as possible so our direct link to the Post Office website should help with that. Sarah Chare, Head of Fisheries at the Environment Agency, said: The Fishinginfo website is a fantastic new resource for all anglers and those wanting to get started. We are really pleased to have contributed to this initiative – another great example of how rod licence money goes back to benefit those who go fishing. Fishing is an excellent way to enjoy the outdoors, has great health, welfare and educational benefits and it is important to our economy. A coarse and trout rod licence is only £27 for the year and it is easy to buy online from the Post Office website which can be also be accessed through Fishinginfo.co.uk ."
/government/news/environment-agency-continues-its-clampdown-on-illegal-fishing,"Enforcement teams continued their clampdown on illegal fishing, issuing 90 offence notices for close season offences across England. Environment Agency continues its clampdown on illegal fishing  Environment Agency Environment Agency enforcement teams continued their clampdown on illegal fishing, issuing 90 offence notices for close season offences across England from the start of close season (15 March) to the end of May. Patrols focused on a range of illegal fishing – including close season offences and fishing without a valid rod licence. ‘Close season’ – which runs from 15 March to 15 June inclusive – is when coarse angling is suspended on rivers, streams and specified canals and stillwaters to protect spawning fish. Officers notched up more than 570 patrols up and down the country looking for close season offences – 90 anglers were reported for this offence alone. The Environment Agency also carried out two rod licence ‘blitzes’ over the May bank holiday weekends – a particularly popular time for anglers. Over the two May bank holiday weekends, Environment Agency teams made more than 940 visits to waters, served more than 580 offence report forms for illegal fishing and checked more than 7,800 licences. The maximum fine for fishing without a licence is £2,500 – and an annual licence costs just £27. Sarah Chare, Environment Agency head of fisheries, said: Our enforcement teams have been in out in force – particularly over the last couple of bank holidays – and will continue to be over the coming months. The number of anglers caught red-handed is testament to how seriously we take illegal fishing but worryingly it shows a blatant disregard for the law and the health of fisheries. People who don’t buy a licence are not only cheating other anglers and the future of the sport but running the risk of criminal conviction and a fine. There is no excuse – it costs just £27 for a whole year and you can buy it from the Post Office website. The Environment Agency’s work is intelligence-led, meaning that work is targeted on areas where there are reports of evasion or are known illegal hotspots. Last year, Environment Agency officers checked more than 70,000 licences and prosecuted more than 2,100 licence cheats. Between them, they were ordered to pay fines and costs in excess of £500,000. To help crack down on unlicensed fishing the Environment Agency urges anyone to report illegal activity by calling 0800 80 70 60. Money raised from rod licence sales is invested in England’s fisheries, including a wide range of projects to improve facilities for anglers, manage predation, protect stocks from illegal fishing, plus fish restocking, invasive species eradication, habitat improvements, and working with partners to encourage people to take-up fishing for the first time. Annual rod licences for trout and coarse fishing remain at £5 for 12 to 16 year olds, £18 for senior and disabled concessions and £27 for non-concessions. Children under 12 can fish for free. Buying a licence online from the Post Office website saves time and administration costs, which means more of the income can be spent on improving fish stocks and fishing. More on rod licences and how to buy one here or direct from the Post Office Anglers can also buy a rod licence by calling the Post Office on 0344 800 5386 or by visiting any Post Office branch.

Steve Thomas, an Environment Agency fisheries specialist said: Those who already fish in the South West already know that there is a chance of encountering some exceptional fish in this area. We want to make it possible for more people of all abilities to enjoy angling and for our fisheries to provide a positive contribution to the quality of people’s lives. Any anglers who want to try their luck and skills on local riverbanks as the new season starts must buy a rod licence before they go.” The rivers in the South West offer species such roach, barbel, chub, dace, brown trout, pike and perch. A variety of stillwaters are also home to carp, bream and tench, with excellent trout fishing in many reservoirs. Steve said: Fishing is an excellent way to enjoy the outdoors, and has great health, welfare and educational benefits.

A prepared community is a resilient community  Environment Agency Flood wardens are key in helping their community to be prepared for flooding, acting as a link between their community and the responding organisations, and playing a vital role of a community’s response before, during, and after a flood. Working in partnership with Kent Fire & Rescue and the Kent Resilience Team, the Environment Agency are delivering a training session for all new flood wardens. The Environment Agency are particularly keen to hear from people who live in Canterbury, Ashford, Whitstable, Faversham, Seasalter, the Isle of Sheppey, Hythe, Dymchurch, St. Mary’s Bay, Deal, Folkestone, and Herne Bay. As part of the training, the flood wardens are getting an inside perspective into the work of the Environment Agency and its partners. They will also find out about the Flood Warning Service, warning and informing arrangements, emergency planning structures, and response arrangements. Luke Thompson, Environment Agency Flood Officer, said: So far, we have recruited 160 flood wardens for the Kent area, many of whom were in communities affected by flooding in 2013/14. It is essential to start increasing flood resilience for those communities at risk who didn’t flood during that winter. With this training we would like to give them more resilience, support and self governance. To make the communities more aware of the vulnerable situation they are in and to fully prepare them for a flood incident by helping them to develop a flood warden network. We are keen to encourage members of communities at flood risk to volunteer to help their community and neighbours in times of flooding by becoming a flood warden. If you are interested in volunteering as a flood warden to support your local community, please email KRF.Events@kent.fire-uk.org or call 01622 212409. The next flood warden training will be on Saturday 18 July at the Lenham Community Centre, 9.30am to 2pm. Location: Lenham Community Centre, Groom Way, Lenham, ME17 2QT."

Road closure for Norfolk flood repairs  Environment Agency It is anticipated that the works, immediately south of Ten Mile Bank village, Norfolk will take around 12 weeks; completing towards the end of September 2015. The road will remain fully closed and impassable throughout the construction works. The road closure will be maintained by Jackson Hyder, a contractor carrying out the work on behalf of the Environment Agency. Greg Murphy, Team Leader for the Environment Agency said: We recognise there will be some disruption to the local community. We trust they will understand the need to undertake these works as soon as possible in order to finish before the next flood season, thereby reducing the flood risk to people and property. Support and patience is appreciated during this time. The proposed works should not impact navigation although there is a risk that levels may need to be lowered if the current situation changes. There is currently an Advisory Navigation Notice in force. Residents have been kept informed via a detailed update brief that was posted to them 24 June 2015. The repairs The works will start with the removal of the poplar trees along the section of the failed embankment. Approximately 300 metres of steel sheet piling will then be installed along the river bank, between the edge of the road and the landward crest of the embankment, to stabilise the bank. The piles are vibrated into the ground using heavy machinery and it’s possible that residents nearby may detect a low hum when this work is underway. Noise levels will be continually checked to ensure the work causes as little disruption as possible. The works are likely to take between 2 to 3 weeks and there will be an increase in traffic movements during that period as the piles and other materials are brought onto site. Following the piling the flood embankment will be repaired. Unsuitable material from the failed embankment will be removed and replaced with imported clay. Repairs will also be made to the erosion protection along the river; rock and coir rolls will be used to encourage water vole colonisation. Finally, subject to agreement with Norfolk County Council Highways, the highway will be repaired which will improve the road surfacing and drainage."

Refuse derived fuel exports (RDF): recent trends  Environment Agency This project discusses the factors behind the sudden emergence and growth of exports of refuse derived fuel (RDF) from England. The market went from zero in June 2010 to just over 215,000 tonnes in January 2015. The majority of these exports were to the Netherlands, with Germany and Sweden starting to increase in importance from mid to late 2013. RDF is defined as material that is produced from waste, has undergone some sort of treatment process, and is intended for use as a fuel. Evidence from industry contacts, as well as a basic quantitative analysis of the English RDF export market, provided an explanation for the trend in exports of RDF from England since 2010. Some of the available data cover the whole of the UK, while some cover only England. However, as at least 80–85% of total UK RDF comes from England, the report treats all the datasets as if they cover just England."

/government/news/dont-be-caught-out-by-flash-flooding-be-prepared,"Know the risks to keep yourself safe Don’t be caught out by flash flooding - be prepared  Environment Agency North Yorkshire County Council and the Environment Agency are urging communities across the county to be aware of the dangers of flash flooding, and to take steps to prepare. Flash flooding tends to happen when heavy rainfall runs off land and quickly swells rivers and streams. It can also occur where drainage systems are overwhelmed by intense rainfall. The risk of such flooding tends to be highest in the summer, when higher temperatures can trigger intense thunderstorms. Last August, intense storms caused flash flooding in a number of communities across Yorkshire, including Garforth, South Milford, Pontefract and Castleford, while summer 2012 saw devastating flooding affect communities in Upper Calderdale. Kim Tan, Flood Resilience Advisor for the Environment Agency said: With summer thunderstorms it can be hard to accurately predict where exactly they will develop and how intense the rain will be. As a result, it can be very difficult to issue timely flood warnings – so it’s essential householders and communities develop flood action plans in advance. Steps you can take to prepare for flash flooding include: Move important items upstairs/ above ground level now as a precaution, as there will be little time to do such things during a flash flood Look out for forecasts of thunderstorms or heavy rain, and be alert to fast rising water levels with churning, dark water or a build up of debris in rivers and streams If flash flooding occurs, above all stay safe - never walk or drive through floodwater as it only takes 15cms of fast-flowing water to knock an adult over and 60cms to sweep away a 4x4 car or small lorry If you can’t get away in time, then move to higher ground or move upstairs if you are in a building with two or more storeys; Always co-operate with the emergency services and follow their advice once they arrive Robin Derry, Senior Emergency Planning officer for North Yorkshire County Council, said: While we cannot prevent the rain or prevent flooding entirely, we can help communities become more resilient. Knowing your flood risk is the first step to protecting your family and property. Once you know the risks, you can put measures in place to stay safe. Both the Environment Agency and the Council are currently working in communities across North Yorkshire to raise both awareness and resilience. With their support, Hawnby, Rievaulx Abbey and South Milford Parish Councils have developed Community Emergency Plans which detail how local communities will respond to emergencies including flooding. If you would like to become actively involved to get your community prepared first speak to your parish/town council to check work is not already underway. Otherwise please contact the Environment Agency on 03708 506 506 for advice, or visit www.emergencynorthyorks.gov.uk ."
/guidance/crc-energy-efficiency-scheme-account-or-organisation-changes,"How to appoint an agent or account representative, make changes to your CRC Registry account and changes you need to tell us about. CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme: account or organisation changes Energy efficiency Environment Agency CRC : appointing account representatives When you registered for Carbon Reduction Commitment ( CRC ) you provided contact details for your nominated points of contact in your organisation. These are called your authorised contacts and are: a senior officer – a director or chief executive with authority to act on behalf of an organisation or group a primary contact and a secondary contact – authorised by the senior officer to act on behalf of the organisation a contact for invoices You can also appoint account representatives to carry out the same activities as the primary and secondary contacts. You can do this after you have registered. If you want to appoint account representatives, you need to provide the Environment Agency with their name and contact details. They will carry out checks on the business addresses provided and will send a password to your proposed account representatives at the address supplied. The Environment Agency will also send a letter containing a unique password to your senior officer for them to pass to the account representatives. This ensures that they are authorised to act for your organisation. The account representatives will need to enter these passwords when accessing your CRC Registry account for the first time. CRC : appointing an agent If you employ a consultant or third party and you want them to access your CRC account, one of your authorised contacts can nominate an agent using the CRC Registry. You can only nominate an agent who has already registered and enrolled in the CRC Registry and can provide you with their agent ID number. The screenshot guide ‘Agents in CRC ’ will help if you want to register as an agent. CRC Registry: changing your account details Your existing authorised contacts can update contact details in your CRC Registry account. These are your: primary contact secondary contact account representative (if you have appointed any) agent (if you have appointed one) Changing your name and address details For your highest UK parent and participant equivalents ( PE ) your authorised contacts can update: name trading name address SIC code They can also update the name and address of any overseas parent. To make these changes they need to: Log in to your CRC Registry account. Click on ‘phase 2’ in the box called ‘phase’ on the home page. Click on ‘change parent and/or participant equivalent’ in the box called ‘registration’. Click on the name of the particular PE or parent whose details they want to amend. Changing primary member of a group If your organisation is part of a group, your primary member is the organisation that you nominated to be responsible for managing your group’s compliance with CRC . They are also known as your compliance account holder. To change your primary member, one of your authorised contacts should: Log in to your registry account. Click on ‘phase 2’ in the box called ‘phase’ on the home page. Click on ‘change parent and/or participant equivalent’ in the box called ‘registration’. Select from the drop down list the name of the PE or parent they would like to be the new primary member. If they want to select an organisation that is not a PE or parent as the new primary member they need to follow steps 1-3 above and then: Select ‘other’. Click ‘next’. Enter the details of the new organisation The Environment Agency will carry out due diligence checks on this organisation if they haven’t already done so. Adding a new contact Authorised contacts can add a new contact to your account by clicking the ‘manage contacts’ button on the home page and selecting the ‘add new contact’ button. The role must then be allocated to the new contact by clicking on the appropriate phrase from the home page and selecting the option ‘assign contact roles’ in the registration section. The registry will generate a PIN which will be sent to the senior officer to pass to the new contact. Your new contact will need a Government Gateway account and the PIN to log onto the CRC Registry for the first time and enrol. You can’t add a new contact by simply editing an existing contact person’s details. This will not generate the new reference number or PIN and your original contact will no longer be able to access the CRC Registry. CRC Registry: lost ID or password You have two options if you lose your log on ID or password. Option 1: request a reminder of your ID or password Email the CRC helpdesk for a reminder of your ID or password. You will need to provide them with the CRC reference number and PIN that you used to enrol. It takes 2-7 days to receive a user name or password reminder letter from Government Gateway. If you have lost both, the letter will take 5-10 days. If you log onto the CRC Registry using a Government Gateway account that is not registered in your name, this option will not be possible for security reasons. You will need to use option 2 below. Option 2: request an access reset The CRC helpdesk can reset the access by removing and re-adding contact details. They will need written authorisation from your senior officer to do this. This could be an email from the senior officer’s email address held on our records.

CRC : changes to group organisational structures If you are a primary member that reports on behalf of a group of undertakings, you need to tell the CRC team at the Environment Agency about certain types of changes to your organisational structure. These changes are called ‘designated changes’ and you must notify the CRC team within three months of the change. You can’t submit your annual report for that compliance year until you have told the CRC team about these changes and they have updated your structure on the registry. You need to notify a designated change if you: buy another company that is already a CRC participant, or is a PE – a single undertaking that would have qualified for CRC in their own right are bought by or merge with another participant organisation are a PE and leave your parent group to become a stand alone organisation You don’t need to tell the CRC team about minor organisational changes, but you do need to keep a record of them in your evidence pack. These could include: a transfer of assets only selling or buying a subsidiary that is not a PE creating a new undertaking since the qualification year structural change such as outsourcing to a third party To notify the CRC team of a designated change: log in to your CRC Registry account click on the ‘inform of designated change button’ submit the data requested The CRC team will amend your structure on the registry and tell you how the change affects your organisation’s CRC liabilities. The document ‘ CRC guidance for participants in phase 2’ has more information about designated changes. Annex G of this guidance provides more detailed examples. Administration, liquidation or closing down If your organisation, primary member, or any of its PEs, goes into administration, liquidation or receivership, you must contact the CRC helpdesk at CRCHelp@environment-agency.gov.uk . They will explain what you need to do to stay compliant with CRC . Liability under CRC is on a group basis. If the primary member goes into administration, liquidation or receivership, the rest of the group still needs to comply with CRC . One of the remaining solvent organisations in the group would need to register as the group’s new primary member. It would continue to file reports and surrender allowances on behalf of the whole group. If there are no solvent members left in your group, contact the CRC helpdesk. Public sector changes The merger of your organisation with another public body is a designated change and you must inform the CRC team. If you are a government department, you need to tell the CRC team if: a new department is created from parts of your existing department part of your department is transferred to another your department merges with another to create a new department the government decides that part of your department must participate separately in CRC Reporting supplies after your group structures change If you have bought a participant organisation or a PE , and they have become part of your participant group, you need to report their energy supplies for the whole CRC reporting year (April to March) the change took place in. This is regardless of whether you have owned them for only part of the year. If the PE decides to remain as a separate participant, they will continue to report their own energy supplies. If you have sold a participant or PE , you don’t need to report its energy supplies for the compliance year in which the change took place.

/government/news/fish-stocks-boost-for-the-river-dearne,"3,000 young barbel released by the Environment Agency Fish stocks boost for the River Dearne  Environment Agency The Environment Agency has introduced 3,000 young barbel into to the River Dearne as part of an ongoing project to restore the river’s fish populations. The juvenile barbel, a bottom-feeding species of fish, were put in groups of 600 in sites at Adwick, Bolton-upon-Dearne, Darfield, Cundy Cross and Barugh Bridge. This is the third year of a six-year stocking programme. Anglers told the Environment Agency that barbel had been proving more elusive to catch on the river and official surveys confirmed that young fish were few and far between. Fisheries officer Jerome Masters said: Hundreds of barbel were released into the River Dearne back in 1999 and 2002 but we never saw large numbers of young being produced in the river. Water quality has continued to improve since then, and ongoing habitat improvements combined with fish passes mean that the River Dearne is a far better place for barbel than it was back then. This is why the time is right to give this species another helping hand. Barbel are very popular with anglers and are renowned for their fighting prowess once hooked. Adults can reach up to 20lb in weight. The Environment Agency releases fish into our waterways annually. Fisheries officers target fish stocking activity using data from local fish surveys to identify where there are problems with poor breeding and survival. The fish have been supplied by the Environment Agency’s fish farm in Calverton, Nottinghamshire, and their introduction has been funded by the rod licence money that anglers pay annually."
/government/news/surrey-waste-site-ordered-to-pay-19000,"A waste company in Worcester Park has been ordered to pay a total of £19,000 in fines and costs after today pleading guilty at Guildford Crown Court for operating an illegal waste transfer station.  Surrey waste site ordered to pay £19,000  Environment Agency Charges were brought when an Environment Agency investigation found Feely Skip & Grab Hire Ltd, of The Old Mill, Old Malden Lane, Worcester Park, Surrey, operating a waste facility without an environmental permit or exemption. Company director Mr David Feely rented land in Worcester Park for parking and storage, but Environment Agency officers found that the site was actually being used as a waste transfer station for construction and demolition waste. The court heard that the site was being used to store 4,000 tonnes of construction demolition waste, and at least 17 skips of builders’ waste including plastic piping, carpet off cuts, wooden panels, paper and cardboard. Later under interview Mr Feely the company director admitted that he intended to clear the site quicker but the waste had got out of hand. Mr Feely pleaded not guilty and his offence was left on the file in view of the guilty plea by the company. His Honour Judge Critchlow took into account the Sentencing Guidelines and the fact that Mr Feely had been warned about taking in waste in the past. He also found that this was not the most serious of offences, there was an early guilty plea and the defendant was making a contribution to the clearance costs incurred by the landlord. He therefore fined the company £10,000, ordered it to pay £9,000 towards the prosecution’s costs, and imposed a victim surcharge of £120. Alan Cansdale, Environment Agency Environment Manager, said: The court heard today how waste crime can undermine legitimate businesses. The company took in waste inappropriately, and the site posed a risk to the local environment. Mr Feely was warned by his landlord on two previous occasions that he was breaking the law. In cases like this, where individuals or businesses operate illegally, the Environment Agency has no hesitation in prosecuting."
/government/news/boats-checked-in-north-east-fisheries-patrols,"Patrols protect the commercial salmon and sea trout fishery Boats checked in North East fisheries patrols  Environment Agency Environment Agency officers checked eight vessels and recovered two abandoned illegal nets during boat patrols in the North East. Last week the fisheries patrol boat ‘Shearwater’ carried out enforcement and regulatory patrols on the commercial salmon and sea trout fishery off the North East coast. Heading out of Teesport, she steamed north before patrolling the River Wear estuary and then continuing north to Blyth. During patrols last Wednesday eight licensed vessels were checked between Sunderland and Blyth, with all compliant. At the River Wear estuary, two illegal nets which had been abandoned were recovered, and they will be destroyed. One of the nets had caught a sea bird which subsequently died, showing the indiscriminate nature of illegal nets and the damage caused to the environment by poaching. The fisheries enforcement team joined forces with other Environment Agency teams for patrols meaning Shearwater is also used for sampling and monitoring of fish stocks and diversity across the region, as well as for enforcement. The Environment Agency’s Fisheries Technical Specialist at Northumberland, Durham and Tees, Kevin Summerson, said: This was a successful patrol which showed by teams working together we can monitor and regulate our coastal salmon fishery, protecting stocks for future generations of anglers and fishermen alike."
/government/news/closing-in-on-illegal-vehicle-dismantlers-in-boston,"The Environment Agency and partners are cracking down on illegal vehicle dismantlers and unlicensed scrap metal dealers in Boston. Closing in on illegal vehicle dismantlers in Boston  Environment Agency The Agency, with officers from Lincolnshire County Council and Boston Borough Council, has carried out a third visit to sites in the area, giving operators final warnings and deadlines to comply. Others were invited to attend interviews under caution. Commercial vehicle dismantling and scrap metal businesses need permits to operate, both from the Environment Agency and planning authorities. When a vehicle has reached the end of its useful life it must be scrapped at an authorised treatment facility. Environment Agency Enforcement Officer Peter Stark said: “Waste crime can have serious detrimental effects on the environment. We want to support legitimate permitted waste operators – who can lose income to illegal operations – while ensuring there is no harm to people and the environment from sites treating waste vehicles and scrap metal. “We will continue to clamp down on illegal operators, providing advice to those who want to comply and stopping those who flout the regulations. We’re also appealing to landowners to ensure they do not allow illegal activities on sites or land they lease to businesses or individuals.” Waste oil from dismantled vehicles can contaminate land and may have to be excavated and removed for disposal at significant costs to the landowner. It can also pollute groundwater and find its way into drains and rivers. Waste tyres and interiors from cars are also sometimes abandoned and left for landowners to remove at great cost. It’s important that landowners check before signing a contract with businesses or individuals and ensure the contract complies with regulations. The Environment Agency is asking the public to inform them of any illegal vehicle dismantlers - reports can be made anonymously via our 0800 807060 incident hotline or to Crimestoppers 0800 555 111. If you are selling your scrap to a collector or yard please ask to see their scrap metal licence, issued by Boston Borough Council, and do not under any circumstances ask for cash; you should be paid by cheque or bank transfer. If you want to dispose of your old vehicle, ensure it is taken to a permitted site where it can be fully de-polluted without the risk of harming the environment. Advice and application forms to apply for a scrap metal dealer licence have been provided to operators at all the sites visited. Operators who fail to apply for a scrap metal dealer licence will be subject to enforcement action. For further information on scrap metal dealers licences, contact Boston Borough Council on 01205 314242. To find out how to register as a waste carrier, contact the Environment Agency on 03708 506506 or visit the Register or renew as a waste carrier, broker or dealer page on our website.

They were arrested at 4.30am on Thursday, July 23, when Environment Agency officers and Northumbria Police stopped a vehicle at Hagg Bank near Wylam. Three men aged 47, 33 and 29 were arrested on suspicion of salmon poaching, it’s suspected they were poaching salmon using illegal nets, which are extremely damaging to fish stocks. The fish, nets and other equipment was seized, along with the vehicle the men were using, and the investigation is ongoing. The Environment Agency’s Fisheries Technical Specialist Kevin Summerson said: We take reports of suspected poaching seriously and work closely with police to take action where appropriate. At this time of year salmon and sea trout are returning to rivers to spawn and protecting returning fish is vital to maintaining a healthy fish population. We’ll continue to target all aspects of illegal fishing activity, particularly where serious illegal and potentially damaging methods are used. Anyone discovered committing offences could face a substantial fine at court. The Environment Agency urges anyone to report illegal fishing by calling 0800 80 70 60. All income from rod licence sales is used to fund Environment Agency work to protect and improve fish stocks and fisheries, including improving habitats for fish and facilities for anglers, tackling illegal fishing and working with partners to encourage people to give fishing a go.

/government/news/river-thames-scheme-have-your-say,"The Environment Agency and local councils working together on the River Thames Scheme have arranged events for local communities.  River Thames Scheme: have your say  Environment Agency The Environment Agency and local councils working together on the River Thames Scheme have arranged a series of events for local communities to find out more about the scheme and share ideas on what it could look like. Between 25 August and 15 September 2015 they are running a series of ‘drop-in’ sessions at various locations between Datchet and Teddington. There will be information on display and experts on hand to talk to. Everyone interested in their work is invited to attend. The Environment Agency and local councils will be sharing information on how work has progressed since the Lower Thames Strategy was published in 2010. Visitors can also find out about the next steps and likely timescales. They want to hear people’s views on what the new flood relief channel could look like and how people would like to be kept up to date with progress. David Murphy, Project Director for the Environment Agency said: We really want to get local residents and businesses involved in the scheme, to hear their views on the proposals and explore what other benefits it could bring to the local area in addition to reducing flood risk to over 15,000 homes and businesses. This scheme will reduce flood risk right across the area and we need the support of the communities to make it happen. The Environment Agency and local council partners have been working with community groups in this area for many years to improve resilience to flooding. The River Thames Scheme will reduce flood risk to the 15,000 properties currently at risk between Datchet and Teddington. It will include construction of a flood channel (in 3 sections), property level products to make homes more resistant to flooding, major and local flood plans and will provide other benefits to this area. The Environment Agency is working with 7 local councils to deliver the programme. Residents who come to these events can also find out if they are at risk of flooding and what they can do in their own properties and communities to reduce the risk. Everyone attending the events will be invited to give us their views about the proposed scheme and to join a mailing list to receive regular updates on progress, invitations to future events and be notified of any consultations. All the events run from 4 pm until 8 pm. No need to book.

/government/news/appeal-for-information-on-river-axe-pollution,"Environment Agency officers who are investigating the pollution of the River Axe at Mosterton, Dorset, are appealing for any information regarding the source of the pollution. Appeal for information on River Axe pollution  Environment Agency Environment Agency staff confirmed today that this stretch of the river is being polluted again by a small and hard to find oil leak. Last year, the Environment Agency had officers trying to identify this mysterious leak on several occasions with officers lifting manhole covers, checking drainage points and domestic heating oil tanks. However, they were unable to spot the source of the pollution. This was followed by a letter drop to approximately 40 properties, asking the residents to check their domestic heating oil systems and tanks. Last month, the mysterious oil leak returned and the Agency believes it is coming from a small leak which has a constant drip or a tank leaks to a certain level. This oil then finds its way into the surface water drainage system that runs down the main A3066 from Bowes Lane. The Environment Agency is now appealing for any information on where the pollutant might originate from and is urging people to come forward with any details on what may be responsible. The Environment Agency will continue to monitor the situation and carry out further investigations. Doug Parker for the Environment Agency said: Because of the nature of the oil it is causing an odour nuisance down the length of the High Street as well as polluting the Axe. It is possible that this problem has returned because an heating oil tank has been recently refilled. We would ask that any residents on a heating oil system to closely monitor their usage and oil level over these warmer months for any unusual losses. We urgently need to trace the source of the pollution as soon as possible to prevent any further risk to the environment. Members of the public with any information on the incident can call the Environment Agency’s 24 hour hotline on 0800 807060 or the Devon Enquiries Team on 01392 352400. Ends"

/government/news/environment-agency-awards-fisheries-contract,"The Environment Agency is set to award a landmark fisheries contract to the Angling Trust.  Environment Agency awards fisheries contract  Environment Agency This announcement follows a rigorous competitive process and is part of the continued drive towards greater partnership working leading to thriving fisheries and angling throughout England. The three key overarching priorities of the contract are to increase participation amongst existing and new anglers, tackle illegal angling and manage a fund to improve angling facilities. The contract will run for up to 4 years and is currently worth £1 million a year, although the value of the future contract may vary, depending on rod licence sales. Key elements of the contract include: providing expert advice to clubs and fishery owners on how to identify and secure additional funding improving facilities at fisheries and clubs for anglers encouraging take-up among junior anglers and address the recent decline in this age group retaining and recruiting more anglers to go fishing exploring options to develop the voluntary bailiff scheme which has been piloted in the South East working with enforcement partners (including the police), club and fishery owners to clamp down on angling-related rural crime. Sarah Chare, Environment Agency head of fisheries, said: This contract marks a new era in how the Environment Agency will deliver our fisheries duties. By contracting and working with partners we will secure the best future for angling by playing to strengths and making rod licence income go further. It is what anglers deserve. We are delighted to be working with the Angling Trust on this endeavour. Mark Lloyd, chief executive of the Angling Trust, said: We are thrilled to have been awarded this contract and our ambition is to go above and beyond the requirements of the contract wherever possible. Both organisations are committed to protecting and improving freshwater angling by tackling the issues identified by anglers as part of the National Angling Strategy. The Angling Trust offers a very cost-effective way of delivering this work because of our extensive network and unique access to match funding. The contract has match funding clauses meaning that rod licence money goes further and the best possible service and value for anglers is delivered, for example through working with Sport England. Advertised through the Official Journal of the European Union, interested organisations expressed initial interest earlier this year. Applicants were then asked to complete a pre-qualification questionnaire to ensure they were suitable to be formally invited to tender for the work."
/government/news/river-thames-boaters-to-carry-on-cruising-thanks-to-1-million-investment-from-environment-agency,"The Environment Agency have confirmed which locks on the non-tidal River Thames are in line for improvement works this financial year. River Thames boaters to carry on cruising thanks to £1 million investment from Environment Agency  Environment Agency The Environment Agency confirmed yesterday (Tuesday 11 August) which of its 45 locks on the non-tidal River Thames are in line for improvement works during the remainder of this financial year. In all, 8 lock sites will have a total of more than £1 million spent on them. The seven-figure investment will ensure the locks and associated structures remain in good working order for years to come, enabling boaters to carry on cruising throughout the 135 miles of navigable waterway from Cricklade in Wiltshire, near the river’s source, to Teddington in Middlesex where the river becomes tidal. Work will start in November and continue through to March next year, avoiding the peak boating months to minimise disruption to river users. Included in the programme are iconic locks on some of the most tranquil and beautiful stretches of the river. Most locks will be closed to boating throughout this period as lock chambers will need to be drained of water or lock gates completely removed for work to be carried out. Barrie Douglass, the Environment Agency’s Waterways Engineer for the River Thames explained: Any work at a lock site, even a relatively minor repair, can be a complex undertaking. When we need to renovate a lock chamber for example, we have to install a coffer dam around it using sheet piling, then brace the chamber to maintain its structural integrity before pumping the water out so we can work in dry conditions. When gates have to be removed, we need to get a mobile crane with a boom of around 80 feet onto site, to safely lift out the gates, each of which weighs several tonnes. And before any of this happens, our in-house carpenters will have been hard at work fabricating new rubbing timbers, gate frames and other components out of solid lumps of sustainable tropical hardwood. The Environment Agency cares for over 1000 individual navigation ‘assets’ in total on the Thames, with an estimated combined value of some £425 million. These include major structures like locks, lock houses, access roads and bridges. Many are significant heritage features. Barrie continued: We’re proud to be the custodians of the navigation infrastructure on the non-tidal Thames, and we take the responsibility that comes with it very seriously. Maintaining critical navigation assets in safe working order is our number one priority. It has to be, because if we allow them to fall into disrepair and become unfit for use, then boating on the Thames as we’ve known it for the last hundred years or so would just not be possible. The income we get from boater’s registration fees isn’t enough to cover the cost of all the work we need to do each year, however. Fortunately, we receive a significant top-up from Government, which we invest very carefully to ensure maximum value-for-money for the taxpayer.

Business falls foul of all 3 producer responsibility regimes Environmental permits Environment Agency Babz Media Limited, an online trading company operating from Bilton Road, Perivale, Middlesex, has been fined for non-compliance with environmental legislation across 3 separate material types: packaging materials, batteries and electrical equipment. Known as producer responsibility, the legislation is designed to reduce the amount of packaging used, promote recycling and avoid waste ending up in landfill. The company pleaded guilty on 6 August 2015 at Ealing Magistrates’ Court to failing to register with the Environment Agency and a producer recycling scheme for packaging waste, waste batteries and electrical waste. Babz Media also pleaded guilty to avoiding the cost of financing the collection and recycling of the 3 waste streams between 2011 and 2013. This is the first time that a business has been prosecuted for breaching all 3 regimes. They are also the first business to be prosecuted for failing to comply with its batteries obligations in England. The company was ordered to pay a total of £45,500 in fines, and £8,724.98 to the Environment Agency for the avoided registration fees and prosecution costs. Circumstances of the case With a turnover of £19 million in 2014, its website states that they are one of the leading suppliers of electrical cables, blank media and batteries through online marketplaces. They stock over 2,000 household brands and supply them in bulk to trade. The court heard that Babz Media Ltd imported electrical goods and batteries from Europe for sale in the UK. Inquiries by the Environment Agency established that the company should have complied with all 3 waste regulations from 2011 but had failed to do so until 2014. The Company had imported 163.7 tonnes of batteries for sale between 2011 and 2013, 188 tonnes of electrical equipment in 2012 and 2013 and were obligated to recycle 76 tonnes of packaging waste in 2013. Hannah Wooldridge, Senior Environment Agency Officer said: This case shows that businesses must consider all aspects of regulation, and that environmental aspects are an important part of due diligence at all times. These regulations can affect all types of business no matter the method of selling. Online trading does not excuse companies from being compliant with the law. This company didn’t meet their legal obligations through ignorance after starting trading, they remained non-compliant for over 3 years and that impacted others in the market due to the commercial advantage they had. The regulations are there to increase recycling of valuable resources, support the recycling industry and reduce the use of packaging, WEEE and batteries in the first place. We will take robust action where breaches occur – online or otherwise. This is a substantial fine reflecting the seriousness of the case and Babz are the first producer to be prosecuted in England across all 3 producer responsibility regimes. In sentencing Babz Media, the court noted the early guilty plea and its co-operation with the Environment Agency, but said that it had been careless in not being aware of its obligations to register and finance the collection and recycling of waste it was responsible for.

/government/news/new-fish-survey-reveals-good-results-in-broads,"With the new coarse fishing season anglers are encouraged to buy a rod licence and explore excellent fishing in the beautiful Broads.     New fish survey reveals good results in Broads  Environment Agency In March and April this year, the Environment Agency’s fisheries staff led one of the largest rescue operations in its history to save more than 700,000 fish from a small area of the Broads in Norfolk (Hickling Broads and Upper Thurne). The fish had become trapped at the end of dykes while trying to escape from a deadly bloom of Prymnesium algae. See video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfYwGMJIGg8 Fisheries teams recently returned to the area to carry out a fish stock survey and the results were positive, with numbers of various species detected. The Agency’s Fisheries Technical Specialist for Essex, Norfolk and Suffolk, Steve Lane, said: Following the incident, we carried out a specialised high resolution sonar survey to see what fish are still present in the area. Our initial results show that there are still good numbers of fish with large bream, roach and pike seen spread over the area that was affected. We encourage people to buy a rod licence and enjoy the new season. We are continuing to work closely with all parties – the local angling community, research institutes, Broads Authority, Natural England and Internal Drainage Boards, to better understand the long term issues associated with Prymnesium and protect fishing for the future. The rest of the Norfolk Broads were unaffected by the Prymnesium incidents. Surveys and fishing results from the last few seasons have shown the Broads are able to offer superb angling opportunities for local and visiting anglers alike. Anglers can find Broads venue guides, tips, news and all relevant Broads related information on the Broads Angling Strategy Group website http://www.basgonline.org Notes for editors: Pictures and videos of the rescue, and teams using specialised technology for the survey, are available on request.

/government/news/350000-payback-for-illegal-waste-site-crimes,"Darlington man Tony Shepherd handed confiscation order by Teesside Crown Court £350,000 payback for illegal waste site crimes  Environment Agency A Darlington man has been ordered to pay back £350,000 under the Proceeds of Crime Act – one of the biggest seizures for the Environment Agency in the North East. And Tony Leigh Shepherd could have to pay back just under £1.2 million – the agreed benefit sum of his criminal activities – if he comes into future assets. Shepherd, 41, of Winston, pleaded guilty to two offences of operating an illegal waste site at West Musgrave Farm, St Helen Auckland, between August 2009 and March 2011. He also pleaded guilty to a third charge of operating an illegal waste site at Barrier Works, Hackworth Industrial Estate, Shildon, between December 5, 2010, and July 8, 2011. He had been running a waste transfer facility on the land – illegally depositing, sorting and storing mixed household and industrial waste. On February 24, 2014, he appeared at Teesside Crown Court where he was sentenced to 12 months in prison, suspended for two years. Environment Agency officers then began proceedings to recover the value of his available assets that it’s believed was obtained through crime. On Monday, August 17, following a confiscation hearing at Teesside Crown Court under the Proceeds of Crime Act, Shepherd was ordered to pay back £350,000. He could face a prison sentence if he fails to pay. And if he comes into future assets he could have to pay back more of the £1.168million agreed benefit sum. The Environment Agency’s Waste and Enforcement Manager for the North East, Andrew Turner, said: This is a significant confiscation order and sends out the message to others who flout the law that waste crime does not pay. They will not only be hit with court action but they’ll also be hit in the pocket. This is a debt for life for Shepherd as any assets in the future could go towards paying back the full amount. Waste crime undermines legitimate businesses and can have significant detrimental impacts on communities and the environment. This hearing demonstrates how seriously we take waste crime and we’ll continue to take action against those operating outside of the law and the regulations. A Proceeds of Crime investigation is still ongoing into Tony’s father Raymond Shepherd, who managed Albert Hill Skip Hire in Dodsworth Street, Darlington. He was jailed for 18 months in December 2013 after being found guilty following a trial of operating a regulated facility without a licence, unlawfully depositing controlled waste and failing to comply with a suspension notice."

/government/news/yorkshire-anglers-caught-in-fishing-licence-blitz,"Officers reported 49 anglers for fisheries offences Yorkshire anglers caught in fishing licence blitz  Environment Agency Environment Agency fisheries enforcement teams continued their clampdown on illegal fishing over the weekend in Yorkshire. Enforcement officers visited 18 fisheries across the region on Saturday 22 August and Sunday 23 August, checking a total of 235 anglers. Officers reported 49 anglers (21 per cent) for fisheries offences. Patrols focused on a range of illegal fishing and fishing without a valid rod licence. Peter Mischenko, fisheries officer at the Environment Agency in Yorkshire said: The number of anglers caught red-handed is testament to how seriously we take illegal fishing but worryingly it shows a blatant disregard for the law and the health of fisheries. People who don’t buy a licence are not only cheating other anglers and the future of the sport but running the risk of criminal conviction and a fine. There is no excuse – it costs just £27 for a whole year and you can buy it from the Post Office website. Officers have visited over 100 waters across Yorkshire this year looking for fishing offences. The maximum fine for fishing without a rod licence is £2,500 – and an annual licence costs just £27. The Environment Agency’s work is intelligence-led, meaning that work is targeted on areas where there are reports of evasion or are known illegal hotspots. Nationally, last year (2014/2015), Environment Agency officers checked more than 70,000 licences and prosecuted more than 2,100 licence cheats. Between them, they were ordered to pay fines and costs in excess of £500,000. In Yorkshire, last year officers checked 7,027 anglers resulting in 520 of them being reported for various fisheries offences but mainly for fishing without a licence. In the same year 248 offenders were prosecuted with an average fine of £228. To help crack down on unlicensed fishing the Environment Agency urges anyone to report illegal activity by calling 0800 80 70 60. Money raised from rod licence sales is invested in England’s fisheries, including a wide range of projects to improve facilities for anglers, manage predation, protect stocks from illegal fishing, plus fish restocking, invasive species eradication, habitat improvements, and working with partners to encourage people to take-up fishing for the first time. Annual rod licences for trout and coarse fishing remain at £5 for 12 to 16 year olds, £18 for senior and disabled concessions and £27 for non-concessions. Children under 12 can fish for free. Buying a licence online from the Post Office website saves time and administration costs, which means more of the income can be spent on improving fish stocks and fishing. Anglers can also buy a rod licence by calling the Post Office on 0344 800 5386 or by visiting any Post Office branch. Alternatively, you can buy your licence through the Angling Trust’s mobile-configured website, www.fishinginfo.co.uk .

/government/news/does-your-oil-tank-leak,"It feels like autumn is already here and many households will soon be getting oil delivered ready for winter.   Does your oil tank leak?  Environment Agency It is also the time of year when the Environment Agency urges people to check their oil tanks to protect the environment and reduce the risk of potentially large financial losses. Leaked oil can end up in drains, many of which lead directly to rivers, streams, lakes and even garden ponds, having the same effect as pouring it directly into the watercourse. Oil is poisonous to fish and other wildlife and smothers plants and just 2 litres of oil could seriously pollute the volume of fresh water needed to fill an olympic-size swimming pool. Senior Environment Officer Jamie Fairfull said: “Heating oil can cause serious problems if it gets into the environment. But it’s not just the cost of losing the oil that can be expensive, clean up costs can be large and are not always covered by household insurance policies. “This is why it is vital that oil is only ever stored in tanks that are in good condition. Both the tank and pipe work should be regularly inspected and people should never buy more oil than they can safely store.” Checklist Householders with domestic oil tanks should take the following action to ensure they are safe for use: *Site tanks as far away as possible from drains, streams and ponds. *Inspect tanks, pipes and other equipment for leaks, damage and interference once a week. Any problems should be fixed as soon as possible by an Oil Firing Technical Association (OFTEC) technician. http://www.oftec.org.uk/ *Arrange for the boiler and tank to be serviced at least once a year by an (OFTEC) technician. This should include any underground pipe work. *Monitor how much oil they use. If the volume of oil being used suddenly increases, there could be a leak. *Supervise oil deliveries. People should never allow their tank to be overfilled and should not order more oil than they can safely store. *Check their home insurance covers clean up costs on both their property and neighbouring land. Always notify insurers immediately in the event of a spill or suspected spill. *If a tank starts leaking, householders should try to stop the oil soaking into the ground or going down drains. They should contact their insurance company to arrange for an OFTEC technician or UKSpill-accredited clean-up company http://www.ukspill.org/ *Secondary containment (such as a bund) will prevent oil from escaping into the environment if a leak occurs. This is a legal requirement for domestic tanks which store more than 3,500 litres. To report an oil spill or leak, people should contact the Environment Agency’s 24-hour emergency hotline on 0800 807060."
/government/news/efforts-to-improve-water-quality-in-cramlington-burn,"The Environment Agency is working with partners to improve water quality in a Northumberland burn following recent pollution incidcents  Efforts to improve water quality in Cramlington burn  Environment Agency The Environment Agency is working with partners and local residents to improve water quality in a Northumberland burn. The Horton Burn at Cramlington has suffered a number of pollution incidents and the Environment Agency has been working with partners, including Northumbrian Water, to identify the causes and find solutions. The main impact appears to be the spilling and leaking of oils and chemicals from nearby industrial estates. Neil Paisley, from the Environment Agency’s Environmental Management team, said: We work with Northumbrian Water to investigate reports of pollution in the burn and try to find the source, which can be difficult as there are 17km of surface water sewer running through the industrial estates. In addition pollution incidents can often be short lived or may have been sitting in the sewer for a number of days. We’ve been placing tracers in sewers to try to identify sources of pollution, have delivered pollution prevention leaflets to businesses on the estates and we’ve carried out visits to estate landlords to encourage them to educate their tenants on the impact of spillages. Other issues in the burn can be associated with nearby residential areas, which are served by separate foul and surface water systems, and any liquid poured down road drains could ultimately find its way into the burn. One recent pollution incident is believed to have been caused by a resident pouring a paint-like substance down a surface water drain. And there are also some issues with cross-connections, which is when household appliances like washing machines, dishwashers and sinks are mistakenly connected to the surface water drainage system – which often happens when extensions are built. Neil added: It’s important to ensure that you or your builder makes the right connection to the foul sewer and that you are cautious when pouring anything down the road drains. We’re working closely with our partners and residents in the area to find longer-term solutions to pollution incidents at Horton Burn and would encourage people to get in touch with us with information. Mike Madine, Northumbrian Water’s Sewerage & New Development Manager, said: We’re committed to protecting the environment and this initiative will encourage our customers to help us look after the water courses in their local community. We appreciate that wrong connections may have been made many years ago and property owners may not be aware. They could also have happened accidentally or been made in ignorance or by carelessness when extensions or house alterations were built. Everyone can play a part in protecting our environment by checking connections are correct.” It’s important if you see pollution in the Horton Burn to contact the Environment Agency’s 24-hour incident hotline on 0800 807060."

Working as part of a team led by professional lock and weir keepers, volunteers will have the opportunity to spend their days outdoors, helping boats through locks and gaining real, hands-on experience of lock keeping along the River Thames. Andrew Graham, Thames Waterway Manager at the Environment Agency, said: I am delighted to say that since 2011 our Volunteer Assistant Lock Keeper project has gone from strength to strength. Numbers increase, bringing new faces to the river, but what remains constant is the enthusiasm brought by our volunteers. We want to work with members of the local community to bring their local knowledge to the lock side. For many, working alongside our permanent staff and other volunteers is a really sociable and rewarding activity. Last year 225 volunteers attended our sites throughout the season and we have already had a good number expressing their interest in returning this year. However, we are still keen on hearing from anyone who is interested in joining us this summer. As well as helping boats to pass through the lock, volunteers can use what they know about the Thames and its surroundings to help us to inform visitors about all it has to offer. Enthusiasm, a willingness to learn and a helpful nature are the main attributes we are looking for in our volunteers. Training will be provided for all successful candidates, as well as a selection of branded uniform. The Environment Agency will also provide the best opportunities for volunteers to increase their knowledge of the River Thames while building on their passion for the river. Lock volunteers need to be relatively fit as the role involves lots of physical activity especially walking up and down the lock side. A keen interest in river life is also a must and candidates need to be able to offer at least one day per week between May and October. The River Thames is a destination for boating enthusiasts throughout the year, but during the summer it becomes the focus of activity for boaters, walkers, festivals and events especially at weekends. Why not become part of this by becoming a Thames Volunteer? For more information or an application pack please email thames.volunteers@environment-agency.gov.uk or call 01491 828360."

They joined Northumberland Wildlife Trust to carry out a litter pick at Druridge Bay – one of the county’s most popular beaches – on Friday. Northumberland County Council also joined in, with staff removing the rubbish collected at the end of the day. Environmental Monitoring Officer Laura Corrigan organised the event. She said: Marine litter is a real problem for our local marine wildlife on the Northumberland Coast, with hundreds of species accidently eating or becoming entangled in litter. Druridge Bay is a beautiful area of Northumberland and extremely popular with families and walkers. We work closely with our partners in each of our different roles to ensure it stays that way. By putting aside a few hours to carry out a sweep of the beach together, it ensures it’s clean and tidy and minimises the impact on the environment and wildlife. Hopefully it will encourage beach users to take note and make sure they dispose of their litter responsibly, or better still, reduce, reuse or recycle where possible. Much of the litter collected was plastic bottles, carrier bags and cigarette butts, which can have detrimental effects on marine wildlife and impact on water quality."

/government/news/kent-company-fined-40000-for-illegal-waste-activity,"Two Kent waste companies have been ordered to pay a total of £44,294 for illegally tipping waste on flood plain near the River Medway. Kent company fined £40,000 for illegal waste activity  Environment Agency Fastrac Contractors and Utilities Limited, of Cuxton Industrial Estate, were found guilty in their absence and fined £40,000 with £1650 costs, at Sevenoaks Magistrates Court. Bennett Grab Services, of Burleigh Sole Street, Cobham, Gravesend, pleaded guilty and were fined £2000, with costs of £404. Charges were brought against both companies when an Environment Agency investigation discovered building waste and rubble being tipped at River House, Station Road, Cuxton, which was not covered by an environmental permit. The court heard that on a site visit in 2013 Fastrac company director Mr Paul Davies admitted to having tipped 80 loads of waste at the site; the Environment Agency issued a letter requiring Fastrac to cease the deposit of waste at this location until getting the appropriate permission. However, in November 2013 after no further information had been supplied by Fastrac the Environment Agency served statutory notices on both Fastrac and the landowner to provide waste transfer information about wastes deposited at this site. These revealed that a further 47 lorry loads of waste had been received at the site since the letter of 12 July 2013. In interviews, Mr Davies said that the landowner was a friend of his who had asked him to fill in some land, stating his organisation did not tip waste at the site after the date of the warning letter but that waste materials taken from third party construction sites were being stored there. He later conceded that he had tipped 9 loads at the site and he now understood that he had committed an offence. The Magistrates in sentencing Fastrac Contractors and Utilities Limited acknowledged that the continued tipping had been a deliberate act and that there had been a risk of harm to the environment. The Environment Agency investigation also discovered Bennett Grab Services had deposited soil at the same location. In sentencing Bennett Grab Services, the Magistrates took into consideration their early guilty plea but said that a company in the waste business should be aware of the checks that needed to be made to ensure a site was properly authorised before depositing waste. Alan Cansdale, Environment Agency Environment Manager, said: The court heard today how waste crime can undermine legitimate businesses and damage the environment. The illegally tipped waste in Cuxton compromised the flood plain around the River Medway. Without an environmental permit application, no assessment had been made regarding the impact of deposits in this area of flood plain and the potential to exacerbate flooding elsewhere. In cases like this, where individuals or businesses operate illegally, the Environment Agency has no hesitation in prosecuting."

He was ordered to pay a £50 fine, £717 in costs and a £15 victim surcharge. The court heard that on 9 August 2014, Environment Agency enforcement officers were patrolling as part of Operation Stone, a programme of targeted fisheries operations to reduce illegal fishing, fish removal and theft on the rivers Severn and Avon. Mr Doniks was approached by an officer while returning to his vehicle. The officer asked Mr Doniks to produce his rod licence as he had been seen fishing on the river earlier that day. The defendant was unable to provide proof of a valid rod licence. After Environment Agency officers had processed the defendant for the rod licence offence they returned to the location where he had been seen fishing earlier that day. There the officers found a bag containing a dead bream and eel. In court Mr Doniks pleaded not guilty and claimed he was sat on the riverbank but was not fishing.

Arrests made for poaching offences in north east  Environment Agency Three men have been arrested after illegal fishing nets were recovered in Northumberland. Environment Agency officers made the arrests at Hagg Bank near Wylam in the early morning of today, September 18, in a joint operation with Northumbria Police. Three men aged 48, 37 and 30 were arrested on suspicion of salmon poaching. It’s suspected they were poaching salmon on the River Tyne using illegal nets, which are extremely damaging to fish stocks. Two nets were seized during the operation, which had 13 fish inside. The fish, nets, and other equipment were seized and the investigation is ongoing. At the end of July three men were arrested under similar circumstances in the same location in a joint operation between the Environment Agency and Northumbria Police. The Environment Agency’s Dave Edwardson said: Poaching has a serious impact on salmon stocks in our rivers as well as on angling and as a result the local economy. That’s why we take reports of suspected poaching seriously and work closely with the police to take action where appropriate. We’ll continue to take action against all aspects of illegal fishing activity to protect our fish stocks, particularly ensuring those using serious illegal and potentially damaging methods are targeted. Northumbria Police Neighbourhood Inspector for Tynedale East, Julie Cole, added: Poaching remains a wildlife crime priority and officers are working closely with the Environment agency to tackle this crime. The activities of poachers is a concern to our rural communities and we’ve found that criminals are travelling into Northumberland, particularly the good fishing stretches of the Tyne as it runs through Tynedale, to take advantage of the excellent fishing conditions we have locally.

All of his equipment was also forfeited and will be destroyed following the Environment Agency investigation. He appeared at Sunderland Magistrates’ Court on Thursday, September, 17, where he pleaded guilty to four offences of fishing with a gill net without a licence. Acting on behalf of the Environment Agency, solicitor Simon Crowder told the court that on three occasions during September 2014, and one in October the same year, Burton was seen using a gill net to catch salmon and migratory trout at the River Wear at Low Southwick. He was arrested by Environment Agency officers both on September 29, and October 19, following enforcement operations. The net was recovered on October 20 with two dead migratory trout in it. The Environment Agency’s Dave Edwardson said: Gill nets are a destructive method of fishing designed for taking significant quantities of large fish. Given their impact on fish stocks, their use is very limited and requires a licence. Burton’s actions could cause serious damage to fish stocks and ruin the sport for legitimate anglers ad future generations.

Boost for boaters at Harbour of Rye  Environment Agency The new pontoons improve the access for boaters at the Harbour of Rye, making it much easier and safer to board a boat. The new pontoons are connected to the shore via a floating walkway, and provide improved accessibility for fishermen and boaters. Shore power is available on site alongside the vessels, and there is a secure gated car park. Harbour fishermen will benefit from the alongside moorings, as it is now much safer, easier and quicker for them to land their catch. The Harbour of Rye is important to the local economy, with an estimated value of £8 million every year. The new pontoon moorings are 100 metres in length, and cost £240,000. £112,000 of the funding came through a grant from the European Fisheries Fund, with the Environment Agency paying the rest. The new moorings have proved very popular and are already full. However, there is a waiting list that people can sign up to. For more information please call the harbour office on 01797 225225. The Environment Agency has completed the work ahead of the Harbour of Rye Advisory Committee (HORAC) elections which are currently taking place and run from 21 September to 11 October. HORAC plays a vital role in the work to manage the vibrant working harbour in Rye for both industry and leisure. James Bateman, Harbour Master, said: The Harbour of Rye is very important to the local economy, and the new pontoons will be a valuable asset. As well as improving safety they also improve accessibility at the harbour, and are built to last for at least 25 years. We look forward to working with the newly elected members of HORAC to continue to improve the harbour, which will also positively impact the town and local community.

The officers carried out 46 vehicle checks, out of which 13 vehicles carry waste as part of their business and provided advice to 6 of them that needed to carry the correct registration and transfer notes. Senior Environmental Crime Officer Helen Silk said: “The Environment Agency wants to make sure businesses carrying waste have the proper authorisations to allow them to transport and transfer waste - a waste carrier’s registration from the Environment Agency and waste transfer note from the waste producer. “Everyone who disposes of waste has a Duty of Care to ensure their waste is managed and disposed of correctly by the people they give it to. “Waste crime has an impact on people and the environment. It blights communities and causes pollution. “Waste being transported with no authorisations is likely to end-up at unregulated sites. Such sites store waste in vast quantities and for long period of time posing significant risks to health and the environment, like fires which could lead to water and land contamination plus air pollution from smoke. Illegal waste sites are often the cause of odour and fly complaints too. “People who manage waste illegally do not invest in appropriate safeguards. They undercut legitimate business, and pose a direct threat to sustainable growth in the waste management sector.” The Environment Agency is asking the public to inform them of any illegal waste carriers’ activities - reports can be made anonymously to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

/government/news/birmingham-man-given-1500-penalty-for-illegal-fishing,"On Monday 12 October, Wojciech Zabinski of Craythorne Avenue, Birmingham was found guilty at Cheltenham Magistrates’ Court of fisheries offences. Birmingham man given £1,500 penalty for illegal fishing  Environment Agency The offences included fishing for freshwater fish without a valid rod licence, leaving a rod and line with the bait or hook in the water unattended and giving a false name on the River Severn at Ripple, Tewkesbury. The defendant was given a 12 month Conditional Discharge, ordered to pay £1,500 in costs and a £15 victim surcharge. The court heard that on 12 October 2014, Environment Agency enforcement officers were patrolling the River Severn as part of Operation Stone, a programme to reduce illegal fishing, fish removal and theft on the rivers Seven and Avon. Mr Zabinski had been seen by an Environment Agency officer fishing and leaving his rod and line with the bait or hook in the water unattended earlier in the day. Mr Zabinski was approached by an officer as he was leaving the area for the above offences. Mr Zabinski provided his brother’s name and address as his own and gave the officer his brother’s rod licence. Speaking after the case, an Environment Agency Enforcement Officer in charge of the investigation, said: “Anyone who chooses to fish in England needs their own rod licence. The money raised by the sale of rod licences helps us to carry out vital work to help maintain, develop and protect fisheries. This case sends out a clear message that we will not hesitate to prosecute individuals when they do not abide by the law.” Illegal fishing can be reported to the Environment Agency hotline on 0800 80 70 60. You can also report illegal fishing and any other information on environmental crime anonymously to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."
/government/news/moor-spaces-available-on-thames-thanks-to-pilot-scheme-success,"The Environment Agency is rolling out new rules to stop boaters overstaying at its free 24 hour mooring sites.  'Moor’ spaces available on Thames thanks to pilot scheme success  Environment Agency Following a successful pilot scheme last year, the Environment Agency is rolling out new rules to stop boaters overstaying at its free 24 hour mooring sites along the River Thames – a real bone of contention for the majority of responsible boaters. The move will see car park style enforcement procedures introduced at all its 22 mooring locations. The new rules are intended to stop inconsiderate boaters staying at mooring points beyond their allotted time and preventing others from using them. A fine will be imposed on anyone who flouts the rules. At the 4 pilot sites where the rules were tested, compliance has rocketed with the Environment Agency receiving very few complaints about boats overstaying, proving that the system works. New mooring conditions will mean that more people can enjoy the many benefits that short term mooring sites bring to not only boaters but the wider community. Nick McKie-Smith, Waterways Operations Manager for the Environment Agency said: Abuse of moorings is a big problem for many public and large private landowners on the river; that in turn creates a problem for law abiding boaters who want to benefit from the free 24 hour mooring period at Environment Agency mooring sites along the Thames. We have listened to the concerns of our customers and feel that the success of our moorings pilot will not only benefit just boaters but the wider community as well. Boaters will now have a fairer opportunity to stay at Environment Agency riverside moorings to enjoy the local towns, restaurants, shops and leisure facilities which the River Thames has to offer. The Environment Agency and other public landowners (such as councils) provide the very popular short-stay public and visitor mooring sites to encourage passing boats to stop for short periods to enjoy the peace of the waterside and use of local amenities. Nick McKie-Smith added: Our pilot scheme has shown that a modern and faster enforcement solution is achievable for the River Thames. The extra 18 popular mooring sites which will be included in the scheme will deter abuse and help our enforcement officers concentrate on our other enforcement priorities such as speed and wash and registration offences. NSL Ltd has been awarded the contract to enforce mooring charges to anyone found breaching the new mooring conditions, which will be indicated on signage at Environment Agency moorings. The new mooring conditions will ensure spaces are freed up to allow a fairer system. Unless otherwise indicated, boat owners can stop for free on public open land owned by the Environment Agency, for a maximum period of 24 hours only. Some moorings have an associated charge, either for mooring at any time, or after an initial free period. Unfortunately, some boat owners ignore the time periods they are allowed to stay or do not pay the mooring fees where applicable."

/government/news/thank-you-for-5-glorious-years-on-the-river-thames,"It’s been 5 years since the Environment Agency started recruiting volunteer lock keepers to help keep boating on the Thames running smoothly.  Thank you for 5 glorious years on the  River Thames  Environment Agency Since 2011, over 360 volunteers have given up their time to compliment the professional lock and weir keeper team – spending their days outdoors, helping boats through locks and gaining real hands-on experience of lock keeping along the River Thames. As a ‘thank you’, the Environment Agency will be hosting a celebration at the River and Rowing Museum in Henley-on-Thames. Volunteers will be given awards as recognition for all their hard work and commitment with many receiving the prestigious ‘legacy award’ for 5 years of service. Andrew Graham, Thames Waterway Manager at the Environment Agency, said: The River Thames has played a major role over the last 5 years for a wealth of internationally important events. We have seen the Olympics, the Magna Carta anniversary and the Golden Jubilee to name but a few. When the world’s eyes were focussed on the Thames our volunteers helped to ensure that the waterway was running both efficiently and safely and I am very proud of their enthusiasm, dedication and passion for this magnificent river. Since 2011 the Volunteer Assistant Lock Keeper project has gone from strength to strength. Numbers have increased, bringing new faces to the river and valuable local knowledge to the lock side. Peter Crane, Volunteer Assistant Lock Keeper at Marlow Lock said: I started as a Marlow volunteer in 2011 and every day is different. There is always something new to see and learn which makes the experience so enjoyable. The scheme has gone from strength to strength with many volunteers returning year after year because they to find it so rewarding. I can only speak for Marlow but the volunteers are great and there is a good camaraderie. Derek Tomlin, Volunteer Assistant Lock Keeper at Cookham Lock said: When I drive into Cookham Lock on a Wednesday morning, I am greeted by the beautiful wooded cliffs of the Cliveden estate. The tranquillity is soon broken by the approach of the first boats, often the hire boats on their way back home. Everyone using the river is grateful for the assistance the volunteer lock keepers give in helping to tie up the boats in the lock and giving local knowledge by answering ‘where to shop?’, ‘where to moor?’ and ‘where is the nearest pub?!’ The reward is a day in the fresh air, exercise (you walk about 4 miles in a day) and the knowledge you have assisted in the safe passage of boats through your lock. In the 5 years I have been volunteering I reckon I have opened and closed the lock gates 4,000 times and assisted over 10,000 boats and always get a thank you from the crew as they leave the lock. William Partridge, Volunteer Assistant Lock Keeper at Benson Lock said: If you think you would like to do the same as me, then why not enquire for more details how you can become a Volunteer Assistant Lock Keeper. 2015 will be my fifth year as a volunteer lock keeper. I have enjoyed every moment of it, come rain or shine. I look forward to volunteering on my lock in the knowledge that I am helping boaters and lock staff alike. It gives me great pleasure to make a contribution on the River Thames. The River Thames Volunteer Team of the Environment Agency is still keen on hearing from anyone who is interested in helping on the Thames for summer 2016. Training will be provided for all successful candidates, as well as a selection of branded uniform. The Environment Agency will also provide the best opportunities for volunteers to increase their knowledge of the River Thames while building on their passion for the river. As well as helping boats to pass through the lock, volunteers can use what they know about the Thames and its surroundings to help inform visitors about all it has to offer. Enthusiasm, a willingness to learn and a helpful nature are the main attributes required. Notes to editors Lock volunteers need to be relatively fit as the role involves lots of physical activity especially walking up and down the lock side. A keen interest in river life is also a must and candidates need to be able to offer at least 1 day per week between May and October. The River Thames is a destination for boating enthusiasts throughout the year, but during the summer it becomes the focus of activity for boaters, walkers, festivals and events especially at weekends. Why not become part of this by becoming a Thames Volunteer? For more information or an application pack please email: thames.volunteers@environment-agency.gov.uk or call 01491 828360.

Are you signed up to your community flood gauge?  Environment Agency The gauge, installed by the Environment Agency and managed in partnership with Malvern Hills District Council, is used in areas at risk of flash flooding and where the Environment Agency are unable to provide their normal flood warning service. So far only a small number of residents from the 3 Worcestershire communities have signed up to the gauge, but there are still over 15 properties that could benefit from the information provided. The service is free and residents can register by contacting Nicola Manley on 0203 025 1546 or completing the forms held by the Parish Council Clerk Pamela Perfect. The newly installed gauge monitors levels in the Dick Brook. Any changes in water levels are recorded and an automated alert will be issued once river level thresholds are exceeded. The alerts, of which there are 4 levels, can be sent to landlines, mobile phones, email or a mixture of all 3. Once registered residents will also receive access to a website where they can monitor levels during periods of wet weather. The Environment Agency are also working with the community to develop an emergency response plan for each of the alert levels. Nicola Manley from the Environment Agency said: “Flash floods can happen very quickly, much faster than other forms of river flooding. These gauges help equip people who live in areas at risk with the information they need to prepare and protect themselves.” “Unfortunately we can’t provide Environment Agency flood warnings in areas that respond so quickly to rainfall, but these gauges are the next best step. I would encourage residents living in areas that have a community flood gauge installed to sign up.” Cllr Bronwen Behan, portfolio holder for environmental control, on Malvern Hills District Council said: “Flooding causes significant distress to those it affects. This scheme is an excellent example of how by working together we can protect our communities and provide reassurance to our residents.” Visit prepare for a flood for more information."
/government/news/new-flood-wardens-to-help-protect-hildenborough,"Hildenborough is to benefit from improved flood resilience after a new team of flood wardens were trained by the Environment Agency. New flood wardens to help protect Hildenborough  Environment Agency A group of 13 Hildenborough residents have been trained after volunteering to act as flood wardens and help their community before, during and after a flood event. Flood wardens act as a link between the Environment Agency and communities at risk of flooding, and disseminate information to their local community. As part of the training, the wardens were talked through the work the Environment Agency does, how the flood warning service works and local flood risk in their community, highlighting specific areas that are more susceptible for flooding and areas where debris can build up. Hildenborough was affected by flooding in the winter of 2013 and remains at risk of flooding from the River Medway. Hildenborough Parish Council and flood wardens have developed a community flood plan, and engaged with residents at risk of flooding so they better understand their risk, take action to prepare, know who their wardens are, and what they can do for them. Tim Norton, Environment Agency Flood Resilience Team Leader, said: Hildenborough has a team of brilliant flood wardens, who are really informed about their risk and committed to looking after their community. How communities prepare and work together before, during, and after flooding makes a real difference. Flood Wardens are vital to helping communities survive the effects of flooding. More volunteers and flood wardens are still needed in Hildenborough and Tonbridge. If you are interested in volunteering as a flood warden to support your local community, please contact the Kent Resilience Forum on 01622 212409."

Keep it clean and safe this Bonfire Night  Environment Agency Every year on November 5, families use old bits of furniture to build up the bonfire and stuff the Guy with scraps of used foam or old clothing. But everyone must remember that it is llegal to burn most types of waste and setting fire to treated wood, tyres, plastics, rubber and oil can seriously harm health and pollute the environment. It is also important to prevent others from dumping illegal waste on your bonfire by keeping it secure. There are also fears that people will use Bonfire night as an excuse to burn old furniture, mattresses or even household rubbish. If you’re organising a bonfire night this week make sure you know where the bonfire material has come from and it is suitable. If you suspect illegal activity report it anonymously to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111. People face a fine of up to £50,000 for illegally managing waste. They are urged to read Environment Agency advice on GOV.UK to make sure they are disposing of waste on bonfires safely and legally. The Environment Agency also wanted to remind event organisers and households they can only burn clean, non-commercial waste. Megan Evans, for the Environment Agency in Devon and Cornwall, said : Burning certain types of material can cause pollution and damage people’s health. We want people to enjoy themselves but the uncontrolled and excessive burning of the wrong waste can cause pollution and harm health. We want to encourage people to make sure they dispose of their waste legally and safely, and be aware that their community bonfire could be targeted by unscrupulous waste businesses who want to find somewhere to dispose of waste, resulting in the illegal burning of commercial waste. Organisers should ensure that they know where the bonfire material has come from and it is suitable. If anyone sees any suspicious activities they should contact us on 0800 807060 or report it anonymously to Crimestoppers. The Environment Agency asks organisers to make sure: waste is kept securely before being burned the material is suitable - it may include untreated wood, branches, and small amounts of leaves, cardboard and paper; never include plastics, rubber, glass or metal the size of the bonfire or campfire is appropriate Ends"

/government/news/flood-plans-and-warning-sirens-put-to-the-test-in-calderdale,"Flood sirens to be tested in Calderdale. Flood plans and warning sirens put to the test in Calderdale  Environment Agency The flood warning sirens in Walsden, Todmorden, Hebden Bridge and Mytholmroyd will be sounded next week (12 November) as part of the Environment Agency’s annual maintenance tests. The test is part of the Environment Agency’s Flood Action Campaign, taking place throughout November, and the local Todmorden and Hebden Royd flood groups in the Upper Calder Valley are taking this opportunity to raise awareness and encourage others to get involved. The Environment Agency uses the sirens to warn the Upper Calder Valley communities when rivers are expected to flood. There are eight sirens in the area with an audibility level similar to that used by emergency vehicles. This year all the sirens will be tested together on Thursday 12 November at 2:45pm. Each test will last for two minutes. Residents and businesses in the towns do not need to take any action when hearing the sirens at these times. Loud hailer vehicles will be used to alert people to the tests, ahead of the sirens being sounded. Following these tests, there will be a public drop-in session at the Hebden Bridge Town Hall from 4pm to 6pm where the Environment Agency, flood groups and Calderdale Council will be present, to provide advice on how to register for flood warnings and what to do in a flood. Jon Follows, Environment Agency Flood Resilience Officer said: It is important that we test the sirens to check that they are working properly and can be triggered remotely from our incident room in Leeds. Although no action needs to be taken during the test, people need to be aware that if they hear the sirens at any other time, then this means that flooding is expected. Flood water is dangerous, particularly in these areas where water cascading down from the steep surrounding hills means flooding can happen very quickly and with little warning. We would ask people not to put themselves at danger by driving or walking through fast moving flood water. We are also encouraging local residents and businesses to put together a flood plan to keep themselves and their families safe. Cllr Tim Swift, Leader of Calderdale Council said: The Council is committed to working with other organisations like the Environment Agency on flood prevention works. The siren test is a good reminder for people to make sure they are prepared if a flood hits. There are steps you can take to protect your property, and it’s helpful to have a flood plan in place and get involved with your local flood group. Keep updated at www.eyeoncalderdale.com and I encourage you to come along to the drop-in session to find out more. For the latest information on current flood warnings and the local weather forecast, Calderdale residents can visit the ‘Eye on Calderdale’ website – www.eyeoncalderdale.com To find out more about the dangers of flood water, to find out if your property is at risk of flooding and how to put together a flood plan for your home or business, call Floodline on 0345 988 1188 or visit the floods website ."

This move, which recognises the huge desire among anglers to develop their local facilities, has been made possible by good rod licence sales. The extra funding will be offered through rounds 3 and 4. Funding will be available to a wide range of freshwater angling providers, including clubs, commercial fisheries and angling projects, and there is no requirement to be Angling Trust affiliated. Projects must be located in England and involve a form of fishing requiring the purchase of an Environment Agency non-migratory and coarse Rod Licence. Awards of up to £5,000 are available for successful projects. Sarah Chare, head of fisheries at the Environment Agency, said: The Angling Improvement Fund is just one way we use rod licence money to work with partners for the benefit of angling. Healthy rod licence sales have enabled us to be able to put yet more money into these projects. I’m looking forward to seeing great results from the third and fourth rounds, especially those which encourage young people to give fishing a go and those which rejuvenate under-used or neglected fishing spots. Mark Lloyd, chief executive of the Angling Trust said: We are delighted to be able to distribute even more money to the country’s best angling improvement projects. We appreciate how disappointed many clubs and fisheries were to have missed out in Rounds 1 and 2 and so welcome the chance this extra funding gives us to look at those projects again. Funding will also be made available to new projects involving partnerships between clubs and fisheries and schools and for the creation, development and safeguarding of low-cost fishing at Community Waters, one of our National Angling Strategy priorities. The Angling Improvement Fund (formerly known as the Fishery Improvement Fund), administered by the Angling Trust, provides financial support for urgent facilities improvements at clubs and fisheries in England. It is one of the key elements in the new National Angling Strategic Services contract awarded to the Angling Trust as part of the delivery of the National Angling Strategy. So far this year the Fund has distributed £115,000 of Rod Licence income to 31 projects across the country.

/government/news/fish-stocks-boost-for-north-east-waters,"Fisheries experts have boosted stocks in the North East as the Environment Agency continues to develop and restore rivers in the region.  Fish stocks boost for North East waters  Environment Agency Fisheries experts have given a boost to stocks in North East waters as part of the Environment Agency’s ongoing plans to develop and restore rivers and lakes in the region. Fish including dace, chub, roach, crucian carp, tench, rudd and bream have been stocked into rivers and stillwater fisheries this week. At the River Skerne near Darlington, 4,000 chub, dace, roach and barbel have been stocked, and a further 3,000 dace, chub and barbell have been released into the River Wear near Durham. The River Don at South Tyneside and the River Tees at High Conniscliffe also received stocks of chub, dace and barbel. Stillwater fisheries in the region – Willows Reservoir at Barmston, Washington; Eden Grange at Station Town; Grey Towers Lake at Nunthorpe; Wheatley Hill; and Wydon Water near Hexham - have also been stocked with 15,000 roach, rudd, bream, tench and crucian carp to help improve angling. The Environment Agency releases fish into our waterways annually. Fisheries officers target fish stocking activity using data from national fish surveys to identify where there are problems with poor breeding and survival. Environment Agency Fisheries Officers Paul Frear and Robbie Stevenson led the work to introduce the fish to their new homes this week. Robbie said: “We’re pleased we can provide these fish for stocking as part of our commitment to rod-licence paying anglers. Restoration and the creation of new fisheries for all people to enjoy is a very important aspect to our work.” The River Skerne above Darlington has suffered from poor water quality and habitat degradation in the past, but a concerted effort by the Environment Agency has helped to turn this watercourse around. High Spring flows and cool summers, along with barriers to fish passage, on the Rivers Wear and Tees have impacted on coarse fish survival, so the Environment Agency stocks fish to help support impacted recruitment. The fish all come from the Environment Agency’s fish farm at Calverton, Nottinghamshire, where between 350,000 and 500,000 fish are produced each year to stock rivers across the country."
/government/news/help-track-down-invasive-plant-on-the-bedford-ouse,"Visitors to the River Ouse are being asked to report sightings of floating pennywort. Help track down invasive plant on the Bedford Ouse  Environment Agency Boaters, anglers and others who visit the River Ouse around Bedford are being asked to report any sightings of floating pennywort to the Environment Agency. Floating pennywort is an aquatic weed native to South America. The plant can quickly establish dense mats of vegetation, out-competing native species and dominating watercourses. The plant chokes waterways making it difficult for boats to navigate and increases the risk of flooding by clogging channels. It can also pose a threat to fish and other aquatic life by starving the water of light, oxygen and nutrients. The plant has not been spotted on this part of the Ouse before and the Environment Agency will be carrying out work to control the known patches this week. If treated early there is a good chance of eradicating it on this part of the river. Nina Birkby, Officer at the Environment Agency, said If people do see floating pennywort, which can grow up to 20cm a day, it is vital they don’t contribute to its spread. Boats should not be driven directly through clumps of the plant as it can break off pieces which will then re-grow elsewhere. Avoid picking and discarding pieces of the plant as these can grow and colonise new areas. We would also encourage people who are out and about to help to track down these problem plants and if they spot any patches they should report them to the Environment Agency on 03708 506506. They can also use a free App called ‘PlantTracker’. PlantTracker is available free from the iTunes App Store and Android Market by searching for PlantTracker (one word), or from the PlantTracker website . Floating pennywort first came into Britain during the 1980s as a plant for tropical aquariums and garden ponds, but by 1991 it had escaped into the wild. The plant is normally found in tropical aquaria and garden ponds. It is, however, being found more and more in rivers across the country and is a common problem on the Ely Ouse. Invasive non-native species cost the UK economy £1.9bn every year. Preventative action and investment to stop the spread and protect the UK’s rich biodiversity is essential so Check, Clean, Dry Check, Clean, Dry is a simple approach to reducing the risk of spreading invasives from one watercourse to another. Prevention is the cheapest and most effective method of controlling invasive species, which can cause profound, and often irreversible, damage to habitats. By thoroughly checking, cleaning and drying equipment that’s been used in a waterbody before putting it into another you can dramatically reduce the risk of transferring unwanted and invasive species to a new location. Images of Invasive Non-Native Species are available on the GB Non-native Species Secretariat website and on Flickr"

/government/news/fish-stocks-boost-for-bedfordshire-rivers,"Fisheries experts are giving a boost to fish stocks in Bedfordshire to help develop and restore rivers and lakes. Fish stocks boost for Bedfordshire Rivers Fisheries and rod licensing Environment Agency Fisheries experts are giving a boost to fish stocks in Bedfordshire waters as part of the Environment Agency’s ongoing plans to develop and restore rivers and lakes. Fisheries teams are stocking 2,600 barbel at several locations today (8 December). At the River Ivel near Biggleswade and Blunham, 800 young fish will be stocked, and a further 1,800 released in the Upper Ouse, distributed between Newport Pagnell, Odell, Harold and Adams Mill, Gayhurst. Environment Agency fisheries teams have been working hard to improve river habitats for fish and other wildlife, with particular attention to spawning beds, water quality and improved fish passage. Alex Malcolm, Fisheries Officer at the Environment Agency, said: We are pleased that we can provide these fish for stocking as part of our commitment to rod licence paying anglers. Restoration and the creation of new fisheries for all people to enjoy, is a very important aspect to our work. Work to improve river habitat has also been carried out recently at Adams Mill, Gayhurst. Fisheries officers have been carrying out gravel jetting projects which involves forcing water into the gravel beds at high pressure using a water pump. This removes any silt from spawning beds, improving water and oxygen flow over the fish eggs during spawning times, which increases survival rates. Several flow deflectors have also been installed upstream of the gravel beds to help keep them clean, and a large section of the bank has been reinforced using branches from nearby felled trees to help prevent erosion. The Environment Agency releases fish into our waterways annually. Fisheries officers target fish stocking activity using data from national fish surveys to identify where there are problems with poor breeding and survival. The fish all come from the Environment Agency’s fish farm at Calverton, in Nottinghamshire, where between 350,000 and 500,000 fish are produced to stock rivers across the country each year. The young fish are reared for just over a year in a purpose built facility to ensure they’re super fit and healthy when they’re stocked. The fish farm is funded by Anglers rod licence fees."

/government/news/fish-population-boost-for-kent,"Fish populations across Kent have been boosted thanks to an Environment Agency re-stocking project. Fish population boost for Kent  Environment Agency Environment Agency fisheries officers restocked over 7,000 fish, including dace, chub, roach, and barbel, in the River Medway near Barming and the Greater Stour near Ashford. 6,000 of the fish were added to the Greater Stour to boost the population after a significant fish kill. The fish came from the Environment Agency’s fish farm in Calverton, which is funded by rod licensing. Around 1,000 barbel and chub were added to the River Medway near Barming for scientific reasons. The Medway fish were tagged with a blue dye which will allow the Environment Agency to monitor their progress. Anglers in the area can send information to Environment Agency when they catch the fish and help determine how best to protect fish populations in future. Joe Kitanosono, Environment Agency fisheries officer said: It’s great that we have been able to restock fish in Kent. The restocking of fish in the Stour will hopefully kick start the fish population following the devastating effects of a pollution incident. By using a blue marking system on the fish at Barming we are able to track the progress of fishes and focus habitat alterations where appropriate. All income from rod licence sales is used to fund our work to protect and improve fish stocks and fisheries. This includes improving habitats for fish and facilities for anglers, tackling illegal fishing and working with partners to encourage people to give fishing a go.

The Aylesford community has a long and frequent flood history. The scheme to reduce flood risk from fluvial flooding and surface water flooding has been funded in partnership by the Environment Agency and Kent County Council at a total cost of over £250,000. Property-level protection measures will provide the most effective form of flood defence to the properties within flood zone 3. These measures include self-sealing doors, air brick covers and non-return valves to drains. Whilst the Environment Agency installed the measures, they are now the property owner’s responsibility. The Environment Agency has worked closely with the community during the project, giving the residents and business owners options in terms of appearance and design of measures and ensuring the protection fits in with the character of the residential roads. Simon Curd, Flood Risk Team Leader said: We have been heavily engaged with the Aylesford community since 2009 and have had public meetings to explain this property level protection scheme.

This could lead to potential enforcement action after further investigation. Lesley Robertson, Enforcement Team Leader from the Environment Agency said: We want to protect people and communities from the impact that illegally transported and disposed of waste can have, thereby creating a level playing field for legitimate operators. To help us, we encourage people to check with the Environment Agency first to make sure the company or person they use to take their waste away is registered.

The company was sentenced at Leeds Crown Court on Tuesday 19 January after pleading guilty to one charge of causing a water discharge that was not authorised by an environmental permit. Yorkshire Water was also ordered to pay investigation and prosecution costs of £24,000 to the Environment Agency, which brought the prosecution following a pollution incident at Walton Colliery Nature Park in October 2013. At an earlier hearing, the court heard that sometime on or before 5 October 2013 a rising main sewage pipe from the company’s Shay Lane pumping station burst and raw sewage flowed into Drain Beck, which feeds a fishing lake in Walton Park which itself flows into the Barnsley Canal. Over the following days more than 860 dead fish were removed from the lake and the canal, which are stocked by the Walton Angling Club. Many more fish were either eaten by gulls or sank to the bottom of the deep lake, so the exact number of fish killed is not known. Water samples confirmed that the pollution was significant enough to be fatal to aquatic life. In April 2014, a survey found that the main lake and canal were almost devoid of fish. The survey concluded that restoration would take many years. In March 2015 the lake had sufficiently recovered for a restocking programme to begin, paid for by Yorkshire Water, but it will be a number of years before the fishery recovers to its pre-incident condition. The court heard that there had been four bursts on this rising main in the previous two years, and on each occasion Yorkshire Water had put the failure down to age deterioration of the pipe. His Honour Judge Kearl QC found that the company had been negligent and the incident had caused significant pollution. The company was given full credit for its guilty plea and its response to the incident. The rising main has now been replaced. Mark West, environment management team leader at the Environment Agency, said after the case: Utility companies have a responsibility to properly manage their infrastructure and ensure that their operations do not put the environment at unnecessary risk. This pollution incident had a significant impact on the ecology of the lake and the canal and it could have been avoided had the company taken action to replace the pipe following earlier bursts. Aside from the devastating loss of fish, this incident has had an impact on the lake that will last for some time. The angling club has also lost a significant amount of income during the time that the lake has been out of use. They’ve only recently been able to start fishing there again."

/government/news/negligent-ampthill-recycling-centre-director-to-pay-33000,"Woods Recycling Services director Simon Lupson was yesterday sentenced for waste permit breaches at a site which burned for days at the end of February 2013. Negligent Ampthill recycling centre director to pay £33,000  Environment Agency In a case brought by the Environment Agency, Luton Crown Court heard that neighbours of the site in Ampthill suffered from smells and dust for more than a year. Local residents and workers said the smell - like rotting rubbish - and dust had affected their lives. The smells made some people want to retch and be sick and some with asthma were affected by it. Judge Philip Bartle fined Lupson £3,000 and ordered him to pay a contribution to prosecution costs of £30,000 after he pleaded guilty to the offences on the second day of a trial listed for 3 weeks. Abuse hearing won The Environment Agency had also earlier won an abuse of process argument and an application to exclude evidence both lodged by Lupson in 2014. The permit for the site in Station Road, Ampthill allowed the company to recycle and store degradable household, commercial and industrial wastes. But a number of conditions were breached covering odour, dust, and site drainage on numerous dates in 2011 to 2013. Mr Sailesh Mehta, prosecuting counsel, said there had been a continuous impact on local residents and businesses and the amenity of the area. He said Lupson was involved in WRS since it began, as company secretary and then as director. He knew about complaints to the Environment Agency and made promises when things got difficult. “He knew exactly what the problems were but carried on.” WRS failed to properly manage the risks and failed to follow its own internal procedures. Although there were some site-working plans and dust and odour management plans they were either not followed or were inadequate. Failed to take action The company continued to take waste when there was too much already on site resulting in waste biodegrading causing more leachate, mud, dust, smell and litter. Mr Mehta said Lupson ran the business in a way that could undercut legitimate business. The Environment Agency advised the company and its director to take action but they failed to. Calls to the Environment Agency hotline from people living or working nearby complained of smells and dust impacting on their daily lives and businesses. Judge Philip Bartle said the company was ‘hopelessly underfunded’ but Lupson was more concerned with financial profit. He said: “I’m sure Lupson continued this company without regard to the conditions of this permit. He did assist from time to time……. but things got completely out of hand and he lost control.” The judge gave credit for Lupson’s guilty plea and took into account that he had no previous convictions. Site cleared He said he based the fine on the circumstances of the offences and Lupson’s finances. Since the offences, the site has been cleared and the company has gone into voluntary liquidation. After the hearing Environment Agency officer Jeremy Hay said: “Everyone who deals with waste has a duty of care to ensure their waste is handled correctly. We provided plenty of advice and guidance but unfortunately this was ignored. As a consequence local businesses and residents were badly affected by dust and odours. Waste continued to be brought onto the site despite not having the capacity to deal with it effectively “Wood Recycling took so much waste on to the site that it overflowed onto nearby land illegally. The company failed to follow its own procedures having a massive impact on local residents and businesses and the amenity of the area.”"

Lower Thames strategy  Environment Agency The Lower Thames Flood Risk Management Strategy ( LTFRMS ) proposes measures to reduce the risk of flooding to the 15,000 properties which are currently at risk from a 1% flood event in the area from Datchet to Teddington. These measures include the construction of three flood diversion channels, the widening of Desborough Cut and improvements to Sunbury and Molesey Weirs and Teddington Lock. It also includes community based measures for improving resistance and resilience to flooding for smaller groups of properties and improving mapping information for emergency evacuation plans. The proposed LTFRMS was launched for public consultation from 21 September 2009 to 18 December 2009. Public exhibitions and meetings were held during this period with the main aim being to present the strategy and to ask people living and working in the area what they thought about it. We received over 800 responses from individuals and organisations, and over 1400 people attended the public exhibitions and meetings. There was widespread support for the proposed strategy."
/government/news/car-scrap-business-owner-fined-by-court,"A Cornish man who operated an illegal car-breaking business in St Cleer and Bodmin has been ordered to pay £5,484 in fines and costs. Car scrap business owner fined by court  Environment Agency The court heard that the sites used by James Darke, for his JapScrap company over a 2-year period, were ‘unsightly with a clear risk of pollution’. The case was brought by the Environment Agency. Darke, of The Sidings, Bugle, was fined after pleading guilty to depositing, keeping and breaking waste vehicles at Unit C, South West Business Park, St Cleer, without an environmental permit between 5 July and 9 September 2013, and at 11, Paardeberg Road, Bodmin, between 20 March 2014 and 20 March 2015. The Environment Agency told the court that the permits were designed to ensure that people managing waste sites did so without having an adverse impact on the environment or community. All car breaking locations require environmental permits as the activity poses a significant risk to the environment, even on a small scale. In June 2013, an Environment Agency officer received a report of illegal car breaking at St Cleer and found that there were no environmental permits or exemptions for the location. Further investigation found that the site was breaking up cars without a permit and selling the parts on-line. Much of the advertising and marketing of the business was done via Facebook. The operator was first provided with advice and guidance on how to legitimately operate his business. James Darke admitted the offences to the Environment Agency, agreeing to either comply or cease to trade. He was offered a caution but did not respond and further investigation in March 2014 showed he had moved to the Bodmin site and was carrying out a similar business on this site. Darke was given a final chance to accept a caution in January 2015, but did not respond. The Environment Agency said the offences had been deliberate and driven by financial motives. A spokesperson for the Environment Agency said: Darke was aware, after the first investigation, of what was required. He did not respond to the formal caution offer and simply relocated his car breaking business and carried on, without a permit, until caught again. Breaking vehicles without an environmental permit poses significant risk of pollution, and Darke had ignored several warnings, and then moved from one site to another. He admitted 2 offences of operating a regulated facility of depositing, keeping and breaking waste vehicles without an environmental permit, contrary to regulations 12(1)(a) and 38(1)(a) Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) regulations 2010. Darke was fined £640 and ordered to pay a £64 victim surcharge and £4,780 costs by Bodmin magistrates."
/government/news/fish-stocks-boost-for-darlington-waters,"Thousands of fish stocked in North East rivers. Fish stocks boost for Darlington waters  Environment Agency Fisheries experts have stocked thousands of fish at Darlington as part of the Environment Agency’s ongoing plans to develop and restore watercourses. The River Tees above Broken Scar saw 1,000 barbel, 2,000 dace and 2,000 chub stocked on Monday 1 February. A further 3,000 Dace were released into Clow Beck, near Aldbrough St John, and the River Skerne at South Park on Tuesday 2 February. The Environment Agency releases fish into our waterways annually. Fisheries officers target fish stocking activity using data from national fish surveys to identify where there are problems with poor breeding and survival. Environment Agency North East Fisheries Officer, Paul Frear, introduced the fish to their new homes this week. He said: We’re pleased that we can provide these fish for stocking as part of our commitment to rod licence paying anglers. Restoration and the creation of new fisheries for all people to enjoy is a very important aspect to our work. High spring flows and cool summers on the River Tees has impacted on coarse fish survival along with barriers to fish passage, so the Environment Agency stocks fish to help support it. The Clow Beck was badly polluted last year and thousands of fish were killed. This stocking is part of the restoration and a concerted effort by the Environment Agency is helping to turn this watercourse around. The fish for stocking all come from the Environment Agency’s fish farm at Calverton, in Nottinghamshire, where between 350,000 and 500,000 fish are produced to stock rivers across the country each year."
/government/news/flood-warning-siren-test-at-north-east-community-event,"Demonstrations of sirens at flood defences at Skinningrove. Flood Warning siren test at north east community event  Environment Agency A community event which will include a live Flood Warning Siren test and a demonstration of new flood defences will take place next month. The Environment Agency and partners including Cleveland Emergency Planning Unit and Redcar and Cleveland Borough Council will host the event on Wednesday 17 February 2016 at the Riverside Building in Skinningrove. The event is to help the community be better prepared for flooding. During the event there will be demonstrations of the new flood defences, a review of current plans and procedures as well as some half-term fun for the family. The demonstrations will include a live test of the Skinningrove Flood Warning Siren at around 1.30pm. The flood defences in the village have been upgraded in a project completed in September 2015, meaning the bridge parapets at Zetland Row now lower automatically at the push of a button, rather than having to be lowered manually. It significantly reduces the time needed to ensure the flood gates are closed and parapets are lowered when river levels are high. Alex Haley, from the Environment Agency’s Flood Resilience team in the North East, said: The event is aimed at increasing awareness in the village about the work the Environment Agency has done to protect the community, including the improved flood defences. It’s also to help residents understand how to prepare for a flood and the important role of volunteers, such as Flood Wardens, and how vital it is to have a Communtiy Action Plan so residents know how to respond. Councillor Helen McLuckie, Cabinet Member for Neighbourhoods at Redcar & Cleveland Borough Council, added: I would urge as many people in the local community as possible to come down and attend this event. Everyone has their part to play during flooding emergencies and good preparation can make all the difference in the aftermath of flooding. It is also a good opportunity to learn more about what the council, and its partner agencies, are doing to alleviate the risk of flooding in Skinningrove. The day will also include a drop in session promoting Floodline Warnings Direct sign up, recruitment of Flood Wardens and volunteers to promote community resilience. Check to see if free flood warnings are available in your community and sign up by calling Floodline on 0345 988 1188 or by visiting the website. For further details on the community event call the Environment Agency’s Flood Resilience team on 0191 203 4333. The event is subject to weather conditions and any ongoing incidents involving the organisations involved. Skinningrove suffered flooding from the Kilton Beck on two occasions in 2000, and then again due to surface water in 2013."
/government/news/village-channel-clearance-reduces-flood-risk,"The Environment Agency has joined forces with The Skill Mill to reduce the risk of flooding in a Northumberland village Village channel clearance reduces flood risk  Environment Agency The Environment Agency has joined forces with social enterprise The Skill Mill to carry out work to reduce the risk of flooding in a Northumberland village. They cleared silt which had built up over the years from the side of the channel through Wark, in Tynedale. It means the capacity of the channel is increased and can take more water, improving the flow and ensuring water passes through the culvert more easily. The pre-planned work took place last week. Ian Doughty, Field Operations Team Leader for the Environment Agency in the North East, said: We carry out regular work across the North East to ensure rivers and watercourses are free from obstructions which might increase the risk of flooding. The planned work which took place in Wark last week saw the capacity of the channel increased and silt which was restricting the flow through the culvert removed, reducing the risk of flooding. We regularly work closely with The Skill Mill ensuring they get vital work experience in the field. The Skill Mill is a social enterprise providing employment for young people in watercourse and horticultural services. The Environment Agency works with the team regularly. Skill Mill Director David Parks added: The Skill Mill Team has benefited greatly from working alongside the Environment Agency Field Teams over the past two years. There has been a real camaraderie and willingness to share expertise and help the young employees learn new skills. The work at Wark has been another excellent example of this co-working and how much can be achieved when we join forces. It also goes to show that The Skill Mill team isn’t afraid of a bit of muck!"
/government/news/company-fined-for-illegal-waste-offences,"A South Devon company has been ordered to pay £15,760.10 in fines and costs for storing waste including hazardous asbestos roof tiles at an unlicensed site.  Company fined for illegal waste offences  Environment Agency The case was brought by the Environment Agency. Armabridge Ltd waste operates 2 businesses from separate sites in Torquay. They include a top soil supply business at Kerswell Garden Centre known as ‘Topsoil Torbay’ and a waste transfer station and skip business at Barton Hill Way trading as ‘Skip-it’. On 6 June 2014 Environment Agency officers found suspicious piles of waste at the Kerswell Garden Centre site. Closer inspection showed it was screened or sieved waste known as ‘fines’. Samples of the waste were later analysed and found to contain hazardous materials including asbestos. The managing director of Armabridge Ltd admitted tipping some of the screened waste, but disputed the suggestion his company was responsible for all of the illegal waste deposited. In an interview under caution he admitted using the Kerswell Gardens site to process waste to avoid high landfill charges. Samples taken by the Environment Agency from the site were found to contain elevated levels of antimony, sulphate, organic carbon and total dissolved solids at levels that would still have resulted in the waste being classified as non-inert irrespective of the presence of asbestos. Environment Agency officers estimated that approximately 2,600 tonnes of hazardous waste (due to the prescence of asbestos) had been deposited at the Kerswell Garden Centre site that was only licensed to accept inert wastes. Problems were also discovered at the company’s waste transfer station at Barton Hill Way earlier in 2014 where there was considered to be a risk of waste run-off entering surface water drainage systems and contaminating the surrounding environment. A large pile of mixed waste was also being stored outside the permitted area in close proximity to an electrical sub-station. Armabridge Ltd was asked to address these problems, but when Environment Agency officers carried out a follow-up inspection on 3 June 2014 no action had been taken. The company’s failure to comply with the conditions of its site permit resulted in the Environment Agency issuing Armabridge Ltd with an Enforcement Notice on 10 July 2014. The site remained largely unchanged when it was next inspected in October 2014. Inadequate measures had been taken to prevent contaminated water from entering surface water drainage and the large pile of waste stored outside the permitted area was still in place. Jacob Hess for the Environment Agency said: In our opinion this defendant found a cheap way to dispose of waste, but in saving money the company failed to take the necessary steps to protect the environment. Although the asbestos was mainly in a bonded form, any movement or treatment of this waste without proper controls in place may have lead to the release and spread of asbestos fibres putting the environment at further risk. Inadequate infrastructure and storage of waste at the waste transfer site meant that site operations posed an immediate risk to the local environment. Appearing before Torquay magistrates Armabridge Ltd of Torquay was fined £6,000 and ordered to pay £9,640.10 costs after pleading guilty to 3 offences under the Environmental Permitting Regulations (2010) and Environmental Protection Act (1990) including operating a regulated facility without permit and failing to comply with 2 enforcement notices. The company was fined £2,000 for each offence. The case was heard on 26 January 2016."
/government/news/almost-2-million-fish-released-into-englands-rivers,"Record-breaking results for Environment Agency’s fish breeding farm Almost 2 million fish released into England’s rivers  Environment Agency Record-breaking numbers of coarse fish were released into England’s rivers in 2015, the Environment Agency has revealed. Last year was the best year ever for the Environment Agency’s specialist fish breeding farm in Nottingham. Experts stocked more than 452,220 fish and 1.3 million larvae into rivers all over the country. They were all bred at the Environment Agency’s Calverton fish farm. Calverton is the Environment Agency’s principal supply of coarse fish for restocking. Every year for the last 31 years the farm has produced up to 450,000 fish of nine species for restocking into rivers following pollution incidents or to help restore fish stocks in rivers where numbers are low. All of its work is funded by rod licence income. Fish farm team leader Alan Henshaw said: Many of our industrialised rivers have improved dramatically in water quality in the last 30 years and concerted restocking from Calverton has accelerated the restoration of natural fish stocks and viable fisheries. Last year was no exception and, while it wasn’t a good summer for getting a tan, it was perfect for growing fish. Growth and production rates of fish that have been grown on the farm for 18 months have been the highest recorded at Calverton. Many rivers and lakes throughout England have benefited from these stockings and the quality of the fish is a testament to the hard work and professionalism of the staff. Some notable stockings that took place include: 2,800 Barbel across the Great Ouse and 1,000 into the River Nene in Anglian region. 19,000 mixed Chub, Dace, Barbel and Roach across the River Sow and River Tame in the Midlands. 14,500 mixed Chub, Dace, Bream, and Barbel into the Yorkshire Derwent. 7,000 mixed Barbel and Chub into the River Tees in the North East. 9,000 mixed Chub, Dace and Roach into the River Alt in the North West. 28,500 mixed Bream and Rudd into Birchmere Lake in London. 32,700 mixed Chub, Roach, Barbel and Bream across the River Brue and River Sheppey in the South West. The fish breeding process is complex. Staff at Calverton remove the sperm and eggs by hand from the fish and the eggs are treated with a solution to improve the rate of fertilisation. They are then laid out in specialist trays and placed inside troughs, where they receive a fresh, temperature controlled water supply. The eggs are incubated for between three and 30 days depending on species and temperature. When the eggs have hatched, the tiny larvae start feeding on minute Brine Shrimp. After a few weeks they are stocked into the onsite ponds until they are ready to be released into the wild. The process takes approximately 18 months from the egg stage to releasing the young fish into the wild. In 2015 the number of each species released was: Chub 53,729 Dace 46,850 Roach 67,875 Bream 66,976 Barbel 58,400 Tench 15,231 Crucians 88,034 Rudd 35,125 Grayling 20,000"

/government/news/scrapyard-boss-given-suspended-prison-sentence,"Wiltshire scrapyard and recycling company owner receives a prison sentence for running an illegal waste site in Melksham. Scrapyard boss given suspended prison sentence  Environment Agency The owner of a Wiltshire scrapyard and recycling company has received an 18 month prison sentence suspended for 2 years for running an illegal waste operation from a site in Melksham. The case was brought by the Environment Agency. Lee Hazel, owner and director of Melksham Metals Recycling Ltd, was sentenced yesterday at Swindon Crown Court following 2 earlier court hearings in June 2014 and November 2015. On 23 August 2011 an enforcement officer from Wiltshire Council visited the Lowbourne area of Melksham to investigate a report of illegal waste tipping. He found piles of chalky stone, tarmac road planings and concrete pipes on land at Queenfield Farm beside the old Wiltshire to Berkshire Canal. The officer reported the incident to the Environment Agency. At the entrance to Queenfield Farm he noticed a trail of ‘chalky liquid’ in the road similar in colour to the waste stone he had seen tipped at the farm. He followed the trail back into Melksham to a road leading to Melksham Metal Recycling. On 6 September 2011 Environment Agency officers visited Queenfield Farm where they saw a Melksham Metals lorry loaded with stone waste drive onto the site. In addition to stone waste tipped at the site, waste transfer ‘fines’ were also seen. These fines are small particles of waste resulting from a screening process. Following the visit, the Environment Agency wrote to Lee Hazel at Melksham Metals asking him to provide copies of waste transfer notes for the previous 2 years. Lee Hazel claimed the lorry seen at Queenfield Farm on 6 September was taking stone waste to a permitted site near Chippenham. This contradicted what his driver had told Environment Agency officers. Mr Hazel claimed he had never tipped waste at the farm. Further inquiries revealed that Melksham Metals had a contract to remove waste stone from a local stone masons yard for disposal at a licensed site. When an Environment Agency officer visited the yard he saw cut pieces of stone identical to the stone waste he’d seen at Queenfield Farm. A court heard Melksham Metals was paid nearly £178,000 to remove waste from the stone masons yard between November 2004 and May 2012. The Environment Agency had warned Lee Hazel on several occasions about unlawful waste activities including the illegal disposal of waste at Queenfield Farm and depositing waste on land without an environmental permit and the requirements of duty of care. Lee Hazel had been involved in the waste industry for 20 years and held a Certificate of Technical Competence (CoTC) by the Waste Management Industry Training and Advisory Board (WAMITAB). An Environment Agency spokesperson said: It is important waste materials are stored, handled and disposed of correctly to protect the environment and safeguard human health. The defendant in this case continued to operate outside the law despite being put on notice that what he was doing was illegal and ran the risk of prosecution. In June 2014 Lee Hazel was found guilty of 4 charges in relation to the dumping of waste on land at Queenfield Farm, Melksham. In November 2015 Lee Hazel pleaded guilty to a further 5 charges in relation to unauthorised waste activities at his Station Yard premises. Melksham Metals Recycling Ltd was also convicted of similar offences, but will not be sentenced until after a confiscation hearing in June 2016. This hearing will decide the financial benefit obtained by Lee Hazel and make a confiscation order in relation to that benefit. Fines and costs against both Lee Hazel and his company will also be decided at that hearing. [Contact:144]"

/government/news/volunteers-needed-to-help-protect-st-thomas-residents-from-floods,"An Exeter community group is looking for volunteers to help protect local people from flooding.  Volunteers needed to help protect St Thomas residents from floods  Environment Agency St Thomas Community Emergency Group aims to have a flood warden in every street to help warn and support vulnerable residents in the event of a flood. The group is currently working on a community emergency plan with the Environment Agency. It is also helping businesses in St Thomas and Marsh Barton prepare for floods. Currently only a handful people have come forward as volunteers, but the group needs more. Flood warden training will take place on Saturday 12 March, at Exeter Fire Station, Dane’s Castle. The enhancement of Exeter’s flood defences means that the likelihood of flooding has reduced. However, should a flood occur the impact in St Thomas would be high. During March and April the group will practice their emergency response in St Thomas. They will be joined by the Environment Agency and Devon Fire and Rescue service who will provide training and support. Jane Fletcher-Peters, flood resilience adviser for the Environment Agency, said: Exeter St Thomas is at a very high risk of flash flooding from surface water. Following a period of sustained, intense rainfall, there’s potential for deep, fast flowing surface water to flood St Thomas. This type of flooding can happen suddenly with little warning. This is due to the speed at which the surface water would run off the steep valley sides to the west of St Thomas. Although this type of flooding is very rare, the consequences can be quite severe. Deep, fast flowing water has a lot of force. Surface water flooding happens when rainwater does not drain away. Either through the normal drainage systems or soak into the ground. It lies on or flows over the ground instead, before it enters a watercourse or drain. It’s associated with intense rainfall events. It happens when rainwater falls at a faster rate than the ground can absorb it rather than because a watercourse has overtopped its banks. Water flows across the land and puddles and ponds. This means that surface water flooding can happen many miles from a river. Often in places that people wouldn’t expect. It happens simply because there’s nowhere for the rain to go. Dave Hubbard, Coordinator for the St Thomas Community Emergency Group, said: When complete, the improvements to the Exeter flood defence scheme will reduce flood risk to large parts of St Thomas from the River Exe, however, the risk of surface water flooding will remain. Extreme flash floods from surface water are rare, but it’s important for the community to be aware, take action and be prepared. We need more active members and flood wardens.

Note to editors: Exeter St Thomas is one of 52 communities in the South West at a very high risk of flash flooding. How can I prepare for flooding? View the Environment Agency’s flood map to check if your home or businesses is at risk of flooding. Learn how to protect your home, family and possessions, using the 3 steps to safety: be aware - you are likely to have little or no warning never risk your life - do not walk or drive through flood water get to safety - understand where to go if you get caught in a flash flood Step 1 - be aware People generally underestimate the risk to their safety. Flash flooding happens very suddenly: it may flood before emergency services arrive rivers may flood to heights above defences watch for signs that a river or stream is about to flood. It may be fast flowing. Its water may be discoloured and contain debris listen for weather warnings on the radio and TV Step 2 - never risk your life Most injuries and deaths caused during a flash flood happen when people try to cross a watercourse on foot or in a vehicle. Never underestimate the danger of water: it only takes 15cm (6 inches) of fast flowing water to knock over an adult there may be hidden dangers in the water including rubble, vegetation and exposed drains it only takes 60cm (2 feet) of water to lift and sweep away a 4x4 car or small lorry Step 3 - get to safety Attempting to leave the area may not necessarily be the best thing to do in a flash flood. If you know where to move to in a flash flood you are more likely to stay safe. if possible move to a higher storey stay where you are and wait for instructions from the emergency services if you are considering evacuation, think about how close you are to the flooding and if you can move without walking or driving through flood water identify safe routes away from the likely location of flash flooding If you are in a vulnerable place or get caught outside: seek shelter in the nearest two-storey (or higher) building or go to higher ground call 999 if you are trapped Acting now and planning what you would do in the event of a flood could minimise the potential damage and distress that flooding causes."

Timber and other floating debris can accumulate against the central pier of Low Bridge, situated on the western edge of the town, and if left unchecked this mass could eventually grow large enough to block the bridge’s arches. It is estimated that there is up to 15 tonnes of debris which has been washed downstream following the flooding at Christmas. An operations team from the Environment Agency will remove the debris, using chainsaws to cut up the branches, from a boat in the river. Any large pieces of debris will then be lifted by a crane into a wagon on the bridge. The work has been scheduled for a Sunday to minimise disruption to road traffic. The one-day operation will mean a temporary road closure of the B6163 Knaresborough to Calcutt road, in co-operation with North Yorkshire County Council. Pedestrians will still be able to use the road. Andrew Gannaway, in the operations delivery team at the Environment Agency, said: This operation is part of the Environment Agency’s ongoing recovery work following the floods at Christmas, to reduce the risk of flooding to people and properties. Clearing the debris at Low Bridge is quite an important job because it can and does accumulate against the central pier of the bridge, and if it isn’t removed it would eventually block the water flow underneath the bridge arches. It usually needs to be done every two years. If anyone notices any debris or obstructions in their local river, please report it to the Environment Agency’s incident hotline on 0800 80 70 60."

The one-day operation will mean a temporary road closure of the B6163 Knaresborough to Calcutt road, in co-operation with North Yorkshire County Council. Pedestrians will still be able to use the road. Andrew Gannaway, in the operations delivery team at the Environment Agency, said: This operation is part of the Environment Agency’s ongoing recovery work following the floods at Christmas, to reduce the risk of flooding to people and properties. Clearing the debris at Low Bridge is quite an important job because it can and does accumulate against the central pier of the bridge, and if it isn’t removed it would eventually block the water flow underneath the bridge arches. It usually needs to be done every two years. If anyone notices any debris or obstructions in their local river, please report it to the Environment Agency’s incident hotline on 0800 80 70 60."

/government/news/castleford-firm-fined-9000-over-housing-development-pollution,"Silt-polluted water ran from construction site into watercourse Castleford firm fined £9,000 over housing development pollution  Environment Agency A Castleford engineering firm has been fined £9,000 over a pollution incident relating to a housing development in Huddersfield. Flannery Civil Engineering Ltd, of Willow Bridge Way, Castleford, appeared before Kirklees Magistrates’ Court on Monday 14 March following a pollution incident at Lindley Park, Huddersfield, in November 2013. The company admitted one environmental offence for an unauthorised discharge of water, containing silt and sediment, from the construction site into a nearby watercourse that runs into Grimescar Dyke. Miller Homes Ltd, of Edinburgh, also appeared before Kirklees magistrates today to admit a similar charge for its involvement in the same incident. Miller Homes will be sentenced at Leeds Crown Court on Monday 11 April. Prosecuting for the Environment Agency, Chris Bunting told the court that the polluted water should have been managed on the construction site, and that neither company had permission to discharge silt water from the site. Miller Homes contracted Flannery to construct four storage lagoons in order to reduce the risk of flooding downstream. Straw bales were used on the outflow of the lower lagoon to prevent silt from leaving the site. But following heavy rainfall in November 2013, the lower lagoon filled with water, and Flannery removed the straw bales to allow it to drain. With the bales removed, silt water ran directly into the watercourse, affecting water quality. A member of the public reported the pollution incident to the Environment Agency, which sent an officer to investigate. He found that the watercourse was running a dark brown colour, and traced the source back to the development site. The officer also saw that the straw bales were situated at the side of the lagoon, no longer filtering the discharge. Water entering the top lagoon was clear, but the water leaving the bottom lagoon was cloudy. Mr Bunting told the court that, although straw bales were used on construction sites for sediment filtering, they weren’t ideal because they require regular inspection and maintenance. When interviewed, the companies gave conflicting answers to questions about responsibility for monitoring the lagoons. In court, Flannery stated that they undertook visual inspections. A spokesperson for the Environment Agency, said after the case: “Construction sites of any kind can have a detrimental impact on the environment. Silt and sediment in particular is a very common problem - that’s why it is vital that construction companies take their environmental responsibilities seriously and ensure that effective pollution prevention is planned into every development at an early stage. “Silt and sediment can coat the bed of a watercourse and damage the habitat of aquatic insects and similar. These are an important part of the ecosystem, providing food for fish and other higher species. “If anyone sees any pollution in a watercourse, please report it to our incident hotline on 0800 807060 so we can investigate.” In mitigation, Flannery apologised to the court, and accepted they had been negligent by failing to have measures in place to cope with an overfilling lagoon. In 42 years of trading they had no previous convictions. The company was also ordered to pay £2,415.03 in costs."
/government/news/men-reported-for-illegal-fishing-in-northumberland,"Environment Agency and police officers respond to tip-off Men reported for illegal fishing in Northumberland  Environment Agency Two men have been reported for summons for illegal fishing in Northumberland. Environment Agency officers received a report of men fishing without a licence near to Wylam Bridge at around 6pm on Monday, March 14. They attended with the support of Northumbria Police officers. Two of the men – aged 43 and 38 - were subsequently reported for summons for illegal fishing. Three fishing rods and other associated equipment were seized. Officers from the Environment Agency will also be out patrolling north east rivers from the Tees to the Coquet this weekend on the look-out for anglers fishing illegally. Anglers are being reminded that fishing for coarse fish in rivers is off limits until June 16 and anyone caught fishing illegally can expect to be prosecuted and face a fine. The three-month break from March 15 is designed to protect breeding fish. The Environment Agency team will also be ensuring those fishing in the many lakes, ponds and canals where coarse fishing is still allowed have a valid rod licence. And they’ll be on the look-out for those using illegal baits, and banned methods of fishing and fishing in prohibited areas. The Environment Agency’s Fisheries Technical Specialist in the North East, Kevin Summerson, said: We take reports of illegal fishing seriously and work closely with police and local angling clubs to take action where appropriate. We’ll continue to target all aspects of illegal fishing activity. Anyone discovered committing offences could face a substantial fine at court. All income from rod licence sales is used to fund Environment Agency work to protect and improve fish stocks and fisheries, including improving habitats for fish and facilities for anglers, tackling illegal fishing and working with partners to encourage people to give fishing a go. Buying a rod licence is quick and easy - you can buy them online at the Post Office . The Environment Agency urges anyone to report illegal fishing by calling 0800 80 70 60."
/government/news/calling-all-lovers-of-the-river-thames-to-join-our-volunteers,"The Environment Agency is once again looking for new recruits to join its growing band of volunteers on the non-tidal River Thames.   Calling all lovers of the River Thames to join our volunteers!  Environment Agency Rising near Cirencester in Gloucestershire and tracing a glistening, serpentine route through some of the most gorgeous countryside that England’s home counties have to offer, the freshwater River Thames is an irresistible source of recreational pleasure for walkers, runners, cyclists, anglers and boaters ‘messing about’ on every type of vessel imaginable. It is the vital and highly valued service it provides boaters and other users and visitors to its locks that the Environment Agency is seeking help with. Demetri Somarakis, who manages the Environment Agency’s River Thames Volunteers Team said: The service we provide boaters on the Thames is unrivalled by any other river in the world. Our ability to maintain such high standards relies on the significant contribution of our volunteers. They give up their spare time to work under the expert guidance of our full-time professional staff, and do so full of enthusiasm and friendliness. We, and the rest of river’s boating fraternity, are hugely appreciative and we look forward to welcoming back many of our veterans and hopefully lots of new faces to our locks this season. Peter Le Gros who volunteers at Hurley Lock near Maidenhead in Berkshire said: I used to fish here as a boy, and coming back now that I’ve retired to help boaters is a great fun. The scheme is very well run and it’s lovely being out in the fresh air – it’s a really lovely thing to do. Sandy Jeffrey from Woodcote, Oxfordshire, works at Goring Lock, also in Berkshire, and said: I popped down to the lock for an ice cream one day and the next thing I know I’ve been volunteering here for four years! I love coming on the lock, because the people are so lovely. As a lady volunteer, I share lots of jokes and giggles about the men with women boaters – of which there are quite a few – and they like seeing a woman on the lock. So, more lady volunteers please! The Environment Agency is looking for people to offer at least one day per week working at one or more locks of their choice from the 45 that the Environment Agency operates along the 135 miles of non-tidal River Thames. They run from St John’s near Lechlade in Gloucestershire, through Oxfordshire, Berkshire and Surrey to Teddington in south west London Most sit within sumptuously beautiful pastoral landscapes, but others are in more urban settings, where they provide a small oasis of tranquillity amongst the hustle and bustle of metropolitan life. And though there are opportunities at every lock, the Environment Agency is particularly keen for more people to work at some of the more remote sites in Oxfordshire – arguably some of the most attractive and serene. John Stevenson from Woodstock, Oxfordshire has been volunteering at one such lock in Eynsham near Witney since 2013. He said: I absolutely love it! I work at one of the traditional beam locks, which have to be worked by hand, and it’s a great way to stay fit – far better than going to the gym! The people you meet are always in a happy mood and the camaraderie is marvellous. I just don’t want to give it up. I thoroughly recommend it! The Environment Agency provides training, workwear and travel expenses. The river environment and the people who use and enjoy it provide everything else volunteers gain from the experience.

/government/news/illegal-fishing-crackdown-in-the-north-east,"Environment Agency officers reported 12 people for 23 offences in a crackdown on illegal fishing during the first week of close season.  Illegal fishing crackdown in the North East  Environment Agency Between March 15 and 21, officers patrolling river banks reported 2 unlicensed fishing offences, 3 for failing to produce a current licence, 11 offences of fishing for either coarse fish or trout in close season, and 7 offences of using illegal bait. It’s currently the close season for coarse fishing, which means fishing on rivers, streams and some canals and stillwaters is not permitted. This is done to protect breeding fish, helping to safeguard stocks for the future. The season for brown trout opened on March 22. Six of the 12 people reported for offences were on the River Tees, 5 on the River Derwent and one on a stillwater in Northumberland. The action follows 2 men being reported for illegal fishing at Wylam on March 14. Dave Edwardson, Enforcement Team Leader at the Environment Agency in the North East, said: “The Environment Agency carries out enforcement work all year round, but the close season is particularly important to allow fish time to breed and spawn. “Our work is intelligence-led, meaning we target known hot-spots and where illegal fishing is reported to us. We take illegal fishing very seriously – it’s not fair on other anglers and endangers the future of the sport. “We urge people to help us protect the health of our fisheries by reporting any suspected illegal activity to us. “We’ll be continuing our patrols in the coming weeks, including over the Easter weekend.” All the money from rod licence sales goes back into maintaining the health of fisheries and waters, angling projects and much more. Anyone caught fishing without a valid licence could be fined up to £2,500 and fishing during the close season attracts a fine of up to £50,000. At £27 for coarse fishing and non-migratory trout, or £72 to also fish for salmon and sea trout, the annual licence is great value for money. There are flexible options to choose from too: a 1 or 8 day licence or the full season. There are also junior and concession options. You can buy a rod licence online from the Post Office, at your local Post Office or by phoning 0344 800 5386. And this week you can take a friend fishing – anglers are encouraged to take someone fishing with them for free to give them a taste of the great sport. For more information and dates visit the Take a Friend Fishing website . Environment Agency officers routinely carry out licence checks and anyone with information about illegal fishing activities is urged to report it via the Environment Agency’s Incident Hotline on 0800 80 70 60 or anonymously to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."

/government/news/repairs-to-teignmouth-sea-wall-completed,"Three months after winter storms damaged a section of Teignmouth's promenade, repairs have been completed.     Repairs to Teignmouth sea wall completed  Environment Agency The area around the sea wall has been re-opened to the public. The sea wall, promenade and beach area are popular public spaces as well as providing coastal flood protection to Teignmouth. It was therefore essential to carry out repairs quickly as the instability of the wall and promenade threatened increased flood risk to homes and possible safety risks for the public. The Environment Agency worked with Teignbridge District Council and contractors Team Van Oord to repair the sea wall and secure it for the future. During the work a granite ‘obelisk’ – thought to be a marker stone dating back to 1874 – was discovered on the beach. The stone was recovered and the local authority hopes the obelisk can be reinstated in its rightful place near the lighthouse. Conditions during the repair work were challenging, with continued storms, bad weather, and access for machinery only possible on the low tides around spring tides. Environment Agency staff were only able to work on the beach for a few hours at a time, for a few days at a time, and often had to work during the night. Thom Buxton-Smith, for the Environment Agency, said: Despite these challenges we worked with Team Van Oord to complete the repairs quickly. The voids have been filled beneath the promenade, slipway and car park. We have repaired the limestone masonry sea wall and installed steel sheet piling at the base of the wall to stabilise it, The promenade was re-opened to the public in time for the Easter weekend and the remaining fencing and site equipment will be removed by the end of this week."
/government/news/st-thomas-emergency-flood-plan-to-be-put-to-the-test,"Two exercises will test the emergency flood plan for the St Thomas area of Exeter.      St Thomas Emergency Flood Plan to be put to the test  Environment Agency Dates and details have been set to test the emergency flood plan in place for St Thomas in Exeter. The first test, a tabletop exercise, will take place at Danes Castle Fire Station on 12 April, between 7pm and 9.30pm. It will be hosted by Devon Fire and Rescue Service and will include members of the St Thomas Community Emergency Group working alongside the Environment Agency and blue light services. The purpose of the exercise is to test the plan in response to a flood event in St Thomas based on a real-time scenario. In May, the second exercise will see the community group, blue light services, the Environment Agency and RNLI inshore rescue team to play out and test the flood scenario in ‘real life’ by deploying equipment and personnel to where they will be needed in the event of a flood. Mike Walling, the St Thomas Community Emergency Group chairman, said: It’s vital that we test our plans to check that they are viable. It’s also important that emergency service personnel and community volunteers are well briefed and tested in a real life situation. Dave Hubbard, from the St Thomas Community Emergency Group, said: We are delighted to put our plans to the test with the help of the Environment Agency and rescue services. The learning from both exercises will feed into preparation for a real event. The group recently called for new members to come forward and join. To join the group, email dc.flood@environment-agency.gov.uk quoting St Thomas Community Emergency Group, or call and ask for Devon and Cornwall Flood Resilience Team on 03708 506 506. Follow us on Twitter @EnvagencySW . Note to Editors: Exeter St Thomas is one of 52 communities in the South West at a very high risk of flash flooding. How can I prepare for flooding? View the Environment Agency’s flood map to check if your home or businesses is at risk of flooding. Learn how to protect your home, family and possessions, using the 3 steps to safety: be aware - you are likely to have little or no warning - never risk your life and do not walk or drive through flood water get to safety - understand where to go if you get caught in a flash flood Step 1 - be aware People generally underestimate the risk to their safety. Flash flooding happens very suddenly: it may flood before emergency services arrive rivers may flood to heights above defences watch for signs that a river or stream is about to flood. It may be fast flowing. Its water may be discoloured and contain debris listen for weather warnings on the radio and TV Step 2 - never risk your life Most injuries and deaths caused during a flash flood happen when people try to cross a watercourse on foot or in a vehicle. Never underestimate the danger of water: it only takes 15cm (6 inches) of fast flowing water to knock over an adult there may be hidden dangers in the water including rubble, vegetation and exposed drains it only takes 60cm (2 feet) of water to lift and sweep away a 4x4 car or small lorry Step 3 - get to safety Attempting to leave the area may not necessarily be the best thing to do in a flash flood. If you know where to move to in a flash flood you are more likely to stay safe. if possible move to a higher storey stay where you are and wait for instructions from the emergency services if you are considering evacuation, think about how close you are to the flooding and if you can move without walking or driving through flood water identify safe routes away from the likely location of flash flooding If you are in a vulnerable place or get caught outside: seek shelter in the nearest two-storey (or higher) building or go to higher ground call 999 if you are trapped Acting now and planning what you would do in the event of a flood could minimise the potential damage and distress that flooding causes."
/government/news/restaurants-and-fish-mongers-warned-over-illegal-salmon-and-sea-trout-sales,"Enforcement officers carrying out inspections in Yorkshire Restaurants and fish mongers warned over illegal salmon and sea trout sales  Environment Agency The Environment Agency is clamping down on illegal sales of wild salmon and sea trout by targeting restaurants, hotels, pubs and fish mongers in Yorkshire. Fisheries enforcement officers are visiting food businesses to check coolers, freezers and fish storage facilities as well as giving advice on how to spot wild salmon and sea trout that have been caught illegally. Bailiffs are also patrolling rivers and coastal areas, overtly and covertly, to target illegal fishing. Anyone caught illegally fishing or in possession of illegally-caught fish will face prosecution and a substantial fine. The enforcement campaign aims to protect wild salmonid populations that are put at risk by illegal fishing. The operation covers the Yorkshire coast with a particular focus on the Esk catchment area in North Yorkshire. Paul Slater, team leader at the Environment Agency, said: We are determined to stop the illegal fishing and trade of salmon and sea trout because these activities have a terrible impact on fish populations. Legitimate netsmen sell wild salmon and sea trout with an Environment Agency tag attached to the carcass. If this is not present, then you may be handling illegally-caught fish and you may be liable for prosecution. Other tell-tale signs are apparent on the fish carcasses themselves: any spear of gaff wounds, or snare or gill net marks on a salmonid can indicate that a fish has been caught illegally. Wild salmon and sea trout that have been caught legitimately must possess an Environment Agency tag that identifies the source of the fish. This tag must remain attached until a fish is processed. Salmon or sea trout caught by rod and line will not be tagged, because it is illegal to handle, buy or sell salmonids caught this way. It is also illegal to handle these fish if you suspect they may have been taken during the close season. Salmonids cannot be sold or bought if they are ‘unclean’ - a term used to describe a fish that is about to spawn or has recently spawned. Unclean fish can be dark in colour with red spots on their gill covers. If you are handling farmed or imported net-caught fish, which do not require tags, you are advised to ask the seller for a signed receipt that shows the seller’s name and address and details of when and where the fish were caught. If you are offered wild salmon or sea trout that you suspect has been rod caught, illegally caught or are unclean, please report the matter to the Environment Agency’s incident hotline on 0800 807060. Anyone who spots illegal fishing should also report the information to the hotline.

Fishing without rod licence costs anglers nearly £1,000  Environment Agency Two licence-dodging anglers have been fined a total of nearly £1,000 for illegally fishing at a Somerset lake. The case was brought by the Environment Agency Callum Cornish and Bradley Wiltshire were caught during routine rod licence checks at Newton Park Lake in Bath on 6 September, 2015. They were both ordered to pay £457 in fines and costs by Bath magistrates on Monday, 11 April, 2016, after being found guilty of fishing without a valid licence. Cornish, 68, of Shaws Way, Bath and Wiltshire, 20, of Cameley Green, Bath did not appear in court and were sentenced in their absence after being convicted of an offence under Section 27(1) (a) of the Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries Act 1975. Sarah Chare, Head of Fisheries at the Environment Agency, said: All money raised through rod licence sales is used to protect and improve fish stocks and fisheries benefiting anglers. A rod licence is a legal requirement for fishing. It costs £27 for a licence for coarse fishing and non-migratory trout or £72 if you also fish for salmon and sea trout. Anglers can buy a licence for the full season, a 1 day licence or an 8 day licence. You can purchase a licence online from the Post Office or at your local Post Office. Alternatively, phone 0344 800 5386. Buying a rod licence online from the Post Office website is easier as it saves both time and administration costs, meaning that more money can be spent on improving fish stocks and fishing. Anyone fishing illegally is cheating other licence paying anglers and can expect to be prosecuted if they are caught. In 2014/15 the Environment Agency checked 70,000 rod licences and prosecuted more than 2,000 anglers for fishing without a licence resulting in more than £500,000 in fines and costs."

/government/news/two-surrey-boaters-fined-for-avoiding-registration-fees-on-river-thames,"The owners of 2 boats found navigating the River Thames without valid registrations have been convicted by Redhill Magistrates this week.  Two Surrey boaters fined for avoiding registration fees on River Thames  Environment Agency Christopher Ackerman of Wellington Court, Kingston-Upon-Thames was ordered in his absence to pay a total of £1181.15 for failing to display a valid registration plate. Ackerman was fined £440, ordered to pay compensation to the Environment Agency in respect of the unpaid registration fee of £612.15, prosecution costs of £85 and a victim surcharge of £44. Khameel Malbocus of The Retreat, Surbiton, Surrey, pleaded guilty by post for failing to display a valid registration plate on her boat and ordered to pay a total of £673. Malbocus was fined £220, with £371 in compensation to the Environment Agency, prosecution costs of £60 and a victim surcharge of £22. Ackerman’s vessel Longwood Lady was spotted by an Environment Agency Waterways Officer without a valid registration on 17 September 2015 at Teddington Towpath, Ham Common. The vessel was booked for being unregistered and the defendant was made aware in writing that he needed to comply to avoid prosecution, however he failed to do so. Malbocus was also observed not displaying a valid registration during the same routine inspection along the Teddington Towpath. Again, her vessel Sirius was booked for being unregistered and Malbocus warned in writing that as owner, she faced prosecution if she failed to register her boat. Despite being given numerous opportunities by the Environment Agency, the defendant failed to do so. Malbocus told the court by email that she was currently working part time but was not working at the time of the incident so could not afford the fees and she was trying to get her boat fixed. The Inland Waterways Order 2010 requires all vessels ‘kept’ or ‘used’ on the River Thames, to be registered with the Environment Agency and display a valid annual boat registration plate (similar to a vehicle tax disc). The Environment Agency carries out checks along all 135 miles of the navigable non-tidal River Thames to ensure that all boats kept or used on it have a valid registration plate. It takes enforcement action against all those that don’t. It also takes enforcement action against a wide range of other offences relating to boating, often working as part of a multi-agency approach with the police and local councils. A series of multi-agency action days in Surrey and other areas along the lower Thames has seen a number of illegally moored boats moving on, illegal mooring poles being removed, and a significant reduction in the amount of littering and other anti-social behaviour taking place. Nick McKie-Smith, Environment Agency Waterways Enforcement Manager said: The income we raise from boat registration is imperative for the upkeep of the non-tidal River Thames. It is used to improve and maintain the navigation and lock structures as well as providing facilities such as sewage disposal, water points and electricity charging points. By not complying, we lose vital revenue, which damages the future of these great waterways. Owners of boats not displaying valid registration plates could face prosecution, so it is important that they are aware of and adhere to this requirement. Ignorance is not an excuse."
/government/news/national-crack-down-on-rogue-traders-and-waste-criminals,"Rogue traders across the UK were targeted in a national day of action on Wednesday 13 April 2016 as part of a  crime prevention initiative.  National crack down on rogue traders and waste criminals  Environment Agency Activities on the day ranged from executing warrants, identifying vehicles used by criminals through automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) to conducting intelligence-led patrols in areas where older or vulnerable people live. Police and trading standards services coordinated efforts across the country with support from the Department of Work and Pensions, Environment Agency, HM Revenue and Customs, the DVLA, the DVSA, Border Force and Scambusters to catch rogue traders and to prevent innocent people from becoming victims of crime. Over 30 Environment Agency Officers were out on the ground working closely with emergency responders and investigators. Environment Agency teams were involved at locations right across England. Staff physically assisted in over 200 road side checks of vehicles and site visits. In 2015 Operation Rogue Trader saw over 100 people arrested, £3.1m worth of property recovered and over 5,000 vehicles inspected. Andrew Luckett, the Office Manager for Operation Liberal, said: “Distraction crimes and scams continue to occur and the victims are swindled out of their life savings for unnecessary and overpriced work which has a detrimental effect on the victim’s health and their confidence. “We will continue to carry out operations like this and remind the public to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity or concerns about an individual offering to carry out work to the relevant agency.” Operation Rogue Trader is led by Operation Liberal, the national intelligence unit that links associated crimes and gathers intelligence on key nominals and organised crime groups who travel extensively throughout the UK. Nicky Lawton, Deputy Director of the Environment Agency’s Enforcement Service said: “The Environment Agency works closely with partner enforcement organisations to identify and stop rogue traders. We will take action against illegal operators who risk polluting the environment and undercutting legitimate businesses. “Any waste collector should have Environment Agency permits, always check whether a trader is legitimate and if you are suspicious of a waste collector report it to the incident hotline 0800 80 70 60 or Crimestoppers.” Steve Playle, the Chartered Trading Standards Institute lead officer for doorstep crime said: “Operation Rogue Trader is a great opportunity for the different partners involved in tackling doorstep crime to come together and carry out some enforcement work and to raise awareness of the issues. Cold calling criminals undertaking property maintenance work continue to exploit vulnerable and elderly home owners.” “Trading Standards officers right across the UK are committed to making criminal’s lives as difficult as possible by sharing intelligence, causing disruption and taking criminal prosecutions where necessary.” Anyone with information that could lead to the arrest of any doorstep offender or rogue trader should ring their local police or call Crimestoppers, the national charity, anonymously on 0800 555 111. People should report cases of rogue traders or uninvited doorstep callers to Citizens Advice Consumer Service on 03454 04 05 06. The Environment Agency hotline is: 0800 80 70 60 ENDS Background to Operation Rogue Trader Operation Rogue Trader is a joint operation being run by Operation Liberal, the national intelligence unit whose remit includes burglary and fraud, and Trading Standards. Rogue traders are criminals who take advantage of householders by using high pressure sales techniques. The work is often sub-standard or not required at all. A distraction burglar is defined as someone who gains access to your property by distracting or tricking their way in to steal cash or valuables. Operation Liberal All forces in England, Wales and Scotland are members of Operation Liberal. Operation Liberal supports national investigations into doorstep crime and other acquisitive serious organised criminality. The unit identifies and analyse crime series and monitors intelligence on criminals and organised crime groups who travel throughout the UK to commit these crime types. This collaborative approach solves more crimes and sends a message to the criminals who commit this type of crime that they will face a nationally co-ordinated investigation and as a result they can expect significant sentences."

/government/news/keswick-flood-defence-repairs-begin,"Work to repair the seals on the glass panels along High Hill in Keswick, Cumbria, after they were damaged during the December 2015 floods. Keswick flood defence repairs begin  Environment Agency On Tuesday 3 May the Environment Agency started work to repair the seals on the glass panels along High Hill in Keswick after they were damaged during the December 2015 floods. The panels are designed to be strong enough to withstand the pressure of flood water as well as the impact force of large floating debris such as trees. These latest repairs follow the work already undertaken by the Environment Agency to remove gravel washed down the River during the floods. Floods Minister Rory Stewart said: “Across Cumbria, the Environment Agency is working hard to repair flood defences and protect homes and businesses. This work in Keswick is part of an extensive £10million programme in Cumbria that has already seen more than 3,000 flood defences inspected, with around 100 repair projects set to be completed by the autumn. We are also investing over £43million to better protect more than 3,500 homes across the county over the next five years. The Cumbria Floods Partnership is now bringing together local authorities, the Environment Agency, land owners and community groups to look at the county’s river catchments as a whole and consider how we can better protect the county from flooding in the future.” Kath Tanner, Flood Recovery Manager for the Environment Agency said: “The repairs to the glass panels in Keswick form an essential part of our wider £10million programme of work to repair flood defences damaged in the December floods. We plan to complete all of the necessary repairs by autumn 2016.” The glass panels in Keswick are 2.5m wide and 0.8m high and made up of 4 sheets of glass, 2 inner sheets and 2 outer sheets with an overall thickness 42mm. The panels will be removed, refurbished and replaced in batches of 6. Temporary metal sheets will be fitted while the glass panes are out. A separate piece of work is ongoing to investigate the cause and extent of flooding in Keswick and identify ways of reducing local flood risk in the future. Cumbria County Council is in the process of collating the findings in a ‘Section 19 Flood Investigation Report’, the first draft of which will be shared with the local community at a meeting at Greta Gardens on 17 May from 6pm to 9pm. Local residents and businesses are urged to attend to provide information and have their say on the future of local flood risk management.

River Roding Flood Risk Management Strategy  Environment Agency Updated July 2015 In 2012, the Environment Agency adopted a strategy for managing flood risk in the River Roding catchment. The strategy looks ahead for the next 100 years and makes recommendations to manage flood risk in the catchment. Currently there are around 1500 properties at risk of flooding in the Roding Catchment, many located in the middle and lower parts of the catchment, in Woodford, South Redbridge, Ilford and Loughton. Through this strategy the Environment Agency has identified ways to alleviate flood risk to nearly 900 properties. They have included climate change predictions in our assessment of our proposals, meaning these properties should remain protected even with a 20% increase in river levels as a result of climate change. The strategy recommendations include: Proposed changes to the Environment Agency’s current maintenance regime, to prioritise areas where flood risk is greatest and to cease maintenance where the effect is minimal Recommend structural works in Woodford to reduce risk of flooding from the River Roding and surface water Identifying a location in the upper catchment where a flood storage area could be constructed to reduce flood risk to properties throughout the catchment Read the Environment Agency’s Update to the River Roding Flood Risk Management Strategy 2012 for a detailed summary of the strategy and updates on the work completed since it was published. Carrying out the recommendations made in the strategy Reducing flood risk in Woodford Since July 2013 the Environment Agency and London Borough of Redbridge have been working together to investigate recommendations made in the River Roding Flood Risk Management Strategy for a flood alleviation scheme in Woodford.

/government/news/river-diverted-to-reduce-flood-risk,"The River Ouseburn has been diverted as part of a major scheme to tackle flooding in Brunton Park, Newcastle. River diverted to reduce flood risk  Environment Agency Northumbrian Water and the Environment Agency began the £7 million joint flood reduction scheme in October 2014. The Brunton Park scheme will reduce the risk of flooding to more than 100 properties in Mitford Gardens, Princes Close, Fairway Close, Princes Road, Waterbury Road and Clayworth Road. Diverting the flow Work has involved installing 380 metres of new river channel to divert the flow of the Ouseburn from the estate, constructing 650 metres of flood defences (walls and earth embankment) using the current section of Ouseburn river channel and a new storage basin to drain and store more than seven million litres of surface water. It’s also included installing two kilometres of new sewer pipe and a new storage tank, which will hold up to 450,000 litres of water. The newly created river channel and storage basin, known as SuDS (sustainable urban drainage system), will also create additional water dependent habitat for wildlife, and a Kingfisher nest and perch will be installed. Partnership scheme Paul Davison, Northumbrian Water’s project manager, said: “We know that being flooded is a truly awful experience for our customers and reducing the risk of flooding to homes and businesses is our top priority. “It is the first time that Northumbrian Water has worked on a scheme which has involved creating a section of new river channel so that the current channel can be used for storage. This is an innovative and creative solution which will enable us to manage surface water in the natural environment. “Our partnership approach, which has also involved working closely with Newcastle City Council, has been vital to ensure a holistic, sustainable and efficient approach to tackle flooding in this area. We would like to thank residents in the area and the City of Newcastle Golf Club for their continued patience and cooperation.” Environment Agency Flood Risk Manager for the North East, Phil Welton, added: “Diverting the river channel further west into the golf course is a major part of this vital scheme to protect homes in Brunton Park, and turning the flow from the old channel to new marks a key moment. “This project is a great example of how working in partnership brings integrated and sustainable solutions to life, achieving better outcomes for local residents and ensuring projects are delivered with better value for money.” New play park Remaining work, which will be completed in July, will involve completing the construction of the flood defence embankment and walls; diversion and construction of surface water outfalls which will discharge surface water from the sewer network into the SuDS basin; creation of the storage basin alongside the existing river channel and reinstatement and landscaping work. The play park on Lincoln Green had to be removed while this work was carried out. A new play park has been designed, in partnership with Newcastle City Council and the local community, and will be opened in July. Mick Murphy Director of Communities at Newcastle City Council, said: “The City Council has been pleased to contribute towards the cost of this project, and we are grateful for the significant investment made by both the Environment Agency and Northumbrian Water to reduce the flood risk for residents of Brunton Park.”"

James Roche, Angling Trust Senior Regional Officer, said: “Get back into angling is a fantastic opportunity for anyone who might have stopped fishing to come back to the sport. We know that sometimes life-events take over and make finding the time for angling tricky. “The licensed coaches running these sessions will provide info about the latest tackle and where to go next – a real confidence booster so that participants will be ready to get back into angling immediately.” Lots more opportunities to get back into angling can be found on the Angling Trust’s Facebook events page , as well as on the Angling Trust’s eight new regional Facebook pages .

/government/news/operation-targets-rural-crime,"Environment Agency officers join police to crack down on rural crime in major operation  Operation targets rural crime  Environment Agency The Environment Agency joined forces with police in a major operation to tackle cross border criminals. North East Environment Agency officers supported police from Durham, North Yorkshire and Northumbria forces on patrols to clampdown on criminals in rural areas. Operation Checkpoint – which also involved Cumbria, Cleveland and Lancashire police forces – took place on Tuesday night, May 17. Checkpoint is the largest rural policing operation of its kind in the country, and aims to gather intelligence about travelling criminals, disrupt their use of the road network and bring anyone found breaking the law to justice. Fisheries enforcement patrols Environment Agency officers supported the operation by carrying out fisheries enforcement patrols to gather intelligence and raise crime awareness. During the operation police used Automatic Number Plate Recognition technology to target vehicles suspected of being linked to crime, as well as checking vehicles in suspicious circumstances and focusing on key locations. In total, more than 10 vehicles were seized for offences including no insurance, failing to stop for police and no tax. Partners join forces Environment Agency Enforcement Team Leader for the North East, Dave Edwardson, said: “We work closely with the police every day to target illegal fishing and working together means we can make a co-ordinated effort in gathering information and taking enforcement action. “Illegal fishing damages fish stocks and the environment and is unfair on anglers who abide by the law and buy their rod licences – the income from which is used to fund improvements to fisheries and habitats. “Our role in Operation Checkpoint was to support police in their patrols, specifically encouraging anglers and the wider angling community to report suspicious activity. “This in turn increases the amount of information and intelligence we receive about those fishing illegally or suspected of being involved in other crimes in our rural communities.” Anyone with information about illegal fishing is asked to contact the Environment Agency’s 24-hour Incident Hotline on 0800 807060, or the police on 101.

Ashford waste company employees fined £25,419 for waste crime.  Environment Agency Employees of an Ashford-based waste management business have been fined a total of £25,419 for the illegal deposit and burning of large quantities of waste wood at Marlow Farm near Lenham and Tanglewood near Charing. Richard Monks was fined £5,525 with £9,000 costs. Richard Monks is a Director of Green Box Recycling Kent Limited but pleaded guilty in a personal capacity. Andrew Malyan, employed as a Green Box driver was fined £3,689 with £3,000 costs, whilst Robert Clark, a Farm Manager, was fined £1,205 with £3,000 costs at Folkestone Magistrates Court on 24 May 2016. Following a complaint to Maidstone Borough Council in November 2012, Environment Agency officers inspected Marlow Farm and observed evidence that controlled waste had been burnt. Further investigations identified vehicles with Green Box livery depositing waste wood, with their drivers either setting fire to the waste themselves or allowing others to do so. Richard Monks did not instruct or encourage any of the drivers to carry out the activities, but accepted that he knew that some loads of wood were being taken to Marlow Farm to be burnt. He chose to turn a blind eye to it and knowingly permitted up to 15 loads of waste wood to be deposited and burnt illegally at Marlow Farm. However, someone at Green Box instructed Andrew Malyan to deposit the wood waste illegally and he is now subject to a criminal conviction. Green Box is a licensed waste transfer business located at Ashford Industrial Centre, Cobbs Wood in Ashford. The business accepts wastes, including waste wood, for sorting and treatment prior to being sent for lawful disposal or recycling elsewhere. Alan Cansdale, Environment Manager said, Their actions showed blatant disregard for the environment. Waste crime can undermine legitimate businesses. In cases like this where illegal operations are connected with licensed businesses, we have no hesitation in prosecuting those involved as we want to make sure that waste crime doesn’t pay."

Three Bristol men, proved guilty in their absence, were ordered to pay over 22 times the cost of an annual licence. A fourth man plead guilty and was ordered to pay nearly 17 times the cost of a full licence. The cases were brought by the Environment Agency. Thomas Chitson, 26, of Hanham Road, Bristol, and Ollie Hussey, 18, of Cock Road, Bristol, were caught fishing at Acorn Fishery in Clevedon without rod licences on 8 October, 2015. With costs, each was ordered to pay £611. Wesley White, 31, and James Thomas, 28, both of Bath Road, Thornbury, were caught fishing without rod licences at Plantation Lakes, Kingston Seymour, on 8 October, 2015. With costs, White was ordered to pay £611 and Thomas, who plead guilty, was ordered to pay £451 in total. Chitson, Hussey and White were proved guilty in absence. Following the verdict, an Environment Agency spokesman said: “Money raised from rod licence sales is used to protect and improve fish stocks and fisheries, benefiting all anglers. We hope that this case will provide yet another deterrent for any angler thinking of fishing illegally.” As well as cheating other anglers, fishing illegally can carry a hefty penalty. Getting caught without an appropriate licence could land you with a criminal conviction, a fine of up to £2,500 and up to £50,000 for byelaw offences. Last year, in England the Environment Agency checked over 62,000 rod licences and prosecuted more than 1900 anglers for rod and line offences resulting in fines and costs in excess of £500,000.

/government/news/somerset-builder-prosecuted-for-dumping-and-burning-waste-near-crewkerne,"Environment Agency secures its first order banning someone from handling waste Somerset builder prosecuted for dumping and burning waste near Crewkerne.  Environment Agency A 53-year-old Somerset builder who dumped and burned illegal waste in a field has been given a five-year Criminal Behaviour Order and 150 hours community service. Bernard Molloy, aged 53, of Shepton Beauchamp, admitted at Taunton Crown Court to transporting, depositing and transferring waste to Walditch Lane, Merriot, Somerset. The case was brought by the Environment Agency. The terms of the Criminal Behaviour Order stipulate Molloy, a self-employed builder, must not collect, carry, transport or deposit any waste in the course of his or any other business. It also states that he must not use any vehicle to collect, carry, transport or deposit waste as a business. The last term of the order states that he must not enter on foot or in a vehicle Wall Ditch Lane, Merriott, Somerset or the field where waste was dumped. Bernard Molloy has also been ordered to carry out 150 hours community service and to pay £2,500 towards the investigation costs. Bernard Molloy was questioned by police after his flat-bed Ford Transit was seen travelling to and from a field off Wall Ditch Lane, Merriott. Several people saw him driving down the lane fully- laden with builders rubble, kitchen units, fridges and freezers. His journeys to the site were usually early in the morning. Molloy was filmed arriving at the field with waste and leaving unladen, He was also filmed burning waste. A local dog walker said he saw the flat-bed Transit on at least 20 occasions. It usually returned back up the lane empty around 30 minutes later. He did not see any other vehicle carrying waste down Wall Ditch Lane. On August 19, 2014 Agency officers visited the site and saw it was covered in piles of domestic and business waste. The site did not have a waste permit. Documents were found in black bin bags with names and addresses on. A number of people whose names were on the documents were contacted and asked how their waste ended up in the field that is accessed via a padlocked gate. When questioned, Molloy said he was in the ‘waste clearing business’ and admitted tipping rubble and hardcore in the field to make a track. He also admitted he didn’t have a waste carriers licence. However, he denied tipping any other waste at the site and claimed he’d had to change the lock on the field gate several times, implying other people had entered and tipped waste at the site. Appearing before Taunton Crown Court, Bernard Molloy pleaded guilty to depositing controlled waste including rubble, timber, electrical items and various mixed and commercial waste in a field located off Wall Ditch Lane, Merriott, without an environmental permit, between June 1 and December 18, 2014. Contrary to Regulations 12(1) and 38(1)(a) of the Environmental Permitting Regulations 2010. Molloy was also convicted of illegally burning waste in a manner likely to cause pollution or harm to human health and transporting controlled waste without a waste carriers licence, both offences under the Environmental Protection Act 1990. The Criminal Behaviour Order is believed to be the first such order obtained by the Environment Agency. Essentially, it prevents, by court order, a person engaging in any professional activities involving the collection, transport and deposit of waste. If the order is breached Mr Molloy will risk a prison sentence of up to five years."

Environment Agency enforcement targets close season offenders  Environment Agency Environment Agency enforcement teams have been busy cracking down on illegal fishing during the first few weeks of the coarse fish close season. Officers carried out more than 380 targeted patrols and found more than 70 people fishing on waters that are off-limits. The close season is in place to help natural fish populations spawn so it is illegal to fish during this time on rivers and some protected still waters. For example, you can’t fish for coarse fish on any river in England and Wales from 15 March to 15 June. An additional 55 other offences were detected during these patrols, with reports issued for unlicensed fishing and illegal traps seized. Illegal fishing potentially carries a criminal conviction and a fine of up to £50,000. Sarah Chare, Head of Fisheries at the Environment Agency, said: We are passionate about making fisheries and angling the best it can be in England. Patrols will continue throughout the close season, and beyond, to combat all types of illegal fishing. The vast majority of anglers who fish legally deserve to see those who flout the law brought to account. To that criminal minority our message is clear; we won’t hesitate to take action to stop illegal fishing. This work is just one part of the Environment Agency’s work to tackle illegal fishing. In partnership with the Angling Trust, Operation Clampdown, is running nationally with 240 volunteers trained to keep watch on their local waters and report incidents. The multi-agency initiative focusing on illegal fishing during the close season is now a national operation for the first time. More police forces are joining the partnership against illegal fishing, with Operation Leviathan covering most of western England, and Operation Traverse focusing on the east. The Environment Agency also works in partnership with the police under the overarching National Wildlife Crime Unit initiative, called Project Poacher . There are lots of still waters and canals open for those that want to wet a line. The Environment Agency is reminding anglers aged 12 and over that a licence is required on all waters. A full rod licence costs from just £27 (concessions available). You can buy your rod licence online from the Post Office , at your local Post Office or by phoning 0344 800 5386.

'Fake name' fisherman tracked down by bailiff for fishing in Somerton without rod licence  Environment Agency Angler Darryl Bushen didn’t hang around after he was caught fishing at a Somerset lake without a rod licence. The flighty fisherman was approached by an Environment Agency bailiff at the Viaduct Fishery, Somerton. When asked to produce his rod licence, Bushen said ‘It’s at home’, so the officer asked for his name and address. The angler said his name was ‘Barry Brown.’ The bailiff moved a short distance away to get a better phone signal to check Bushen’s details. It was at this point the angler made his exit. When the officer returned to the lakeside, the defendant had gone leaving two fishing rods on the bank and lines in the water. A friend fishing nearby said Bushen had gone to the site shop, but when the bailiff checked, there was no sign of the angler. The friend later rang Bushen and told him the bailiff would seize his fishing equipment if he didn’t return. Bushen refused and his fishing tackle, worth several hundred pounds, was seized. Subsequent checks revealed the angler seen fishing was Darryl Bushen, of Selworthy Road, Weston-super-Mare. Bushen was fined a total of £300 by Yeovil magistrates and ordered to pay £127 costs after pleading guilty to three offences including fishing at Viaduct Fishery, Somerton, without a valid rod licence, failing to state his name to a water bailiff and leaving a rod and line with baited hook in the water unattended. He was also ordered to pay a £20 victim surcharge. The offences were committed on October 4, 2015. The case was heard on June 9, 2016. It is easy to buy a rod licence. You can purchase online , in person or by phone from the Post Office. Tel 0344 800 5386, or yearly direct debit with the Environment Agency. Tel 03708 506 506 or email enquiries@environment-agency.gov.uk . It costs £27 for a non-migratory trout and coarse fish licence or £72 for a salmon and sea trout licence.

The Environment Agency has made an additional £200,000 available after strong rod licence sales in 2014/15. This will support the National Angling Strategy by funding 40 to 50 projects in England. The money includes £150,000 to support projects themed “Access for All” aimed at increasing participation for people with disabilities by tackling poor access to and at fisheries. A further £50,000 will combat fish predation by funding fish refuges, non-lethal control of cormorants and goosanders, otter-proof fencing and other projects to manage unsustainable predation of fish stocks. Sarah Chare, Head of Fisheries at the Environment Agency, said: In 2015, we sold 1.2 million rod licences. This is great for angling because it means more investment in fisheries and the fishing clubs supporting anglers up and down the country. This round of the Angling Improvement Fund represents the best of our partnership with the Angling Trust as it is aimed at getting more people into our sport and protecting fish from predators. Mark Lloyd, Chief Executive of the Angling Trust, said: One of the many brilliant things about angling is that some disciplines can be practised by people with disabilities and anyone aged 5 to 95, but we need to ensure that they are able to get to the water safely. That’s why this round of funding will be targeted at projects that help improve access to the water, based on research into what their members and customers need. We will also be continuing our work to protect fisheries from predators to support our predation action plan."
/government/news/reading-boaters-caught-without-a-valid-boat-licence,"Two boaters have recently been fined over £1,800 for breaking the laws of the river by Reading Magistrates Court. Reading boaters caught without a valid boat licence  Environment Agency Rowan Newey who lives on his boat, ‘Patience’, was caught without a valid licence for both his houseboat and another vessel called ‘Meet on the Ledge’, which he owns and keeps moored downstream of Horseshoe Bridge, Reading. Mr. Newey pleaded guilty and had to pay compensation costs of £519.40 and £830.56 for each vessel for failing to display a valid registration plate. Jeff Hunt of Vachel Road, Reading, Berkshire, failed to licence his boat ‘Odbarnicle’ and was discovered by Environment Agency enforcement officers at Thames Water Moorings, upstream of Caversham Bridge, Reading. The case against Mr. Hunt was proved in absence at Reading Magistrates Court and fined £220, ordered to pay compensation to the Environment Agency in respect of the unpaid registration fee of £166.95 and prosecution costs of £85. The Inland Waterways Order 2010 requires all vessels ‘kept’ or ‘used’ on the River Thames, to be registered with the Environment Agency and display a valid annual boat registration plate (similar to a vehicle tax disc). The Environment Agency carries out checks along all 135 miles of the navigable non-tidal River Thames to ensure that all boats kept or used on it have a valid registration plate. It takes enforcement action against all those which don’t. It also takes enforcement action against a wide range of other offences relating to boating, often working as part of a multi-agency approach with the police and local councils. A series of multi-agency action days in Surrey and other areas along the lower Thames has seen a number of illegally moored boats moving on, illegal mooring poles being removed, and a significant reduction in the amount of littering and other anti-social behaviour taking place. Nick McKie-Smith, Environment Agency Waterways Enforcement Manager said: The income we raise from boat registration is imperative for the upkeep of the non-tidal River Thames. It is used to improve and maintain the navigation and lock structures as well as providing facilities such as sewage disposal, water points and electricity charging points. By not complying, we lose vital revenue, which damages the future of these great waterways.

Cheating angler hooks hefty fine for fishing illegally  Environment Agency Roman Rybacki, 45, of Chaucer Road, Wellingborough was fined £150, ordered to pay £320 costs and a £20 victim surcharge by magistrates last week (29 June). The court heard that Rybacki was found to be fishing at Stanwick Lake Fisheries, Stanwick, without a rod licence on 4 October, 2015. The case heard at Northampton Magistrates’ Court was brought by the Environment Agency. Peter Stark, Senior Enforcement Officer for the Environment Agency, said: “Anglers who fish without a valid rod licence need to be aware our water bailiffs are out checking. If they are caught we won’t hesitate to prosecute.” Every year across the country, thousands of anglers are prosecuted for not having a fishing licence. The maximum fine for those caught without a licence is £2,500. Any angler aged 12 or over, fishing on a river, canal or still water needs a licence. An annual licence costs from just £27 (concessions available). You can buy your rod licence online from the Post Office , at your local Post Office or by phoning 0344 800 5386. All income from rod licence sales is used to fund our work to protect and improve fish stocks and fisheries. This includes improving habitats for fish and facilities for anglers, tackling illegal fishing and working with partners to encourage people to give fishing a go. Anyone with information about illegal fishing activities can contact the Environment Agency incident hotline on 0800 80 70 60 or anonymously to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."
/government/news/flood-committee-sets-out-24million-spending,"Regional Flood and Coastal Committee sets out commitment to protect homes and businesses in the North East  Flood committee sets out £24million spending  Environment Agency A flood and coastal group will oversee spending of more than £24million to protect hundreds of homes across the North East as it sets out its objectives for the next year. The Northumbria Regional Flood and Coastal Committee (NRFCC) has launched its business plan for 2016/17, which will include work at Blyth, Killingworth, Hartlepool Headland Walls and Greatham South. It also announced in its 2015/16 annual report that it’s overseen 125 projects costing £27million over the past year. When all the work is complete it will have reduced the risk to 1,458 properties, while also making improvements to the environment. Upcoming projects Projects include the completion of the Port Clarence scheme at Wilton Engineering’s site in Teesside, the Morpeth flood alleviation scheme’s upstream dam and storage area – which operated for the first time in January - the Fellgate Estate scheme in South Tyneside, as well as the coastal scheme at Skinningrove. The annual report and business plan together summarise the past year and look forward to the year ahead. It is the second year of a six-year programme of works which was agreed in January 2015. The business plan will be updated each year to take into account any adjustments to the £108million, six-year programme. Most projects in the plan are delivered by the Environment Agency and local authorities, with some carried out by, or in partnership with Northumbrian Water. ‘Great example of partnership working’ NRFCC Chairman Jon Hargeaves said: “On completion of the £27million programme of works from 2015/16, we will see a reduction in flood and coastal erosion risk to 1,458 houses in the region, as well as delivering seven environmental projects. “The committee is a great example of partnership working, with all local authorities, the Environment Agency and Northumbrian Water pulling together on behalf of residents and businesses in the North East. “It’s been a challenging year involving major flooding this past winter which affected hundreds of properties across the region. The committee is keen to understand the impact of this flooding and the issues relating to it. “At future meetings it will be discussed in further detail so we can make decisions moving forward into the years ahead.” Recovery projects underway Currently, a £3million package of recovery projects to repair flood defences damaged in the winter flooding is taking place across the region, with a particular focus on the Tyne Valley in Northumberland. Leila Huntington, Flood and Coastal Risk Manager with the Environment Agency in the North East, added: “We’re working hard to carry out permanent repairs to our damaged flood defences across the region. “We’re also continuing to investigate where new or improved defences can be incorporated into our works programme and will be discussing this process in detail with the committee. “The committee has an essential role in developing and delivering the flood and coastal risk management programmes. The work that has been carried out over the past year has brought significant benefits to communities, property, business and the environment.” Fellgate success The £800,000 Environment Agency funded scheme on the Fellgate Estate in Jarrow, carried out by South Tyneside Council and Northumbrian Water, is one of the first in the country to see a local authority, water and sewerage company working together to tackle flood-affected properties. South Tyneside Council’s Lead Member for Area Management and Community Safety, Councillor Moira Smith, said: “Thanks to a successful partnership, we were able to bring to fruition a scheme which not only reduces flood risk, but also offers wider benefits such as habitat creation, educational opportunities and enhanced health and wellbeing for residents. “By working sustainably and in partnership, the scheme also delivered cost savings of around 36% as well as overwhelming customer satisfaction.” The committee receives funding from a variety of sources, including from Government Grant-in-Aid, public and private contributions and a levy raised through local authorities. The committee consists of elected and independent members and plays an important part in deciding local priorities for the flood and coastal risk management programme in North East England.

/government/news/leeds-businessman-receives-record-jail-sentence-over-22m-recycling-fraud,"Man claimed he had collected and recycled electrical waste to falsely claim fees Leeds businessman receives record jail sentence over £2.2m recycling fraud  Environment Agency A Leeds waste operator has been jailed for seven years and six months for defrauding the electrical waste recycling industry out of £2.2million. Terence Solomon Dugbo, 45, of High Ash Avenue, Leeds, was sentenced on Friday 15 July at Leeds Crown Court following a major Environment Agency investigation and seven-week trial. This is a record sentence for an environmental crime. Investigating officers discovered that Dugbo had falsified paperwork to illegitimately claim that his Leeds-based firm TLC Recycling Ltd had collected and recycled more than 19,500 tonnes of household electrical waste during 2011. In reality, Dugbo’s company had never handled the amounts of waste described, and he was not entitled to the substantial recycling fees he was paid. During the trial, Sailesh Mehta and Howard McCann, prosecuting for the Environment Agency, told the court that the defendant received the money through government-backed Producer Compliance Schemes – organisations that pay for the recycling of old electrical goods to offset the production of new equipment. Seized documents showed that Dugbo’s company was claiming money for waste collections from streets and properties that did not exist. Vehicles used to transfer waste were recorded as being in Northern Ireland, England, and Scotland on the same day. Some vehicles did not exist at all, and some documents showed vast weights of waste being collected by vehicles that could not carry such loads: for example, a moped was said to have carried waste 42 times, and on one trip it was said to have carried 991 TVs and 413 fridges between Dugbo’s businesses. Weights of individual items said to have been collected were also exaggerated: fax machines were logged as weighing 47kg, and drills 80kg. TLC’s paperwork showed that the waste was taken to another firm for supposed treatment – the Leeds Reuse Centre, this being another business run by Dugbo at about the same time as TLC. Dugbo has previous convictions for fraud and illegally exporting banned hazardous waste to Nigeria. He had denied the charges in this latest case – conspiracy to defraud, acting as a company director while disqualified, and breaching an environmental permitting condition – but he was found guilty on all counts. Dugbo had been disqualified from acting as a company director until November 2017 due to the bad debts of a previous company. His involvement in TLC Recycling, which has since gone into liquidation, was in breach of this disqualification. Dugbo also breached environmental laws by treating CFC gas cylinders on the TLC site, even though the permit did not allow the treatment of waste containing ozone-depleting substances. Dr Paul Salter, senior environmental crime officer at the Environment Agency, said after the hearing: Terry Dugbo’s illegal activities defrauded legitimate recycling schemes out of significant amounts of money. He masterminded and fabricated a flow of false paperwork that claimed his business was collecting and recycling vast amounts of waste electrical goods when in fact he wasn’t. This prosecution has been the result of a significant, co-ordinated investigation involving operational, enforcement and legal officers in the Environment Agency, and with help from the Scottish Environment Protection Agency. The length of the sentence handed out by the court today demonstrates the seriousness of Dugbo’s activities. Hopefully this case and the record sentence will act as a warning to others who commit waste crime that they will be pursued and, if convicted, could face serious punishment. In sentencing, Judge Clarke described the fraud as a “sophisticated” crime from a company that was designed to conceal its intentions from everybody involved. He commended the Environment Agency for its conduct of the case, formally thanking Dr Salter for his investigatory work and contribution to the legal proceedings. Judge Clarke said: What I found really amazing was the amount and complexity of the false paperwork. The scale of the investigation here was enormous. It took Dr Salter and his team nearly a year to go through the documents they seized in the search of the premises. Judge Clarke also disqualified Dugbo from acting as a company director for 12 years, stating that he was “a risk to the public”, and he initiated the Environment Agency’s request to begin Proceeds of Crime against Dugbo for £2.2million."

/government/news/dredging-planned-for-a-section-of-the-river-freshney,"Plans to dredge a section of the River Freshney have been announced by the Environment Agency after research revealed new information about the amount of silt in the channel. Dredging planned for a section of the River Freshney  Environment Agency The dredging will help reduce flood risk and will be carried out on the stretch of river between Cromwell Road and New Haven Terrace, including a 200m section between the railway culverts. Previously Environment Agency officers have explained that no silt has built up in the channel in the last 40 years and was therefore was not increasing flood risk, meaning there was no need to dredge. However, after looking back even further into the history of the river, they found that some silt had built up between the time the river was last improved in the 1950s and the introduction of modern maintenance techniques in the 1970s. Adrian Clack, Asset Performance Team Leader said: “We carry out regular reviews to make sure we’re taking the best approach to maintenance, based on all the available evidence. “Dredging where silt has built up will restore the profile of the river and help water flow freely, reducing flood risk. “We’ll also continue our regular maintenance programme and will continue working with our professional partners, who are looking at other ways of improving the river’s condition.” In areas ear-marked for dredging, up to 600mm (2 feet) of silt accumulated before the 1970s. Other parts of the river have seen only about 100mm of silt build-up – approximately the height of a street kerb – and will be cleared by weed-raking. Weed-raking is a part of normal maintenance that was introduced in the 1970s and prevents further silt from building up in the river. Other parts of the river have not seen silt accumulate and therefore do not need additional maintenance above the routine weed-raking the Agency already carries out. Dredging work is expected to start in late autumn and finish in the new year so as not to disturb protected nesting birds and other wildlife."

/government/news/young-anglers-benefit-from-improved-access,"More people have been able to enjoy river fishing for the first time thanks to a joint partnership project to enhance access.   Young anglers benefit from improved access  Environment Agency The Environment Agency, together with the Broads Authority and the Broads Angling Strategy Group (BASG), used rod licence funds to help install 8 angling platforms and 2 disabled accessible pegs at Worlingham on the River Waveney, Norfolk Broads, in 2012. Since then, Mark Casto, an Angling Trust licensed level 2 coach, has taken on several new recruits to this section of river for coaching sessions, and his latest students Darcy Palmer and Jason Neil have been reaping the benefits. Darcy, 14, wanted to learn more about fishing a river but told his coach that he was scared as he could not swim. However following a 2-hour coaching session, he admitted his fear had disappeared as he felt safe and secure on the fishing platform, and now can’t wait to try again. Jason, 21, wanted to learn more about feeder fishing so undertook a coaching session to learn the basics and improve his casting skills. As he is not comfortable in large crowds, he found the experience of fishing at Worlingham “really peaceful and relaxing”. Mark said: “Improving access and giving local people a safe place to go fishing and providing coaching brings real benefits to the community and local people. Fishing is a wonderful healthy activity and it can be enjoyed by all ages young and old. As an angling coach having such a wonderful place to take people fishing at is brilliant and the pegs are solid and safe to coach from which is a real bonus.” Steve Lane, fisheries technical specialist for the EA in the East Anglia area, said: “This showcases the benefits of the rod licence-funded work we do to improve access and angling opportunities for all.” The riverbank at Worlingham was purchased the EA’s predecessor organisation to ensure some of the best fishing in the area was protected and maintained for the benefit of all. Two of the pegs (areas divided up for fishing) close to the car park have an easy access surface and are wheelchair accessible. Funding for the materials was provided by the Broads Authority, with the EA funding the construction work. Improving access for all is among the objectives in the Broads Angling Strategy, a framework set up to sustain and grow angling in the Broads.

/government/news/birmingham-man-caught-out-for-fishing-illegally,"Jen Mun Lin of Sparkhill, Birmingham pleaded guilty to 1 charge of fishing using an illegal method.  Birmingham man caught out for fishing illegally  Environment Agency Mr Lin also pleaded guilty to intentionally obstructing an authorised fisheries enforcement officer during the prosecution at Cheltenham Magistrates’ Court on 15 August 2016. He was made the subject of a 2 year Conditional Discharge, ordered to pay £235 in costs, along with a £15 victim surcharge. On 2 December 2015, Mr Lin was observed on the Gloucester Sharpness Canal, Gloucester by an Environment Agency fisheries enforcement officer pulling set fishing lines from the water. He then put them into a plastic bag he was carrying. The officer approached Mr Lin and asked him to open the carrier bag. Inside the bag the officer saw a number of mono lines, hooks and a pair of scissors. Set lines are an illegal method of fishing. They present significant welfare issues for not only fish, but other wildlife including waterfowl and animals such as otters. These baited hooks on lengths of fishing line are often left unattended for days at a time. If a fish or other animal becomes hooked on these lines, they can suffer for many hours, even days. A discussion then took place whereby Mr Lin was cautioned by the officer and asked to provide his details so that the offence could be reported. Mr Lin initially refused to provide the details, but after the officer enlisted the assistance of a translator to support the discussion he eventually provided his driving licence to prove his identity. Stuart Gamble from the Environment Agency said: The use of set lines is a particularly barbaric poaching method that can cause significant suffering to fish and animals. The vast majority of fish will either die or will be killed by the poacher. This takes away fish stocks that would otherwise be enjoyed by legitimate anglers. We track criminals on an intelligence led basis using information gathered by ourselves, partner organisations and reports from the public. We urge anyone to report illegal fishing as quickly as possible by calling our incident hotline on 0800 80 70 60. Anyone fishing illegally can expect to be prosecuted and face an unlimited and up to £50,000 for byelaw offences. Last year, the Environment Agency checked over 62,000 rod licences and prosecuted more than 1,900 anglers for rod and line offences resulting in fines and costs in excess of £500,000. In mitigation, the court noted that Mr Lin had pleaded guilty at the first opportunity and that there had been communication difficulties between the officer and Mr Lin. The court also said that there had been no violence involved and that the offence of obstructing the officer had been brief."
/government/news/river-blockages-cleared-after-winter-flooding,"Removing shoals from the Aire and Worth to reduce flood risk River blockages cleared after winter flooding  Environment Agency The Environment Agency has this week started an £800,000 programme of work on the rivers Aire and Worth to remove gravel and silt deposited by the winter floods. The deposits, known as shoals, built up in the rivers during the flooding as large volumes of water picked up debris and distributed it along the river system. The shoals increase the likelihood of flooding as they reduce the width of the river channel and create blockages under bridges. Two clearing teams are expected to take around four weeks to clear the debris at 10 sites along the rivers, including sites in Kirkstall, Keighley, Cottingley, Bingley, Silsden, and Earby. In Bingley, where debris has accumulated under two of the five arches of Ireland Bridge, work is due to start on 30 August. Environment Agency contractors will first of all create an access ramp from the Brown Cow car park and then they will work in the water, using heavy equipment to remove the shoals that are currently restricting flow through the arches of Ireland Bridge. They will also clear the entrance to the fish pass which has become silted up, allowing fish to once again bypass the upstream weir. Most of the material will be taken off site, however some of the very large rocks will be reused to help protect the base of the river bank at the Brown Cow. Lee Riley-Thompson, working in asset recovery at the Environment Agency said: Since the winter flooding we have been working hard to inspect and repair damaged defences across the region. Removing these gravel deposits will further reduce flood risk to communities in and around Bradford and Keighley. We have worked closely with our biodiversity team in order to minimise any potential impact the removal of the shoals may have on fish and wildlife in the area. Carrying out the work this month is an ideal time to avoid fish spawning periods and the bird nesting season. On Boxing Day 2015 severe rainfall caused flooding across the Bradford district, with over 800 homes flooded and roads and bridges closed. Since then, Environment Agency teams have carried out thousands of inspections, made crucial repairs and constructed temporary defences."
/government/news/summer-crackdown-on-illegal-fishing,"Environment Agency Fisheries Enforcement Officers deal with 18 people for offences in the North East  Summer crackdown on illegal fishing  Environment Agency The Environment Agency is cracking down on illegal fishing in the North East as the summer season reaches full swing. Over the past four weeks, Fisheries Enforcement Officers have dealt with 18 people for a number of offences. Patrols have been targeted at local rivers and stillwaters based on intelligence gathered and reports from the public, with Derwent Valley, Willington and Durham receiving particular attention. Officers deal with 18 people On the River Derwent, one man was reported for unlicensed fishing and three men from South Tyneside arrested for poaching with a net. In the Durham area, five anglers were reported for fishing without a licence, a further four were unable to produce a licence, one angler was reported for multiple offences of unlicensed fishing, failure to return foul hooked fish and theft, and another reported for theft. At Willington, one angler was reported for unlicensed fishing. Two other anglers who left the area without providing any details were traced and subsequently dealt with for suspected unlicensed fishing, failure to give their details, and obstruction. Vast majority of anglers fish legally Kevin Summerson, Fisheries Enforcement Technical Specialist at the Environment Agency in the North East, said: “The vast majority of anglers fish legally, respecting each other and the sport. The money they pay for a rod licence goes back into supporting fishing, and protects the future of the sport. “Sadly there is a small number of anglers who cheat others by not buying a licence or poaching on our rivers, damaging fish stocks and undermining others. These are the people we continue to target. “We work closely with the police and Angling Clubs to gather intelligence about illegal fishing, and respond to reports from the public, to ensure our patrols are targeted at the right places, and the right people.” It costs from just £27 for a full annual rod licence, with concessions available, and it’s free for under 12s. Fishing without a valid licence could lad you with a fine of up to £2,500 and a criminal record. Money from rod licence sales is invested in fisheries and is used to fund a wide range of projects to improve facilities for anglers, including protecting stocks from illegal fishing, pollution and disease, restoring fish stocks through stocking, and improving habitat. You can buy your rod licence online from the Post Office at your local Post Office branch, or by phoning 0344 800 5386. The Environment Agency urges anyone to report illegal activity by phoning the Environment Agency Incident Hotline on 0800 80 70 60, or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111. Calls can be anonymous."
/government/news/illegal-crayfish-traps-recovered-from-north-east-river,"Environment Agency fisheries officers remove four traps from the River Wear in County Durham.  Illegal crayfish traps recovered from North East river  Environment Agency Environment Agency fisheries officers are investigating after four illegal crayfish traps were recovered from the River Wear. On Wednesday night, Fisheries Enforcement Officers on patrol acted on information about four traps in the river at Shincliffe, County Durham. They seized them and are now carrying out further enquiries. Now experts are reminding people that there is a ban on trapping crayfish in the North East to protect the native population of white clawed crayfish. The invasive American signal crayfish carries a fungal disease which is deadly to the native population. Signal crayfish eat their own young, which means if adults are trapped and removed there aren’t enough to control the population, which can lead to increases in numbers. Unregulated trapping can also lead to people spreading the disease to areas where the white clawed crayfish still populate, and illegal traps can be a danger to other wildlife and protected species. Only a handful of trapping requests are granted in the North East, and that’s for research purposes. Kev Summerson, Fisheries Enforcement Technical Specialist for the North East, said: “There are still populations of our indigenous white clawed crayfish in North East rivers, and this is a protected species which we work hard to safeguard. “Fishing or trapping crayfish in our rivers is illegal and people need to be aware that anyone involved in such activity will potentially face enforcement action.” Anyone who uses our waterways for work, activities or sports is asked to follow Check Clean Dry: Check - check your equipment and clothing for living organisms. Pay particular attention to areas that are damp or hard to inspect. Clean - clean and wash all equipment, footwear and clothes thoroughly. If you do come across any organisms, leave them at the water body where you found them. Dry - Dry all equipment and clothing - some species can live for many days in moist conditions. Make sure you don’t transfer water elsewhere."
/government/news/bank-holiday-blitz-on-illegal-fishing,"Environment Agency Fisheries Enforcement Officers patrol North East waters in rod licence crackdown.  Bank Holiday blitz on illegal fishing  Environment Agency More than 400 North East anglers had their rod licences checked in a Bank Holiday blitz on illegal angling. Environment Agency Fisheries Enforcement officers were out on patrol and acting on intelligence to seek out those fishing without a licence. They made 369 first time checks on anglers right across the North East, and 40 repeat checks of anglers who officers have previously seen on our river banks and stillwaters. Of the 409 checked, seven men were reported for unlicensed fishing; six at stillwaters at Derwent reservoir near Slaley and Fontburn reservoir south of Rothbury, both in Northumberland, Grassholme reservoir near Barnard Castle in County Durham, and Aldin Grange near Durham city. One was reported on the River Tyne near Ovington. Patrols were also carried out on the River Tees, Wear, Tyne and Coquet. Work will continue Kevin Summerson, Fisheries Enforcement Technical Specialist in the North East, said: “It’s good news to see that the vast majority of those enjoying fishing on our great rivers and stillwaters in the North East have a licence. “It’s the small number of anglers who cheat others by not buying a licence who we will continue to target. “The money they pay for a rod licence goes back into supporting fishing and fisheries. Those who flout the law are undermining others and endangering fish stocks and the future of the sport, as well as running the risk of a criminal conviction and fine. “We’ll continue to work closely with angling clubs and police to gather intelligence about illegal fishing, and respond to reports from the public.” The Bank Holiday blitz comes after 18 people were reported for a variety of offences in the North East during a four-week summer season crackdown in July and August. Value for money Anyone fishing illegally can expect to be prosecuted and face a fine of up to £2,500 and up to £50,000 for byelaw offences. Last year, the Environment Agency checked over 62,000 rod licences and prosecuted more than 1,900 anglers for rod and line offences resulting in fines and costs in excess of £500,000. Fishing is great value for money at just £27 for an annual licence, and concessions available. Buying a rod licence is quick and easy - you can buy them online at the Post Office , at your local Post Office branch or by phoning 0344 800 5386. The Environment Agency urges anyone to report illegal fishing by calling 0800 80 70 60."

/guidance/flood-and-coastal-defence-funding-submit-a-project,"How to produce and submit a project proposal for flood and coastal erosion risk management (FCERM) funding. Flood and coastal defence funding: submit a project proposal Flooding and coastal change Environment Agency As a risk management authority , you can apply for a grant in aid ( GiA ) to carry out flood and coastal erosion risk management ( FCERM ) projects. You’ll need to submit a project proposal outlining the works and benefits you want to carry out. Contact your Area Flood and Coastal Risk Manager for help with your application. You don’t need to apply for a grant for emergency coastal protection works. If you want to update a project that’s already been allocated funding you need to contact your Area Flood and Coastal Risk Manager . What you can get a GiA for You can apply for funding for: projects – standalone schemes to build or improve defences and structures strategies – a series of interconnecting projects for complex flood or coastal erosion risk situations studies – investigations of your FCERM options or their environmental effects on designated areas Projects You can get funding to: build new flood and coastal defences (eg channels, walls, embankments) and structures (eg sluices, pumping stations) improve existing defences and structures benefit wildlife, eg improving or protecting habitat You may also be able to get funding for other types of FCERM works, such as: dredging and de-silting – one off projects to bring a channel to a condition where it can then be maintained beach management works – recharge, replenishment and re-nourishment work recycling work – mainly to counteract long shore drift fish or eel passage or screening – works to halt and reverse the decline in European eel stock on FCERM assets Internal drainage boards, local authorities, highways authorities and water companies can only get a GiA for works that: create a new FCRM asset reinstate the design life of an existing FCRM asset extend the design life of an existing FCRM asset Highways authorities and water authorities can only apply for GiA funding for projects to reduce flood risk which wouldn’t ordinarily be within their remit. Beach management and recycling works must be part of a 5-year plan approved by the Environment Agency ( EA ) or the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). Read the latest grant memorandum for a detailed list of what you can get funding for. Strategies You can get funding to produce a strategy if you can show there are credible options to investigate which may reduce complex flood or coastal erosion risks across several interconnected areas. If your strategy is approved, it’ll support your individual project business cases. Strategy applications need to be written up as Strategy Appraisal Reports. Contact your Area Flood and Coastal Risk Manager if you want to produce a strategy. Your strategy application needs to show: the anticipated benefits that will be delivered by the projects it will support any individual projects that have already been identified that are expected to follow the proposed strategy the link between the strategy and these projects If you haven’t identified individual projects yet that would be part of the strategy, you can include an estimate of the likely outcomes of one leading project arising from the strategy. You can get more information in the FCERM appraisal guidance . Studies You can apply for a GiA for a study to investigate whether a FCERM project is needed and the potential options for addressing that need. Your application should be made as part of a project proposal. You need to provide estimates of the project: costs outcomes partnership funding score Contact your Area Flood and Coastal Risk Manager if you want to apply. If your application is unsuccessful, you can contact your regional flood and coastal committee to discuss whether you can fund your study with local levy. What you can’t get a GiA for Projects which cost less than £5,000 can’t get a GiA and must be paid for by maintenance (revenue) funding. The following types of works are considered to be maintenance and aren’t eligible for a GiA : works that reinstate the standard of service of an existing FCERM asset without reinstating its design life beach management such as regrading and re profiling work that’s predominately carried out to counteract ‘drawdown’ dredging and desilting work that’s carried out on a regular basis in order to maintain the condition of a channel How funding works How much GiA funding you can get is based on how much public benefit your project will have, for example how many households are better protected from flooding. If your project qualifies for a GiA which only pays for some of the works, then you’ll need to get the rest of the money through ‘partnership funding’ or reduce your costs. For example, a project qualifying for 90% of GiA funding can still go ahead if you: get a 10% contribution through partnership funding reduce costs by 10% both cut some costs and get some partnership funding so that you have 100% of the funds Partnership funding Anyone who will benefit from a project is a potential partner, such as: local communities businesses developers local authorities You should start trying to find potential funding partners as soon as you’ve identified your need for FCERM works. Contact your Area Flood and Coastal Risk Manager for advice and potential funding partners in your area. As the lead organisation, it’s your responsibility to develop the initial business case and bear the cost of the early stage of project development to the first stage business case. Calculate how much partnership funding you need Use the partnership funding calculator to find out how much: GiA you can get extra funding you’ll need to get through partnerships The calculator takes into account: how many homes will be better protected from flood risk or coastal erosion how many of those homes are in deprived areas (which carry a heavier weighting than homes in non-deprived areas) any benefits to wildlife, eg habitat created or improved Read the partnership funding calculator guidance if you need help using the calculator. When to apply If you want your project to start next year, you must apply before this year’s deadline – contact your Area Flood and Coastal Risk Manager to find out when you must submit your project by. How to apply Projects starting within 6 years You can choose to either: fill in both proposal parts 1 and 2 of the project proposal form – this will automatically populate the FCRM1 medium term plan at the end of the form directly fill in the FCRM1 medium term plan form and get a signed authorisation form from your local FCERM office Send the completed project proposal form or medium term plan form to your Area Flood and Coastal Risk Manager along with: a signed authorisation form from your local FCERM office (only if applying with the medium term plan form) your ‘partnership funding calculator’ showing your funding options a map showing the project’s benefit area If your project is urgent (for example, for statutory, legal or health and safety reasons) you must complete the moderation form in the FCRM1 or project proposal form. You must concisely explain why it is urgent and the impact it will have if the project is not completed in the timescales you have requested. Urgent applications are not more likely to be approved, but you may get your funding more quickly if they are approved. Projects starting in 7 years or more You need to register your project in the FCERM programme to raise awareness that you’ll need a GiA in future. You can choose to either: fill in both proposal parts 1 and 2 of the project proposal form - this will automatically populate the FCRM1 medium term plan at the end of the form directly fill in the FCRM1 medium term plan form Send the form to your Area Flood and Coastal Risk Manager . You’ll need to send in a full application when your project is ready. Your local FCERM area manager will agree a deadline for this with you. How to draw a map of the project’s benefit area You must also submit a map with a ‘polygon’ (a ring or closed shape made up of connected lines) showing the project’s benefit area, eg which households will be protected by the new defence. Polygons must: enclose all households that benefit from the project be individually enclosed with no holes or gaps be defined, measured and recorded to a precision of 10 metres represent an area larger than 10 metres squared be named according to a National Project Number - or the project name if a number hasn’t been issued yet [InlineAttachment:1] show how far upstream and downstream the benefit area extends from the defence Include an attributes table for your shape-file which includes the project name and national project number for each polygon. Use several polygons for a strategy. Discrete urban areas need to be hydraulically connected, ie have linked water systems. You can submit your map as either a: Geographical Information System (GIS) shape-file (prefered) PDF showing an outline on a map This map will be used to update the interactive FCERM activities map . Standalone environmental projects You must try to include any environmental outcomes that you want (eg to protect wildlife sites or create new habitat) into a flood risk management scheme rather than using FCERM funds specifically for this purpose. You can get guidance on what this means from your local FCERM office. You may be able to get funds for standalone environmental projects in certain circumstances, for example: to specifically protect water framework directive protected areas, for example special areas of conservation, special protection areas to ensure that the overall FCERM programme complies with legal obligations If you want to submit a standalone environmental project which isn’t part of a FCERM scheme, contact your local FCERM office . You must fully explain why an integrated scheme is not possible. After you apply If your proposal is successful You’ll get a letter telling you that your application has been successful and telling you what to do next. Defra and EA will also make a public announcement about which projects have got funding. Your project will be added to the programme of FCERM schemes . Depending on the partnership funding status of your project it will be added to either the pipeline or development phase of the programme. You must then develop a business case for the project If your proposal is unsuccessful You can resubmit your application for the following year if you’re unsuccessful.

/government/news/bank-holiday-clampdown-on-illegal-fishing,"Environment Agency fisheries enforcement officers carried out operations to clamp down on illegal fishing near  Scunthorpe and Doncaster Bank holiday clampdown on illegal fishing  Environment Agency This followed information received by anglers and the general public about illegal fishing taking place at a number of locations in the area. In total, 13 offences were detected and the offenders will be reported. Illegal fishing can carry hefty penalties; fishing without a rod licence can lead to a court appearance and fine of up to £2,500 and contravening a local or national Byelaw can land offenders with a fine of up to £50,000. The vast majority of anglers fish legally and abide by the rules, which are designed to protect the environment as well as providing a sustainable and fair future of the sport. Calum Underhill, Fisheries Enforcement Officer at the Environment Agency, said: We’ve listened to reports from the angling community and other locals and would like to reassure them that this is the first of many operations we will be carrying out in the area. We are working with the police so it should be no surprise in the future to see us working together to check licences remove illegal nets and deal with the associated problems linked to illegal fishing. We take illegal fishing and illegal fish movements very seriously. Anyone fishing illegally can expect to be prosecuted and face a substantial fine. Many people enjoy angling and we would encourage anyone to give it a try, as there are many great places to fish in the local area. Information on getting into angling is freely available on the internet and information about rod licences and byelaws can be found on the Environment Agency website. Anyone who witnesses or has information regarding illegal fishing is encouraged to report it through the Environment Agency’s Incident Hotline on 0800 80 70 60. Anyone fishing illegally can expect to be prosecuted and face a fine of up to £2,500 and up to £50,000 for byelaw offences. Last year, the Environment Agency checked over 62,000 rod licences and prosecuted more than 1,900 anglers for rod and line offences resulting in fines and costs in excess of £500,000. Fishing is great value for money at just £27 for an annual licence, and concessions available.

/government/news/notorious-hants-waste-criminal-sentenced-to-30-weeks-imprisonment,"The Environment Agency has prosecuted a previously convicted Hampshire waste boss for a further string of offences in the county. Notorious Hants waste criminal sentenced to 30 weeks imprisonment  Environment Agency The Environment Agency, in partnership with Test Valley Borough Council, Southampton City Council and Hampshire Police, has prosecuted a previously convicted Hampshire waste boss for a further string of offences in the county. Marcus Bairstow, 41, of Chelveston Crescent, Southampton appeared before Southampton Crown Court on Wednesday 14 September and pleaded guilty to a total of 5 offences. Mr Bairstow was sentenced to 30 weeks imprisonment and ordered to pay a victim surcharge of £150. The judge, Miss Recorder Bussey-Jones, said Bairstow committed deliberate acts which were carried out for financial gain and were a flagrant breach of his court order. The Court heard that Mr Bairstow was convicted in March 2011 following a major multi-agency investigation into the dumping of waste in the county. He collected waste in Southampton and took it out into the countryside to fly tip. He was convicted on numerous counts and given 2 years in prison and an Anti Social Behaviour Order (ASBO) for 5 years. The order bans him from most waste activities other than lawfully carrying waste. He was also exposed by the BBC’s Rogue Traders programme which bugged and tracked waste and filmed Bairstow dumping it. In May 2015, Bairstow began to rent a small plot of land at Park Farm, Stoneham Lane at Eastleigh. He told the owner he wanted to bring skips and sort waste on site in addition to burning it. Fires started to occur as waste accumulated until a large blaze occurred in July. Fire and police services attended and discovered that a fire on site had ignited a tree and fencing which subsequently set alight timber belonging to a builder in an adjacent unit. Bairstow attended the site and gave his details to a police officer and admitted his responsibility and that he had insurance. Before this, in January 2015, a developer had waste on site at Padwell Road in Southampton which was collected by Bairstow. Subsequently a farmer found that entry to his land near Rownhams had been forced, and this waste had been dumped there. Also a van belonging to Bairstow was seen in the car park of the Talking Heads public House in Portswood in February 2015. Two men, one of which was identified as Bairstow, tipped large quantity of waste from the truck as it left the car park. Bairstow was arrested in September last year for the new offences and breach of his ASBO. Nigel Oliver of the Environment Agency said: We are constantly gathering information on illegal waste sites, criminal activities and environmental crime in Hampshire and across the country as a whole. Together with our partners we are taking a zero tolerance approach against waste offenders. In cases like this where individuals such as Mr Bairstow consistently operate illegally, we have absolutely no hesitation in prosecuting them. Bairstow was clearly aware of his obligations and responsibilities in the handling and treatment of waste but yet again wilfully ignored them, putting the local environment at repeated risk. I hope today’s ruling serves as a deterrent to any individual or company in showing that waste crime does not pay."
/government/consultations/leicester-flood-risk-management-strategy,"Help us determine the environmental impacts we need to consider as part of the Leicester Integrated Flood Risk Management Strategy (IFRMS).  Leicester Flood Risk Management Strategy  Environment Agency The Environment Agency (EA) has produced a strategic environmental assessment (SEA) which aims to identify environmental and possibly other sustainability aspects to be considered in policy, plan and programme making. This scoping document establishes which environmental criteria need to be included and assessed as part of the Leicester Integrated Flood Risk Management Strategy (IFRMS). It will ensure the risk of flooding from all sources is properly managed by using the full range of options in a co-ordinated way. The IFRMS should establish: a better understanding of the risk of flooding from all sources that the EA and others have long term plans in place to manage these risks that communities understand risk and take action that new development is both appropriate and safe that wider environmental objectives and other benefits are achieved. This includes delivering Water Framework Directive outcomes that better detection, forecasting and issue of warnings enables the EA and Leicester City Council to minimise the consequences of flooding from any source, and co-ordinate effective response to flood emergencies and faster recovery that EA capital and revenue investment needs to be identified and targeted at those communities at highest risk"
/government/news/200000-of-rod-licence-money-to-fund-over-50-angling-projects,"Projects will encourage school children to get involved and will help tackle predation £200,000 of rod licence money to fund over 50 angling projects  Environment Agency The Angling Improvement Fund (AIF) has funded 54 projects to encourage freshwater fishing. The £200,000 of rod licence money will protect fisheries from predation, encourage more people to go fishing, improve facilities at clubs and fisheries and safeguard venues. The AIF is administered by the Angling Trust in partnership with the Environment Agency. Every project has also attracted financial or in-kind support through match-funding. This means that AIF funded schemes have benefitted from over £500,000. Sarah Chare, Deputy Director for Fisheries at the Environment Agency, said: If you buy a rod licence from the Post Office then you are helping to protect and improve fisheries through the Angling Improvement Fund. These 54 projects will improve the facilities that anglers tell us they want most and encourage new people to try fishing. Angling is great for people’s health and anglers help to protect the environment, so we want to get as many people involved as possible. Mark Lloyd, Chief Executive of the Angling Trust, said: The Angling Improvement Fund has been a great success in ensuring that there is a transparent and fair process for clubs, fisheries and community groups to apply for the funds available. The funding awards have been given to those who can demonstrate that they will make the biggest impact for the good of fishing, not only by attracting match funding but also by working in partnership and involving the local community in their plans. It’s vital that we get the best value for money from the funds raised from anglers buying rod licences. Congratulations to everyone who has contributed to the success of the fund and I look forward to hearing about more excellent projects in the next round. The schemes were awarded funding under the following four themes: Otter-proof fencing Unsustainable predation by otters can effect angling venues and has become an issue of major concern to anglers, 8 otter-proof fencing projects from commercial fisheries and clubs were selected for funding. Community waters Funding was allocated to 18 projects involving park ponds and other types of ‘community water’ such as fishable rivers and canals in towns and cities. Being close to urban areas they offer unparalleled opportunities to get out fishing, safely, cheaply and close to where many people live. Schools and colleges The AIF funded 7 projects connecting with children with angling, boosting confidence and offering valuable learning opportunities and life skills. Best unfunded proposals from previous rounds More than 300 applications were submitted to the first 2 rounds of the AIF, many more than could be funded. The judging panel reviewed past entries and funded 21 projects, including 17 focused on junior angling."
/guidance/flood-and-coastal-defence-appraisal-of-projects,"Steps risk management authorities should take to get technical and financial approval for flood and coastal erosion projects or strategies. Flood and coastal defence: develop a project business case Flooding and coastal change Environment Agency 1. Contact your Environment Agency ( EA ) Area Flood and Coastal Risk Manager Once you have identified a need and your project is included in the programme of flood and coastal erosion risk management schemes , tell your Area Flood and Coastal Risk Manager that you are starting your appraisal. You can arrange support to do this from EA with your Area Flood and Coastal Risk Manager. This may include help with the economic appraisal. You’ll also agree a submission date with them. 2. Follow the appraisal process This stage identifies the preferred approach to reduce the risk of flood or coastal erosion. The outcome of the appraisal process is a business case for the project you are developing. By following EA ’s appraisal guidance , you will keep to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs ( Defra ’s) policy statement . The appraisal process applies to new and on-going flood and coastal erosion risk management ( FCERM ) strategies and projects funded by government. This includes those carried out by maritime local authorities. They have coastal erosion responsibilities under the Coast Protection Act 1949. There is more appraisal guidance for specific tasks that you might carry out during an appraisal: FCERM economic appraisal spreadsheet assist economic analysis appraisal summary table supporting note enables the clear presentation of negative and positive impacts to aid the consideration of wider issues within the appraisal apply the scoring and weighting methodology to complete economic valuations of more intangible benefit types adapting to climate change demonstrates how risk management authorities can account for climate change within their FCERM investment decisions risk to people guidance covers a method for the evaluation of the risk to life associated with flood risks interim guidance note takes account of Defra ’s policy on socio-economic equity and appraisal of human-related impacts of flooding treatment of risk describes the latest approach to project optimism bias There is also supporting guidance for tasks that you do in certain circumstances during an appraisal: economic evaluation of environmental effects assists in applying a monetary value to environmental effects associated with FCERM schemes assessment of coastal erosion and landsliding provides guidance on coastal erosion, cliff instability and coastal landslides treatment of agricultural land provides an update on the valuation of agricultural land and output 3. Complete the templates for technical approval You need to submit the relevant forms with your project business case to get approval. From April 2016, EA will replace the Project Appraisal Report (PAR) with 2 new templates. You need to complete the business case using the template that is appropriate for the cost of your project. This change is to align with HM Treasury’s Five Case Model . Choose the correct template for your appraisal: Short Form Business Case template to request approval of an FCERM scheme with a capital cost less than £2 million Business Case template to request approval of an FCERM scheme with a capital cost more than £2 million Strategy Appraisal Report ( StAR ) - the template provides a basis for writing your strategy – your local EA contact can advise you how to prepare it You should tell your local EA contact when you start to write a business case or a StAR . In accordance with HM Treasury’s Five Case Model, you must develop the business case in 3 phases. Strategic Outline Case ( SOC ) – the case for change. Outline Business Case ( OBC ) – preferred option. Full Business Case ( FBC ) – detailed design and firm prices. You must get technical approval from EA at the OBC stage. EA must notify Defra and HM Treasury if the whole life cost of your project is likely to exceed £50 million. If this is the case, you must submit an SOC to EA before developing your business case further. A FBC will also be required. Choose the correct form for flood risk schemes: FCERM2 - application for grant funding form to apply for funding to undertake an FCERM scheme FCERM7 - application for studies and strategies approval form to apply for funding to undertake an FCERM study For an FCERM7, you can present the study in a format of your choice and a strategy on the strategy appraisal report ( StAR ) template. A study could lead to a strategy, a management plan, investigate options for schemes of works, or investigate the environmental impacts of FCERM on an area of statutory environmental designation. The Grant Memorandum explains the full definition. Grant Memorandum 2013 for local authorities and internal drainage boards Grant Memorandum 2016 for local authorities and internal drainage boards The 2011 and 2012 Grant Memorandums are no longer on GOV.UK. You can get a copy of them by emailing LAIDBFINANCE@environment-agency.gov.uk . Use 2 forms for coastal erosion schemes: CPA1 – certificate of statutory consultations and response for coastal erosion schemes CPA2 – application for formal approval of coast protection project You must complete a contributions and efficiencies data sheet for all schemes. This helps to show that EA is meeting government targets. Contact your local EA contact for a copy. Check with your EA Area Flood and Coastal Risk Manager that your project has allocated funding. This might be an indicative allocation of government capital grant, partnership funding or a mixture of both. 4. Send your Short Form or Business Case and application forms to EA Send 2 copies of your completed business case and the forms to your Area Flood and Coastal Risk Manager either by email or by post. You can submit the copies on a CD/DVD. If the cost of the project is less than £100,000, your Area Flood and Coastal Risk Manager can approve it. If the cost of the project is £100,000 or more then you may need to attend a technical review meeting. 5. Attend a technical review meeting EA Large Project Review Group ( LPRG ) assures projects that cost more than £10 million (or if there are significant environmental impacts). EA National Project Assurance Service ( NPAS ) assures projects that cost between £100,000 and £10 million. Once your project is assured, EA will recommend your project for financial approval. To get assurance from LPRG , your project executive or project manager will need to present it at an LPRG meeting and answer any questions. EA will provide feedback immediately if you attend the meeting or in 2 to 4 weeks if you don’t. To get assurance from NPAS you don’t usually need to attend a face-to-face meeting. Your project executive or manager may need to answer technical questions through correspondence or teleconferences. This could take approximately 2 to 3 weeks. Projects that are estimated to be between £2 million and £10 million may need a face-to-face meeting. After NPAS assure your project it will go forward for financial approval. Defra will determine the assurance and approval arrangements for projects with an estimated whole life cost of more than £50 million. 6. Get financial approval (excluding coastal erosion work) Once approved, your Area Flood and Coastal Risk Manager will write to you with a grant approval number. You’ll need this to apply for capital grant in aid payments. 7. Coastal erosion work (excluding studies): tendering stage The process is different for coastal erosion work (excluding studies). To get technical approval you should send a CPA1 to them with your OBC to the Area Flood and Coastal Risk Manager. After technical approval, you can ask for tenders to do the work. To apply for formal grant approval you need to send the CPA2 , with supporting information (usually a FBC which is the OBC updated with tender prices and the tender assessment report) to the Area Flood and Coastal Risk Manager . They will pass this to the Director of FCRM and the business finance department for financial approval. After the tendering stage, your Area Flood and Coastal Risk Manager will write to you with a grant approval number. You’ll need this to apply for capital grant-in-aid payments. 8. Exceptions to the process: emergency works You do not need to wait for formal approval from EA to carry out emergency works (section 5 (6) of the Coast Protection Act). But, if you intend to claim capital grant-in-aid for emergency works you will need to seek both technical and financial approval as soon as possible from: your Area Flood and Coastal Risk Manager at EA the Director of FCRM at EA your contact in EA business finance If you need to do emergency works on designated environmental sites, you must seek approval from Natural England. You will not be able to claim capital grant in aid without this approval.

/government/news/fishy-activities-reeled-in-by-enforcement-team,"Environment Agency enforcement officers have been patrolling for illegal fishing activities Fishy activities reeled in by enforcement team  Environment Agency Fisheries Enforcement Officers have had a busy week patrolling the river banks from Scunthorpe to Leicestershire. The Environment Agency staff who are funded by rod licence income have identified 4 cases of fish poaching, removed 3 illegal nets and confiscated a number of fishing rods and other equipment from the illegal anglers. They intercepted the removal of eels perch, chub and bream being taken away from the Rivers Torne, Trent and Soar and 5 individuals will face appropriate enforcement action. Peter Haslock, Enforcement Team Leader at the Environment Agency, said: “We take illegal fishing and illegal fish movements very seriously. Anyone fishing illegally can expect to be prosecuted and face a substantial fine. “Our officers are out and about on the river banks on a daily basis, responding to reports of illegal activity and checking fishing licences. “Illegal fishing can harm fish stocks and avoiding the licence fee means less money is spent protecting our rivers and improving facilities for anglers.” Information on getting into angling is freely available on the internet and information about rod licences and byelaws can be found on the Environment Agency website. Anyone who witnesses or has information regarding illegal fishing is encouraged to report it through the Environment Agency’s Incident Hotline on 0800 80 70 60. Anyone fishing illegally can expect to be prosecuted and face a fine of up to £2,500 and up to £50,000 for byelaw offences. Last year, the Environment Agency checked over 62,000 rod licences and prosecuted more than 1,900 anglers for rod and line offences resulting in fines and costs in excess of £500,000. Fishing is great value for money at just £27 for an annual licence, and concessions available. Buying a rod licence is quick and easy - you can buy them online at the Post Office , at your local Post Office branch or by phoning 0344 800 5386. All rod licence income is used to fund work to protect and improve fish stocks and fisheries. Our work includes responding to fish kills and, where we can, rescuing fish; improving habitats for fish and facilities for anglers, protecting stocks from illegal fishing, plus fish restocking, invasive species eradication, and working with partners to encourage people to take-up fishing for the first time."
/government/news/fishing-cheats-land-big-fines-in-court,"Two London anglers each had penalties imposed of over £450 at St Albans Magistrates' Court on 21 September 2016.  Fishing cheats land big fines in court  Environment Agency The men were fined for fishing without a rod licence and taking fish without permission, in contravention of national byelaws and schedule 1 of the Theft Act, at a trout fishery in Ware, Hertfordshire. Leonidas Kupcikovas, Ilford IG6 and Slavkas Kupcikovas, London E7, were caught by the police fishing at night and were each fined £330 (plus £127 costs and £33 victim surcharge), when an Environment Agency annual licence costs just £27. Environment Manager Debbie Jones said: We check licences across all fisheries in Hertfordshire, and work in partnership with fishery owners and the police to detect and deter fisheries crime. People who don’t buy a licence are cheating other anglers and the future of the sport. The Environment Agency relies on the income from rod licences to continue the important work we do to protect fish stocks, improve fisheries and encourage more people to take up fishing. If you are caught fishing without a rod licence you risk a criminal conviction and a fine up to £2,500. There is no excuse – annual rod licences for trout and coarse fishing remain at £5 for 12 to 16 year olds, £18 for senior and disabled concessions and £27 for non-concessions. Children under 12 can fish for free. Licences are easy to buy from the Post Office website or by phone on 0344 800 5386 prior to fishing. Anglers should always ensure they have permission to fish at a fishery and check Environment Agency byelaws. Last year, Environment Agency officers checked more than 62,000 licences and prosecuted more than 1,900 licence cheats. Between them, they were ordered to pay fines and costs in excess of £600,000. To help crack down on unlicensed fishing the Environment Agency urges anyone to report illegal activity by calling 0800 80 70 60 or anonymously to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111. Money raised from rod licence sales is reinvested in the environment, including a whole range of projects to improve facilities for anglers, protect stocks from illegal fishing, plus fish restocking, invasive species eradication, and working with partners to encourage people to take-up fishing for the first time."

/government/news/illegal-angler-catches-487-penalty,"On the 28 September 2016, Lloyd Sims of Ashbourne Road, Rocester appeared at Stafford Magistrates’ Court charged with fisheries offences. Illegal angler catches £487 penalty  Environment Agency He was fined £330 for fishing without a rod licence and for fishing during freshwater close season, with costs of £127 and a victim surcharge of £30. Magistrates heard that on the 9 May 2016, an Environment Agency enforcement officer found Mr Sims fishing on the River Dove. A valid rod licence is required to fish all waters in England. Mr Sims was not able to produce a valid rod licence and was reported for that offence. Mr Simms was also reported for fishing on a river during close season. Close season seeks to protect fish during their breeding season, helping to increase fish stocks and secure angling for the future. Mick Hyde, Environment Agency Enforcement said: “Across the country, we’re continuing to see similar fines handed out to anglers fishing illegally. Having to pay over £400 for a day of fishing just doesn’t make sense; especially when the cost of an annual licence is as little as £27. We are delighted that these fines send such a clear message to rod licence cheats – fishing without a licence is not worth the risk.” Every year, nearly 1 million anglers fish legally, respecting each other and the sport. The money they pay to buy a licence supports fish, fisheries and fishing and protects the future of the sport. A small number of anglers refuse to buy a licence, cheating the sport and their fellow anglers. For the minority who flout the rules, the most common offence is fishing without a valid licence; which could land you with a fine of up to £2,500 and a criminal record. Last year the Environment Agency checked more than 62,000 rod licences and prosecuted more than 1,900 anglers for rod and line offences resulting in fines and costs in excess of £500,000. Any angler aged 12 or over, fishing on a river, canal or still water needs a licence. A full rod licence costs from just £27 (concessions available). You can buy your rod licence online from the Post Office , at your local Post Office or by phoning 0344 800 5386. Money from rod licence sales is invested in England’s fisheries, and is used to fund a wide range of projects to improve facilities for anglers including; protecting stocks from illegal fishing, pollution and disease, restoring fish stocks through restocking, eradicate invasive species, and fish habitat improvements. Rod licence money is also used to fund the Angling Trust to provide information about fishing and to encourage participation in the sport.

/government/news/rod-licence-blitz-nets-23-anglers-for-offences-on-lincolnshire-waters,"Environment Agency enforcement officers have been carrying out checks on anglers in Lincolnshire. Rod licence blitz nets 23 anglers for offences on Lincolnshire waters  Environment Agency A number of illegal anglers will be left reeling after being nabbed by Environment Agency officers during a weekend blitz at fishing hotspots across Lincolnshire. The patrols were carried out by Environment Agency enforcement officers who were acting on intelligence to seek out those fishing without a licence. Officers carried out more than 400 checks in more than 60 waters across the county, and 23 anglers were reported for offences including fishing without a licence. They now face further action and, if found guilty in court, could face fines of up to £2,500. Peter Stark, Senior Enforcement Officer at the Environment Agency, said: “The number of anglers caught red-handed is testament to how seriously we at the Environment Agency take illegal fishing, which disregards the law and the health of fisheries. “People who don’t buy a licence are not only cheating other anglers and the future of the sport but running the risk of criminal conviction and a fine. There is no excuse – it costs just £27 for a whole year and you can buy it from the Post Office website.” Every year nearly 1 million anglers fish legally, respecting each other and the sport.

/government/news/fisherman-who-gave-fake-name-caught-on-facebook,"An angler caught fishing without a rod licence thought he got away with it when he gave a bailiff his friend's name. Then we tracked him down on Facebook. Fisherman who gave fake name caught on Facebook  Environment Agency A Somerset man caught fishing without a rod licence tried to avoid prosecution by taking on his friend’s identity. But Thomas Dalziel’s plan backfired after an Environment Agency bailiff recognised the licence-dodger on Facebook. Dalziel had earlier borrowed some fishing gear from his friend, Lee Brand. He persuaded Brand to cover up for him after he was caught without a rod licence on 21 May 2014. Dalziel then purchased a day licence from a post office in the name of Lee Brand, but gave his own date of birth. On 20 November 2014 the court received a letter from Mr Brand saying he’d been the victim of fraud/mistaken identity. He claimed he’d been ‘victimised’ and refused to pay the fine. On the day Dalziel was caught, an Environment Agency bailiff saw a BMW car parked nearby. When the officer checked the current keeper details, Dalziel’s name came up. He later recognised Dalziel on Facebook as the fisherman he’d met. Lee Brand was interviewed and admitted he and Dalziel were good friends. He knew Dalziel had purchased a rod licence in his name and admitted covering up for him. Lee Brand said he had earlier asked his friend to own up to the offence, but Dalziel refused to do so. He had also claimed his fishing gear had been stolen from his shed when, in actual fact, he knew Dalziel had borrowed it. Chris Povey of the Environment Agency said: This was a deliberate attempt to evade justice by an angler assuming a false identity. It was made possible through the participation of a second person who knowingly took part in the deception. Lee Brand was given a 12 month conditional discharge and ordered to pay £600 costs at an earlier hearing after pleading guilty to fraud by false representation. Police were unable to trace Dalziel until 3 October 2016 when he handed himself into the police in Bristol. He was held in custody for 30 hours until his case could be heard on Tuesday, 4 October 2016. Appearing before Bristol magistrates, Thomas Dalziel of Bradford Park, Foxhill, Bath was also ordered to pay £600 costs and given a 12 month conditional discharge after pleading guilty to fraud by false representation.

/government/news/event-brings-volunteer-flood-wardens-together,"Environment Agency hosts event to say thank you and bring the North East's Flood Warden groups together.  Event brings volunteer Flood Wardens together  Environment Agency Teams of volunteer flood wardens across the North East are playing a vital role in helping protect their communities. From Cleveland to Northumberland, there are groups of flood wardens in communities in the North East. And last week, the Environment Agency hosted an event to say thank you, to bring groups together in one place and show how by working together they can be more resilient to flooding. Flood wardens were also given a tour of the North East Area Incident Room, where it was explained to them the steps the Environment Agency takes during an incident. Rachael McFarlane, the Environment Agency’s Flood Resilience Team leader for the North East, hosted the event. She said: “This event was our chance to say thank you to those groups we’ve been working with for years, and to welcome some new groups which have been formed since the flooding last winter. “By bringing the different flood warden groups together, they were able to share ideas about their community flood plan, and learn from each other’s experiences. “The local knowledge flood wardens can provide on the ground is invaluable. “They complement our work by implementing their community action plans and offer a key point of contact for us to be able to warn and inform.” The flood wardens also heard from Mary Dhonau, often referred to as the ‘Queen of floods’, who talked about her personal experience of being flooded, and how vital it is for communities to at risk to sign up for free flood warnings, and prepare a flood plan. She has worked extensively to be a powerful advocate and voice for communities, and received an OBE for her work. Mary added: “Flood Wardens are often the unsung heroes within a community. I was delighted to talk at this event and to be given the opportunity to thank the wardens for all they do. I enjoyed sharing practical advice and information with them all and feedback from the evening was very positive.” 1 in 6 properties in England are at risk of flooding – that’s almost 5 million people. December 2015 was the wettest month in England since records began in 1910: with an ever-changing climate, the number of homes and businesses that could flood is only going to increase. The worrying fact is that only about half of the people who are in a flood risk area, actually know about it. Start by taking three simple steps to help protect you, your family and home from the devastating effects flooding: Check your flood risk - Use the Environment Agency’s maps to find out if you are at risk from flooding Register for Floodline - Check if free flood warnings are available for your area and register online Do something to be prepared.

/government/news/flood-sirens-put-to-the-test-for-calderdale-exercise,"Training exercise will test the response of emergency services Flood sirens put to the test for Calderdale exercise  Environment Agency The flood warning sirens in Walsden, Todmorden, Hebden Bridge and Mytholmroyd will be sounded this week (Friday 14 October) as part of a live training exercise across the valley. Calderdale Council is holding its biggest ever live training exercise and the Environment Agency is taking the opportunity to test the flood sirens. Operation Calderdale16 will test the emergency response of the council, the Environment Agency, emergency services and partners to a major flooding incident, including a live search and rescue. The Environment Agency uses the sirens to warn the Upper Calder Valley communities when rivers are expected to flood. There are eight sirens in the area with an audibility level similar to that used by emergency vehicles. The sirens will be tested together on Friday 14 October at 10:30am. Each test will last for two minutes. Residents and businesses in the towns do not need to take any action when hearing the sirens at these times. Loud hailer vehicles will be used to alert people to the tests, ahead of the sirens being sounded. Joanna Arnold, Environment Agency Flood Resilience Advisor said: It is important that we test the sirens to check that they are working properly and can be triggered remotely from our incident room in Leeds. This exercise is a great opportunity not only to test the sirens, but our response to a flood incident with our partners. Although no action needs to be taken during the test, people need to be aware that if they hear the sirens at any other time, then this means that flooding is expected. Flood water is dangerous, particularly in these areas where water cascading down from the steep surrounding hills means flooding can happen very quickly and with little warning. We would ask people not to put themselves at danger by driving or walking through fast moving flood water. We are also encouraging local residents and businesses to put together a flood plan to keep themselves and their families safe. For the latest information on current flood warnings and the local weather forecast, Calderdale residents can visit the ‘Eye on Calderdale’ website at www.eyeoncalderdale.com .

/government/news/tidal-flood-risk-in-thames-estuary-increases-in-line-with-predictions,"The Environment Agency presented today (13 October 2016) its 5 year review of tidal flood risk indicators in the Thames estuary.  Tidal flood risk in Thames estuary increases in line with predictions  Environment Agency The review shows that, although tidal flood risk is increasing, it is in line with the forecasts on which its Thames Estuary 2100 (TE2100) flood risk management plan is based. The TE2100 plan sets out how increasing flood risk in the Thames estuary can be managed through to the end of the century. The review, presented today at ‘Flood Expo’, Excel Centre, London, looks at 10 indicators, reflecting different aspects of tidal flood risk, to see how they have changed since the original TE2100 plan. Any changes to those indicators, if not predicted in the plan, could result in bringing forward, or safely deferring, the flood risk management activities and investment needed to keep people and property safe over the century. The review found that: sea levels in the estuary have continued to rise within the bounds predicted by the TE2100 plan the amount of people and property at risk has increased, with over £275 billion of residential property, and 1.3 million people living within the tidal floodplain in London and the Thames estuary; an increase of £75 billion and 50,000 respectively since the original Thames Estuary 2100 plan assessment 98% of the 3,800 flood defence structures in the estuary are currently in good or fair condition analysis of trends in tidal surge heights and river flows gave no indication that these factors are currently increasing flood risk in the estuary although the Thames barrier operated 50 times in the winter of 2013/14, this has reverted to a more typical pattern of operation in subsequent years and the overall trend of closures over time does not currently indicate that the frequency of required operation is increasing based on the results, the timings of the flood risk management actions set out in the TE2100 plan remain appropriate Howard Davidson, Operations Director at the Environment Agency, said: This report shows that we can monitor how flood risk in the estuary is changing. This is fundamental in being able to continue to manage that risk and keep people safe. It also shows that the scenarios and models used to create the Thames Estuary 2100 Plan are still valid. It gives us and our partners, who have a role in reducing flood risk, confidence to continue the actions set out in the plan; maintaining a high standard of protection for London and estuary communities. The review is the first of many over 5 year intervals which will track the indicators of flood risk over the century. It will adapt as improvements in methods for collecting data are developed. The next review will be in 2020 when the full TE2100 plan will be reviewed."

Along with 2 other full-time lock and weir keeper appointments we made in earlier in the year, they underscore our commitment to retain resident lock and weir keepers at sites where there is an operational need. John O’Hara will be the new lock keeper at Radcot Lock near Faringdon in Oxfordshire; Mark Winks at Osney Lock in Oxford, Aiden Mahon at Iffley Lock, also in Oxford; and Katie Marshall at Romney Lock, near Windsor in Berkshire. Mark and Katie are already resident lock and weir keepers; at Northmoor Lock near Appleton, and Benson Lock near Wallingford - both in Oxfordshire - respectively. John and Aiden are currently ‘relief’ ‘keepers, which means they provide support and cover for residents when they are on a day off, on holiday or unwell, and travel to wherever they are needed from their own homes. Barry continued: John, Mark, Aiden and Katie are all high calibre individuals – experienced, capable, diligent and very well thought of by boaters and colleagues alike. I’m really pleased they all got the moves they wanted, which they fully deserve. I’m also pleased for the communities they are moving into, and which I hope they will part of for many years to come – as were their predecessors, who between them, gave us nigh on 75 years of sterling service. That’s Kevin Roberts at Radcot, Ray Riches at Osney, Iain Westwood at Iffley, and Dave Ford at Romney. They will all be missed - but I genuinely couldn’t wish for 4 better people to take on their roles. John, Mark, Aiden and Katie will move to their new sites, and into their new homes, over the coming weeks."
/government/news/fish-stocks-boost-for-north-east-rivers,"Environment Agency's fisheries experts have released more than 5,000 fish into North East waters  Fish stocks boost for North East rivers  Environment Agency Fisheries experts have released more than 5,000 fish into North East waters as part of the Environment Agency’s ongoing plans to develop and restore rivers. On Monday 17 October barbel were released into the River Skerne near Darlington, and at Clow Beck near Croft to help restore fish stocks and improve angling. The Environment Agency releases fish into our waterways annually. Fisheries officers target fish stocking activity using data from national fish surveys to identify where there are problems with poor breeding and survival. Environment Agency fisheries officer Paul Frear introduced the fish to their new homes. He said: “We’re pleased that we can provide these fish for stocking as part of our commitment to rod licence paying anglers. “Restoration and the creation of new fisheries for all people to enjoy is a very important aspect of our work.” The River Skerne above Darlington has suffered from poor water quality and habitat degradation in the past, but a concerted effort by the Environment Agency has helped to turn this watercourse around. The fish all come from the Environment Agency’s Fish farm at Calverton, in Nottinghamshire, where around 450,000 fish are produced to stock rivers across the country each year. Many of our industrialised rivers have improved dramatically in water quality in the last 30 years and concerted restocking has accelerated the restoration of natural fish stocks and viable fisheries. Angling is a great way for everyone to keep healthy and enjoy the natural environment. All rod licence income is used to fund work to protect and improve fish stocks and fisheries. The rod licence is great value for money, at just £27 for an annual licence. It’s easy to buy at the Post Office online"
/government/news/environment-agency-raid-on-illegal-transfrontier-waste-shipment,"The Environment Agency and partners raided a site on the Essex and East London border, to tackle illegal waste exporters. Environment Agency raid on illegal transfrontier waste shipment  Environment Agency Greenstore Ltd is a large storage facility at Baldwin’s Farm, Upminster, Essex where containers are rented out to individuals and companies for storage. The Environment Agency had information to suggest that the site was being frequented by criminals to store Waste Electronic and Electrical Equipment (WEEE), and stolen goods prior to illegal export. Environment Agency officers entered the site on Wednesday 12 October 2016 and opened the storage containers, using force where necessary. They found activities which could harm the environment including: 1000s of pieces of Waste Electronic and Electrical Equipment such as broken fridges, computers and televisions ready for illegal export to Africa more than 900 stolen gas bottles worth more than £50,000, some still containing gas, which are banned for export stolen cable, vehicles and plant, including a machine stolen in December 2015 which was one of only 50 in the world The laws covering waste exports are strict but clear – it is illegal to export hazardous waste such as Waste Electronic and Electrical Equipment (WEEE) to non-OECD countries. The maximum penalty for exporting waste illegally is an unlimited fine and/or a prison sentence. The Environment Agency was joined by Police, Immigration Enforcement, Calor Gas, Synergy, Flow Gas, HMRC, NaVCIS, the Met and Essex Police stolen plant team, whilst London Fire Brigade and Essex Fire Brigade were also on hand to provide support and ensure safety of the site. As gas bottles are always the property of the brand owner any attempt to export them is against the law. Undeclared hazardous goods such as these pose a significant risk to shipping and ports. Chris Smith, National Intelligence Manager, whose team led the operation for the Environment Agency, said: The sheer volume of material that we and our partner organisations found today and prevented from being exported illegally is a big win, but the battle isn’t over. Today’s action sends a strong message that we will track down those involved in illegal waste activity. The effects of exporting waste illegally is harmful to the environment and the economy. It undercuts legitimate businesses and causes harm to human health and the environment in destination countries where it is often burnt in open fires to recover precious metals. Waste crime is a serious issue diverting as much as £1 billion per annum from legitimate business and treasury. Since April 2011 the Environment Agency has invested £65.2 million in tackling it. Anyone with information about suspected illegal waste operators should call the Environment Agency’s incident helpline on 0800 807060 or call Crimestoppers in confidence on 0800 555 111."

/government/news/are-you-disposing-of-your-oil-or-fuel-correctly,"Worcester businesses and residents reminded to make sure oil and fuel is stored and disposed of correctly and safely. Are you disposing of your oil or fuel correctly?  Environment Agency The Environment Agency is urging businesses and householders in the Ronkswood, Brickfields, Tolladine and Rainbow Hill areas of Worcester to check their oil tanks and ensure that they dispose of oil and fuel in a correct and safe way. Over the past few weeks Environment Agency officers have dealt with a number of incidents where oil has polluted the Worcester and Birmingham Canal in the centre of Worcester, impacting a 2 mile stretch of the waterway and led to 7 swans requiring treatment from Wychbold Swan Rescue and Bishops Wood Swan Rescue. Investigations suggest the substance is diesel and had been entering the canal via one of its numerous tributaries, many of which have been covered over time so are not easily visible. There are a number of Household Recycling Centres which will happily accept small quantities of oil from members of the public. Businesses must ensure their waste oil is collected by a registered waste carrier, which can be found on the GOV.UK public register webpage. Dave Throup from the Environment Agency said: We are working with the Canal and River Trust to stop diesel and other oils entering the canal, and to trace the source of this oil. We are asking businesses and householders in Worcestershire to check any oil tanks or underground oil pipes on their property to make sure they aren’t leaking, and to make people aware never to pour oil or fuel down the drain. The Worcester and Birmingham Canal was built along the path of the Frog Brook and research suggests it drains water away from the south and east of Worcester. The tributaries of the Frog Brook were bricked over and it’s suspected many areas of east Worcester drain into the canal via these old lost watercourses. Over many years we have located a large number of these tributaries, but some parts of the old system of brick culverts are still to be rediscovered."
/guidance/waste-recovery-engineering-create-a-construction-quality-plan,"Find out what borehole monitoring and attenuation layers information you must include in your construction quality assurance (CQA) plan. Waste recovery engineering: create a construction quality plan Environmental permits Waste Environment Agency If you want to apply for a bespoke permit to carry out waste recovery to land, you’ll need to carry out a risk assessment to support your application. Your risk assessment may show that you need to do engineering work to: protect the environment from your activity monitor changes to the environment as a result of your activity For example, you may need to build an attenuation layer across the base and sides of the recovery site to protect soil and water. You may also need to install boreholes in the wastes you deposit to monitor for soil gas or to monitor groundwater. You must agree your construction proposals with the Environment Agency before you start work. The Environment Agency will normally accept a single set of construction proposals to cover an attenuation layer for the whole site. If the Environment Agency gives you a permit, you must then submit detailed construction proposals and a construction quality assurance ( CQA ) plan to your local Environment Agency office at least 4 weeks before starting work. Construction quality assurance plan contents Your CQA plan must specify which codes of practice and guidance you plan to follow. It must also show how you’ll make sure that you use suitable materials to construct the attenuation layer and any monitoring infrastructure. Your CQA plan must include certain information. CQA plan information You CQA plan must show this information: the design of the engineered attenuation layer a method statement for the construction and placement of the attenuation layer criteria you will use for rejecting any materials not suitable for the attenuation layer how specific design criteria are to be assessed with clearly defined acceptable limits CQA plan details Your CQA plan must include details of: the records to be kept and methods of reporting the surface water drainage system groundwater monitoring boreholes gas monitoring boreholes permeability testing at a minimum frequency of 4 tests per hectare for sites over a principal aquifer (the CQA engineer must carry out these tests) your field trial to verify the construction method and demonstrate the thickness and equivalent performance of the attenuation layer CQA plan guarantees Your plan must show how you’ll: achieve and check the geotechnical properties of materials you’ll use achieve and check the shape and size of the structure you’re building train site staff on the requirements of the CQA plan, including record keeping and procedures for selecting site-specific material record compliance with the construction method so that the CQA engineer or inspector can audit the records use CQA procedures to make sure that any material used in the attenuation layer is physically and chemically suitable Using waste in your construction works You must only use materials that can achieve the construction and placement of the attenuation layer when you follow your CQA method statement. If you’re going to use waste in your construction works, you must confirm that it’s chemically and physically suitable by: making sure that the waste is from a single source or of a single waste type making sure it meets the definition of inert waste using suitable cohesive material in the attenuation layer (you must test this waste as part of your material assessment) confirming that the attenuation material won’t leach non-hazardous pollutants into groundwater including evidence that the material contains no hazardous substances at sites over a principal aquifer or below the water table CQA supervision The Environment Agency requires different levels of CQA supervision depending on if your site is a secondary or principal aquifer. Secondary aquifer site The CQA engineer must carry out 1 visit per 10,000 cubic metres of attenuation material laid, or 1 visit for each 2 weeks of engineering works. Principal aquifer site The CQA engineer must carry out 1 visit per 5,000 cubic metres of attenuation material laid or 1 visit for each week of engineering works. The CQA engineer must be appropriately qualified and have at least 6 months’ experience of earthworks on landfill or recovery sites. An appropriate qualification is a formal qualification in science or engineering.

Thank you to the volunteers from the River Thames  Environment Agency As a ‘thank you’ to our volunteer lock keepers, the Environment Agency will be hosting a celebration on board the French Brothers ‘The New Queen of the Thames’, which is the largest boat on the Upper Thames. Demetri Somarakis, Environment Agency Thames Volunteer Team Project Manager, said: Our volunteers help ensure that the navigational Thames is running both efficiently and safely throughout the summer. Once again we have exceeded previous year’s figures of attendance and I am very proud to say we are now up to 252 volunteers, our highest number of active volunteers since we began in 2011. Today is the day where we can thank and award our volunteers for all their hard work and commitment to the River. Since 2011 the Volunteer Assistant Lock Keeper project has prospered with numbers of volunteers increasing. John Stevenson from Woodstock, Oxford, who has been volunteering at Eynsham Lock since 2013 said: I absolutely love it! The people you meet are always in a happy mood and it’s a great way to stay fit – far better than going to the gym. I just don’t want to give it up. I thoroughly recommend it! Volunteers will embark on the French Brothers ‘The New Queen of the Thames’ for a trip around the Windsor area, followed by an awards presentation where Peter Ainsworth, Environment Agency Board Member will award volunteers for their service. Chris French who is the managing director of the French Brothers fleet said: We are a family business who have been operating on the Thames since 1978. We run trips, services and private charters in the middle Thames and are very happy to be hosting this event once again. The River Thames Volunteers are a fantastic, helpful bunch who work alongside the experienced lock and weir keepers. They always offer assistance to my crews. They provide an important addition to the safe operation of the locks and positively contribute to the smooth passage of boat traffic on the Thames. The River Thames Volunteer Team of the Environment Agency are keen on hearing from anyone who is interested in helping on the Thames for summer 2017. Training will be provided for all successful candidates, as well as a selection of branded uniform. The Environment Agency will also provide the best opportunities for volunteers to increase their knowledge of the River Thames while building on their passion for the river. As well as helping boats to pass through the lock, volunteers can use what they know about the Thames and its surroundings to help inform visitors about all it has to offer. Enthusiasm, a willingness to learn and a helpful nature are the main attributes required. Notes to editors Lock volunteers need to be relatively fit as the role involves lots of physical activity especially walking up and down the lock side. A keen interest in river life is advantageous and candidates need to be able to offer at least 1 day per week between May and October. The River Thames is a destination for boating enthusiasts throughout the year, but during the summer it becomes the focus of activity for boaters, walkers, festivals and events especially at weekends.

/government/news/bank-strengthening-work-starts-in-collingham,"Repairs to 40 metres of river bank will protect properties Bank strengthening work starts in Collingham  Environment Agency Environment Agency contractors have started work on the banks of the River Wharfe in Collingham, near Wetherby, to repair damage to the river bank and protect flood defences. Work is underway to repair approximately 40 metres of river bank in Collingham adjacent to the flood defences at The Avenue, so that it is ready for the winter season. Contractors are expected to be on site until Friday 28 October. The bank needs repairing because further loss of material could damage or weaken the defences at Collingham. Tom Pardey, project manager at the Environment Agency said: We are installing rock armour along the base of the bank, where the material was washed away during the Boxing Day floods. We’ll then reinstate the bank behind it. We apologise for any disruption or noise this may cause residents on the Kingfisher estate and the Avenue, and thank them for their understanding and cooperation while we complete this crucial work. This work is one of many projects we’ve been doing along the Wharfe to repair damage done by floods and get our defences back to standard for the winter season. These repair works are part of the Environment Agency’s asset repair programme, put in place to repair the region’s flood defences which were damaged by the Christmas floods. Officers have checked 8,500 assets and cleared obstructions such as collapsed bridges, buildings, thousands of tonnes of gravel, debris and vehicles from rivers to reduce further flood risk at 150 locations. Since the Christmas floods, the Environment Agency has also carried out bank repairs on Millbeck Green in Collingham. The flood warning area has also been reviewed and adjustments have been made. We have since installed an alarm that allows us to issue a flood warning from telemetry in the Wharfe at The Avenue, Collingham. A flood warning was not issued to properties in Collingham on Boxing Day as the alarms further up the catchment were not triggered, and there was no alarm on the telemetry at Collingham to alert officers to the situation. Other watercourses feeding into the river further downstream may have caused the heightened river flows through Collingham. Improving the telemetry network will enable the flood warning system to better inform communities when overtopping of rivers is expected. This includes Tadcaster as well as Collingham and Ulleskelf. The Environment Agency will soon be sharing a plan explaining what other activities we are undertaking within the Wharfe catchment to reduce flooding. Residents and businesses can check to see if you are eligible for the Environment Agency’s free flood warning service and sign up by calling Floodline on 0345 988 1188 or by visiting the website . As well as checking flood risk, residents can also find out what action they can take to protect their personal safety and property by visiting the Environment Agency website at www.gov.uk/floodsdestroy .

/government/news/community-event-marks-flood-scheme-official-opening,"Newcastle's Brunton Park flood scheme official opening event is attended by residents young and old.  Community event marks flood scheme official opening  Environment Agency A community celebration to officially open Brunton Park flood scheme in Newcastle has seen residents young and old join in the fun. The event – held at St Aidan’s Community Centre at Princes Road on Monday (24 Oct) - included cake, face painting, children’s activities and information stands as well as a wildlife area to find out more the wildlife in and around the River Ouseburn. There were tours of the £7million scheme so residents could find out more about how the risk of flooding has been reduced. And to mark the officially opening, Northumbrian Water, the Environment Agency and North Gosforth Parish Council planted a tree at Lincoln Green. Joint flood scheme Northumbrian Water and the Environment Agency began the joint flood reduction scheme in October 2014. It is the first time in the UK that a water company has done construction work on behalf of the Environment Agency. The scheme reduces the risk of flooding to more than 100 properties in Mitford Gardens, Princes Close, Fairway Close, Princes Road, Waterbury Road and Clayworth Road. The three sources of flooding in Brunton Park were from the water company’s surface and foul sewer networks and from the River Ouseburn. Work involved installing 380 metres of new river channel to divert the Ouseburn from the area that suffers from flooding; using the current section of Ouseburn river channel and a new storage basin to drain and store more than seven million litres of surface water; constructing 650 metres of flood defences (walls and earth embankment) and installing two kilometres of new sewer pipe and a new storage tank, which holds up to 450,000 litres of storm sewage. The newly created river channel and storage basin, known as SuDS (sustainable urban drainage system), has also created a valuable wetland habitat for wildlife. Kingfisher perches and an otter holt will also be installed. Residents thanked for patience Paul Davison, Northumbrian Water’s project manager, said: “After two years it’s been great to show the residents what we have been doing and how this project will reduce the risk of flooding to their homes. The community’s response to our presence in Brunton Park for such a long time has been fantastic, so this was a chance to thank them for their patience. “Reducing the risk of flooding is one of Northumbrian Water’s key priorities and the partnership approach taken at Brunton Park, working in this unique way with the Environment Agency, has led to an innovative approach to tackling flood risk for the benefit of this fantastic community.” Tina Robinson, Project Manager for the Environment Agency, added: “The celebration event was a great way of saying thank you to the local community for their patience and co-operation throughout, and to give them a chance to see first-hand the work that has been done to reduce their flood risk. “The Brunton Park scheme is an excellent example of how working in partnership, and tackling flooding at all its sources, can result in an integrated and sustainable solution.” The play park on Lincoln Green had to be removed while this work was carried out. A new play park has been built, in partnership with Newcastle City Council, North Gosforth Parish Council and the local community. Parish councillor Val Hay said: “The event was a lovely occasion for residents, Northumbrian Water, the Environment Agency and ourselves at the parish council to come together to celebrate the opening of the Brunton Park Flood Alleviation Scheme. “Planting the last silver birch was also the culmination of the restoration of the Village Green, which had been affected for nearly two years due to the scheme.”"

The event will be held on the 1 November between 4pm and 7pm at: The Old School Room Ryden Lane Charlton WR10 3LP The new gauge monitors levels on the Merry Brook. Any changes in water levels are recorded and a series of automated alert messages will be issued once river level thresholds are exceeded. The alerts, of which there are 4 levels, can be sent to landlines, mobile phones, email or a mixture of all three. Once registered residents will also receive access to a website where they can monitor levels during periods of wet weather. Representatives from the Environment Agency will be on hand during the drop-in event to explain how the gauges work and what people need to do to sign up to receive the alerts. They will also be able to help visitors produce individual flood plans and provide information about what people can do to protect themselves and their property during a flood. Martin Young from the Environment Agency said: “The Merry Brook reacts rapidly to intense rainfall and is vulnerable to flash flooding, which can occur suddenly with little or no warning. It is important that residents and business owners understand the signs and risks of flash flooding, and take the necessary steps to prepare themselves and their properties. A vital part of this is to register for warnings from the new gauge.”"
/government/news/anglers-urged-to-help-protect-norfolk-broads-pike-stock,"Anglers are reminded to remain by their rods at all times to prevent pike deaths when fishing as winter enforcement patrols start. Anglers urged to help protect Norfolk Broads pike stock  Environment Agency Despite the fearsome reputation of pike and their set of razor sharp teeth, they are surprisingly delicate. The Environment Agency and Pike Anglers Club of Great Britain (PAC) today urge anglers who catch one to treat it with the utmost care to ensure that when it is returned to the water, it can continue to thrive. Work carried out by Environment Agency fisheries experts, together with the angling community, has identified that pike care, welfare and good fishing practices are vital to protect and increase numbers in the Norfolk and Suffolk Broads, which are world-renowned for excellent pike fishing. With the popularity of pike fishing rising, the influx of more pike anglers to the Broads brings a boost to the local economy in the winter season. However, both experienced and inexperienced anglers can unwittingly cause problems for pike stocks and the wider environment. Steve Lane, Fisheries Technical Specialist at the Environment Agency, said: Broadland pike fishing is incredibly important to many anglers and is a significant asset for the local economy. We are working in partnership with the pike angling community to assess stocks and take measures to protect and improve pike angling. Pike are fragile and anglers need to fish for and treat pike with the utmost care and respect now to ensure they can grow on to become the 20 and 30 pound fish we all hope to catch tomorrow. One way anglers can help protect pike stocks is to adhere to the byelaw to never leave baited rods unattended. John Currie, General Secretary of the Pike Anglers Club of Great Britain (PAC) and Chairman of the BASG Pike SubGroup said: If a pike takes a bait and the angler does not react quickly enough, or a boat cuts through the lines, this can result in deep hooked fish which will often die. PAC therefore welcomes the efforts of our local EA fisheries officers to enforce the relevant fisheries byelaws, educate anglers and protect pike fishing. We can all help to protect pike stocks by fishing with care, using appropriate bite indication and safe rigs. Landing nets, padded unhooking mats and tools are all essential to ensure the safe return of the fish we are privileged to catch.” Apart from fishing, pike in the Broads can face many natural pressures, such as salt water travelling too far up rivers during stormy weather, toxic algal blooms and predators. To help protect pike stocks, Environment Agency Fisheries Enforcement Officers are playing an important role this winter, looking out for unattended rods and other poor practice, which is often illegal. Enforcement Team Leader Lesley Robertson said: Our fisheries enforcement officers will be clamping down hard on unacceptable angling practices such as leaving baited rods unattended. We will not hesitate to take enforcement action where anglers are found to be flouting the rules and putting fish stocks at risk. Anyone seeing illegal angling activity should report it to the Environment Agency Hotline number 0800 807060. Anglers new to fishing pike in the Broads can contact the Pike Anglers Club of Great Britain for further information and tuition www.pacgb.co.uk .

In all, 8 lock sites will have a total of £1.2m spent on them – 5 in Oxfordshire and 1 each in Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Surrey. Major works include removing both pairs of lock gates at Shifford Lock near Bampton in Oxfordshire, and Kings Lock in Oxford, so that the frames can be re-faced with new sheets of timber. As each gates weighs around 8 tonnes, they will be removed by crane and transported by low-loader lorry to the Environment Agency’s depot in Osney, near Oxford where its in-house team of specialist craftsmen will carry out the work. At Penton Hook Lock near Staines in Surrey, the downstream gates will be removed so that repairs can be made to the hinges that support them. To do this, the lock chamber will need to be braced and then pumped dry. Before the lock is fully drained, any fish found in it will be safely transferred to the main river – this is normally many hundreds if not thousands of fish. Barry Russell, Waterways Manager, said: We maintain and operate 45 locks in total. These are part of a portfolio of over 1000 navigation structures on the Thames that we look after. Many of these are important heritage assets which we are custodians of on behalf of the nation, and without them, boating on the Thames as we know it simply wouldn’t be possible. So taking good care of them is a huge responsibility for us, but one we’re very proud to have. Funding for the work comes from boat registration fees and government. The annual investment in their upkeep ensures the locks are in good working order, enabling boaters to carry on cruising throughout the 135 miles of navigable waterway from Cricklade in Wiltshire, near the river’s source, to Teddington in south west London, where the river becomes tidal. The work is done during the winter months when there are very few boats on the river. This minimises disruption if locks need to be taken temporarily out of service. Often, the work that is carried out is the culmination of many months, sometimes years, of planning and preparation. As Barry explains: What we do each winter is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of the totality of what’s needed to keep all these structures in a good state of repair. To stay on top of things we’ve got to maintain an accurate understanding of the condition of each and every one, know what work will be necessary, and when, and prepare for that. So whether it’s carrying out a structural survey – above ground or below water - considering the findings, planning and costing the work, seeking funding, sourcing and ordering materials or fabricating parts in our workshops, there’s always something going on. In many ways, it’s like owning and caring for our very own Forth Bridge. Fortunately, the people doing all this work – many of whom are engineers, technicians and other specialists brought in to support us from outside my own waterways team - are as talented and dedicated as anyone could hope for. Between them, and our 60 strong team of full-time lock and weir keepers who operate them, these structures are in very safe hands indeed."
/government/news/averies-brothers-convicted-after-notorious-major-fires,"Company Director, Lee Averies has been given three 12 month prison sentences to run concurrently by Swindon Crown Court today (Thursday 27 October 2016). Averies brothers convicted after notorious major fires  Environment Agency Company Director, Lee Averies has been given three 12 month prison sentences to run concurrently by Swindon Crown Court today (Thursday 27 October 2016). The sentences will be suspended for two years. Lee Averies’ younger brother, David Averies has been ordered to pay over £54,000 in fines and costs. Lee and David Averies appeared at Swindon Crown Court to be sentenced before Sir John Royce (sitting as Deputy High Court Judge) in relation to serious environmental offences committed at their waste sites: Swindon Skips Ltd at Brindley Close, Cheney Manor and Averies Recycling (Swindon) Ltd at Marshgate in Swindon, Wiltshire. Lee Averies was also sentenced for a similar offence at his waste site in Calne, in his capacity as a director of Calne Aggregate Holdings Ltd. A guilty plea has been entered on behalf of the company which will be sentenced after confiscation proceedings are concluded in 2017. Lee Averies, who has accepted he was “reckless”, was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment on for each of the three offences, suspended for two years. He was also made the subject of a Criminal Behaviour Order which effectively prevents him working in the waste industry for five years. A conviction for failing to comply with such an order carries a penalty of up to five years imprisonment, a fine or both. David Averies who accepted he was “negligent”, was ordered to pay fines of £4,208 and costs of £50,000. He was also disqualified from acting as a company director for three years. The offences committed in relation to all three sites relate to the treating, keeping or disposing of waste in a manner likely to cause pollution of the environment or harm to human health due to the inadequate infrastructure, volumes of waste and management of the sites. The charges cover the period when there were two serious fires at their sites in Brindley Close and Marshgate in November 2013 and July 2014 respectively. The operator also failed to comply with the conditions of the permit for the Calne site, where some of the fire affected waste was taken in July 2014. The fire in 2013 at Brindley Close burned for a week and smouldered for some time after - causing disruption to the local community, businesses and delays on the nearby main railway line to Cheltenham. The second fire at the Marshgate site was even more serious and burned for 57 days until mid September 2014. Businesses in the area were severely disrupted and on occasion had to stop trading altogether. Local residents and those who worked in the vicinity were affected by the smoke. Given the severity of the incident a Strategic Co-ordinating Group was convened by the Local Resilience Forum and on 31 July 2014 the fire at the Marshgate site was declared a major incident. The Environment Agency worked with its partner agencies (which included Swindon Borough Council and Wiltshire Fire & Rescue Service) to ensure waste was removed from the site to allow the fire and rescue service to tackle the fire. The defendants were offered the use of a temporary site under a licence from Swindon Borough Council, which they declined. Immediately after the fire at the Marshgate site in 2014, the Environment Agency removed the waste carriers licence from Averies Recycling (Swindon Ltd), as a result the company could no longer collect waste from local businesses or residents. The Environmental permits have been revoked at the Swindon sites, without which a waste transfer station cannot be operated legally. The procedure for revoking the permit at the site operated by Calne Aggregates Holding Limited is also underway. Colin Chiverton, Area Environment Manager for the Environment Agency said: The Environment Agency has worked hard to minimise the disastrous legacy the Averies brothers have left behind. If we and other incident responders had not taken the action we did then the impact on people, the environment and local infrastructure could have been catastrophic. Lee Averies and Averies Recycling (Swindon) Ltd had been convicted of similar offences in 2013 at Bristol Crown Court and despite assurances from Lee Averies to the Court and the Environment Agency that he would comply with the conditions of the permit in future; he continued to manage the sites in a manner which put people, the environment and infrastructure at serious risk. The Environment Agency committed considerable resources in order to provide advice and guidance. Environment Agency officers tried to work with the operators, but after repeated breaches had to take enforcement action and served legal notices on all three sites. The operators’ non-compliance led to a criminal prosecution. Colin Chiverton added: Averies earned huge sums of money by importing waste onto both sites and stockpiling that waste to save on the cost of lawful disposal. They were well aware of the risks of fire and the heightened risk to the environment as a result. They decided to save further expenditure by failing to exercise proper management control of the site and failing to ensure sufficient infrastructure and security for the sites. In his sentencing remarks, Sir John Royce said that Lee Averies’ culpability was at the high end of the reckless category. He also remarked that the incident at Marshgate “was an extremely serious one that lasted 57 days and involved at least 90 staff”. The incident was also the “longest continuous operation by Wiltshire Fire Service had engaged in”. He went on to say that the harm it caused is vividly described by a large number of witnesses whose lives and business were seriously interfered with. It caused distress, anger, disruption and inconvenience. Consideration of any financial penalties and orders for costs in relation to Lee Averies and CAHL have been deferred until POCA is concluded in 2017."

/government/news/west-midlands-man-fined-for-illegal-fishing,"The Environment Agency has prosecuted a man for fishing without a rod licence during closed season. West Midlands man fined for illegal fishing  Environment Agency On the 31 October 2016 at Cheltenham Magistrates Court, Martyn Exall of Kilvert Road, Wednesbury, West Midlands was fined £571 for fishing without a rod licence during the closed season. Magistrates heard that on 7 May 2016 an Environment Agency enforcement officer found Mr Exall fishing at Stanchards Pit on the River Avon, Tewkesbury. A valid rod licence is required to fish all waters in England. He was not able to produce a valid rod licence and was reported for that offence, along with a secondary offence of fishing during the closed season. Close season seeks to protect fish during their breeding season, helping to increase fish stocks and secure angling for the future. Stuart Gamble of the Environment Agency said: “The majority of anglers fish legally and purchase a rod licence. We invest the money from rod licences back into fisheries improvements, fish stocks and fishing, this is essential for the future of the sport. “The minority of anglers that fail to buy a rod licence are cheating their fellow anglers and the future of the sport. In addition rod licence cheats risk a criminal conviction, a significant fine and could lose their fishing equipment.” During 2015-16 the Environment Agency checked more than 62,000 rod licences and prosecuted more than 1,900 anglers for rod and line offences resulting in fines and costs in excess of £500,000. Anyone witnessing illegal fishing incidents in progress can report it directly to the Environment Agency hotline on 0800 80 70 60. Information on illegal fishing and environmental crime can also be reported anonymously to Crime stoppers on 0800 555 111. You need a valid Environment Agency rod licence if you are aged 12 or over and fish for salmon, trout, freshwater fish, smelt or eel in England."

/government/news/sirens-to-be-tested-in-dorset-ahead-of-winter,"The final siren test of the year will make sure Chiswell residents can hear them if there was a winter storm or flood. Sirens to be tested in Dorset ahead of winter  Environment Agency Portland flood sirens will be tested by the Environment Agency on Thursday 10 November 2016, to prepare for any floods this winter. Four sirens, located roughly 250 metres apart in Chiswell, will be activated simultaneously at 11am, 2pm and 5pm, weather permitting. Residents are being informed by visits and leaflets. Nick Lyness, Wessex Flood and Coast Risk Manager at the Environment Agency, said: Regular siren testing is an essential part of our forward planning, not only to ensure we are incident ready, but also to make sure our community flood warning and informing measures are effective. If severe storms hit Portland, the sirens will play a crucial part in alerting local residents to imminent danger and potential evacuation. Ultimately, these sirens could help save lives. Chiswell was badly affected by the floods in 2013/14. It is a vulnerable area and can take a heavy pounding from the sea when the south westerly wind picks up. Although good flood protection measures are in place, we can never fully defend against the worst that nature can throw at us. In Dorset, the Chiswell area of Portland is a high-risk flood area because of strong south-westerly winds, high tides in Lyme Bay and how close properties are to the sea. The sirens, tested twice a year, are extremely loud so they can be heard above the noise of crashing waves during a storm. Modern sirens were installed in 2010 and replaced older Second World War equipment. An additional siren was installed in 2015 to fill a ‘quiet spot’ identified by residents during testing in 2014. The testing will involve remote activation from our Blandford incident room, coastguard’s hut and individual sirens. Community engagement activities will take place on the Chiswell promenade near to the flood gate and the Cove Inn. Residents are invited to: Take a look around the Environment Agency’s new Incident Command Unit vehicle, which will be used as part of our on-site incident response (flooding and pollution). The unit is fitted with a satellite dish, CCTV camera and an external screen, which will allow live pictures and video to be transmitted back to incident rooms; Give feedback to officers on the sirens and new siren signage; Ask questions about flood risk, how the Chiswell Flood Protection scheme works and the agency’s flood warning service Floodline; and Sign up to the Floodline and make sure existing registrations are correct. The day supports the annual Environment Agency Flood Action Campaign. This year it runs from 1 to 11 November and is aimed at 18 to 34 year-olds - the age group least aware of flood risks."

/government/news/court-orders-almost-40000-to-be-repaid-to-mmo-after-fraudulent-claims,"Fraudulent funding claims were made to fisheries grant schemes Court orders almost £40,000 to be repaid to MMO after fraudulent claims Funding Marine Management Organisation Four defendants made inflated claims and submitted false invoices to the Marine Management Organisation (MMO) and its predecessor, the Marine Fisheries Agency (MFA), to obtain monies under two grant schemes, Portsmouth Crown Court heard today (3 September 2014). The offences related to three dishonest applications under the European Fisheries Fund (EFF) and the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance (FIFG). The schemes aimed to support a sustainable future for the UK fishing industry. The offences were picked up by the MMO during routine checks to tackle fraud. Michael Burge, 48, of Cosham Refrigeration Ltd. pleaded guilty to two counts of false accounting under the Theft Act for supplying false invoices, one to Ian Bickerstaff of West Quay Fisheries and one to William Brock of Brighton and Newhaven Fish Sales. He received a 10 month suspended sentence and was ordered to perform 120 hours of unpaid work. As a result of using the false invoice supplied to him, Brock, 49, received almost £30,000 that he was not entitled to, and kept the money. He pleaded guilty to an offence under the Fraud Act, and received a nine month suspended sentence and was ordered to perform 120 hours unpaid work. Both Ian Bickerstaff, 60, and David Henman, 65, of West Quay Fisheries, pleaded guilty to two counts of false accounting for supplying false invoices to the MMO and its predecessor agency, the MFA. Bickerstaff received a suspended sentence of eight months, and was ordered to perform 120 hours of unpaid work. Henman received a seven month suspended sentence and he will also be subject to a curfew order (8am-8pm) for two months. Brock was ordered to pay compensation of £28,782.34, and told the court he would pay the whole of the grant money given (£59,804.09 in total). Bickerstaff was ordered to pay £11,667.18. All four defendants were ordered to make a contribution to prosecutions costs, amounting to £46,612.80. Andy Newlands, Principal Marine Officer at the MMO, said: “We take any attempt to defraud grant schemes very seriously as this is taxpayers’ money. Any attempt to falsely claim funding is potentially depriving others of the opportunity to access these funds. “We appreciate that the vast majority of applications are made honestly but we can, and will, take action if false or inflated claims are made for grant funding. “We undertake thorough checks of grant applications to detect any discrepancies, as the grant schemes are hugely important to helping fishermen and related businesses continue to secure a sustainable future for our fishing industry.”"

North Shields fish quay restoration nominated for award Funding Marine Management Organisation Redevelopment of the fish quay at North Shields is one of four projects shortlisted for the Royal Town Planning Institute’s ( RTPI ’s) Planning Excellence Awards. Modernisation of the Western Quay at North Shields is one of the largest projects funded through the EFF in England, with the scheme contributing £2 million towards the £6 million development. Work included completely refurbishing the existing 125-year-old quay, which had been in a state of decline for 50 years. It was completed in October 2010 and created a berthing facility of 275 metres for up to 40 fishing boats and also provided easy access to services such as fuel and ice. These are of particular benefit to the large number of vessels visiting the port between September and March due to the lucrative prawn fishing grounds in the North Sea. The Western Quay project has also previously won an award from the Institute of Civil Engineers. The relocation of fish processing companies helping to bring the historic Clifford’s Fort moat back into view is another example of work funded in the area through the EFF scheme. The EFF is administered in England by the Marine Management Organisation and aims to help the fishing industry to become more sustainable and to remain profitable. The winner of the awards is announced on 10 October and more information about is on the RTPI ’s website."

Vessel owner and master guilty of illegal fishing in Lyme Bay Regulations, monitoring and enforcement Marine Management Organisation On 6 October Exeter Magistrates Court heard how in May 2013 the vessel Marina (BM190) was observed fishing for scallops in the Lyme Bay designated area by a UK Border Force vessel, HMC Valiant. Under the Lyme Bay Designated Area (Fishing Restrictions) Order, which came into effect in July 2008, dredging for shellfish and demersal trawling has been prohibited in a designated 60 square mile area of Lyme Bay. Evidence heard by the court included evidence from Natural England on the importance of this protected area. The Marina’s owner Stephen Hammond and master Daniel Hammond did not attend court on 6 October and had previously pleaded not guilty at an earlier hearing at Exeter Magistrates Court on the 27 May 2014. After finding them guilty the court ordered Stephen Hammond to pay a total of £5,620, including a fine of £3,000, costs of £2,500 and a victim surcharge of £120. Daniel Hammond was ordered to pay £6,620, including a fine of £4,000, costs of £2,500 and a £120 victim surcharge. Rachel Irish, Senior Marine Officer, for the Marine Management Organisation said: “Lyme Bay is an important marine habitat designated to protect rocky reef habitats and species from damage by activities such as bottom-towed gear fishing. “This case shows we are committed to protecting Lyme Bay, in particular by working with other authorities, such as the UK Border Force, to do so.” (Photo above by Alan Smith on Wikimedia Commons.

/government/news/exploring-options-for-fisheries-management-new-industry-panel-to-be-created,"The MMO is exploring a range of solutions for the fishing industry after the recent closures of key fisheries as a last resort measure. Exploring options for fisheries management – new industry panel to be created Regulations, monitoring and enforcement Marine Management Organisation Options include establishing a Have Your Say panel to get industry views on future fisheries management. This work is building on the quota surgeries already put in place, where the MMO regularly talks to fishermen at a local level to decide how regional fisheries will be managed. Further cuts in quota set at a European level are strongly expected in future years and this will only increase the chance of future closures, unless different ways of fisheries management are explored. As an example, UK quota for skates and rays in the North Sea has reduced by over 50 percent since 2006 and almost 80 percent since 2000. High levels of fishing in Spring/Summer 2014 has meant quotas are in even shorter supply toward the end of this year, especially after a harsh winter drove higher than normal activity in later months. The MMO has the difficult balancing act of maximising the quota available to fishermen while ensuring that quota limits are not exceeded, subjecting the UK to penalties that would impact next year’s quotas even further. Fisheries Minister George Eustice negotiates quotas for the UK at the annual European meeting in December. Prior to major reforms of the Common Fisheries Policy coming into force in 2015, the MMO has already been considering a range of solutions to help fishermen continue fishing throughout the year wherever possible. Andy Beattie, MMO Acting Chief Executive, said: “We want to have a frank conversation with the fishing industry, and will be consulting with them on a range of options that could be used to manage future quota. We are in the process of establishing a Have Your Say panel in January 2015 where fishermen will join Defra and the MMO to find solutions to quota management together. “We absolutely recognise that the traditional methods of quota management won’t be sufficient to cope with reductions in allocations at a European level, and need to be creative and collaborative to make it work.” The European Commission does allow some flexibility in rules for re-allocation of quota, so options will be drawn up for the industry to consider. As a starting point, we will be setting out the MMO’s decision making process for management of the English non-sector and 10m and under pool allocations of quota. This will include setting out more details for those stocks where closures have recently become necessary, such as: availability of quota for these pools of vessels in 2014 and how they developed during the year demands for fishing opportunities in the relevant fisheries trends in quota at UK and EU level risks managed by the MMO how the level of landings developed through the year background to catch limits put in place how quota uptake and licence variations are communicated to the industry. In addition, MMO is seeking industry views on helping the English fishing fleet to maximise its uptake of quota for cod in the eastern English Channel (VIId). We have published a consultation document which it sets out a number of questions and options including the in-year reallocation of quota within the English fishing fleet. The document also explains work to seek extra quota for the UK from other EU member states. Further details on the Have Your Say panel, and how to get involved, will be made available shortly."

/government/news/research-into-seal-deaths,"Evidence shows grey seals may be responsible for spiral seal injuries. Research into seal deaths  Marine Management Organisation Marine Scotland has published the results of research into the cause of unusual seal mortalities often referred to as spiral injuries. This research provides strong evidence that predation by grey seals rather than ship propellers is likely to be the main cause of death of seals found with spiral injuries around the UK coast. In 2010 the MMO worked with a number of organisations to look into the deaths of around 40 seals along the Norfolk coast which had distinctive spiral or corkscrew injuries. In particular it supported research by Marine Scotland and the Sea Mammal Research Unit ( SMRU ) following seal deaths in similar circumstances occurring more frequently in Scotland. Such injuries were also observed elsewhere in Europe. The MMO welcomes the new evidence that natural predatory behaviour is likely to be the main cause. This research does not completely eliminate ship propellers, but it is now less likely they are a key factor. Guidance will now be produced outlining the implications of the recent findings for regulators, statutory nature conservation bodies and developers working in and around the UK. A press release and the full report are available on the Scottish Government website. Further information about the findings can be obtained by contacting the researchers directly."

/government/consultations/consultation-into-conducting-a-scallop-demersal-effort-swap-with-the-netherlands-february-2015,"The Marine Management Organisation (MMO) has been asked to contribute to an effort swap with the Netherlands. Consultation into conducting a scallop-demersal effort swap with the Netherlands (February 2015)  Marine Management Organisation At the request of the UK-wide Scallop Industry Consultation Group, the Marine Management Organisation (MMO) has been asked to contribute to an effort swap with the Netherlands authorities to exchange Western Waters effort related to the 2015 effort year. The current proposal is to exchange 155,000 kW days of ICES area VII scallop effort (from the Netherlands) in return for 465,000 kW days demersal effort (from the UK). The decision on whether this exchange is agreed will be taken by UK Fisheries Administrations after a consultation and full analysis of the costs and benefits of the swap to all UK fishing fleets. As such, we are seeking the views of the scalloping sector and wider industry active in ICES area VII. Some relevant information is outlined below: At the current fleet size, the extra 155,000 KW days of effort would equate to 3.9 days of extra fishing activity per scalloping vessel affected (this is only over 15 metre scallopers that are currently subject to effort restrictions in Area VII). Currently these vessels are operating with a maximum of 36 days for the quarter. Landings by scallopers form a significant proportion of the throughput of many ports in the Channel, and the current levels of effort restriction on scallopers will be having an impact. The UK has a large amount of area VII demersal effort and as such no limitation of activity by UK demersal vessels will be seen if this swap is agreed. There are concerns over the increases seen in demersal effort in the Channel in recent years, which this swap would allow to continue. When the UK did not participate in this swap in 2014, the Netherlands acquired 300,000 kW days from Ireland (in exchange for 100,000 kW days scallop effort) in order for Dutch vessels to continue operating in the Channel. With these facts in mind we would like to know your views on the following questions: Should this swap take place? Please give reasons. Do you feel the proposed rate of 155,000 kW days scallop effort for 465,000 kW demersal effort is acceptable? If we agree to this swap, should the benefiting sector donate quota to compensate impacted fleet segments? The MMO are keen to consult with you on this subject and would welcome any comments by emailing effort@marinemanagement.org.uk by 20 March 2015."

The slipper limpet is a marine mollusc and is a non-native species in the UK. They can starve and smother native shellfish and compete for food and space with oysters. Damage to shellfish by slipper limpets can affect the ability of fishermen to sell their catch, particularly oysters mussels and scallops. See information on the slipper limpet on the GB Non-native Species Information Portal (GBNNSIP) The molluscs are already established in South England and South Wales although they are not currently prevalent in the North of England. The release of slipper limpets to the sea is an offence and must be avoided in order to protect shellfish beds that are currently free of this species. This includes the use of live or fresh slipper limpets as an angling bait, or disposal at sea, which may allow the escape of eggs and larvae into the marine environment. Sea users who find slipper limpets should report to the Marine Biological Association . Marine users who are aware of any use or disposal of slipper limpets should report the information to the MMO ."

Daniel Swallow, 25, of Seaview Avenue, West Mersea was charged with seven offences of failing to comply with the conditions of his fishing vessel licence which limited the quantity of skates and rays he was permitted to land in February, May, June, July, August, September and October of 2011. James Craig, 19, of Woodstock, West Mersea was charged with an offence of failing to comply with the conditions of his fishing vessel licence which limited the quantity of skates and rays he was permitted to land in April 2011. In order to maintain fish stocks, laws are set at European and national levels, and the Marine Management Organisation (MMO) in England enforces those laws. The defendants were charged in late 2011 and first appeared before the court in early 2012. The defendants raised legal arguments that the prosecutions were an abuse of process and should be stayed by the court as they alleged the way in which the UK fisheries administrations allocated fishing quota between the UK fleet was unlawful and contrary to EU law. The MMO opposed the defendants’ arguments and the Crown Court initially rejected them in March 2014. The defendants then exercised their right to appeal to the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) which was also opposed by the MMO. That appeal was heard in January 2015 and the court gave its judgement in February 2015 refusing the defendants’ appeal. The defendants, changed their pleas to guilty and were sentenced as follows: Terry Stimpson was fined £4,500 and ordered to pay a contribution to the costs of the prosecution of £1,500. Daniel Swallow was fined £3,150 and ordered to pay a contribution to the costs of the prosecution of £1,500. James Craig was fined £500 and ordered to pay a contribution to the costs of the prosecution of £2,000. The MMO is committed to protecting fish stocks and quota for law abiding fishermen who rely on these species to sustain their livelihoods. The majority of the fishing industry is compliant with the rules that govern its commercial activities, and the MMO takes proportionate compliance and enforcement action against those who are not compliant.

European grants applicant and supplier ordered to pay £17,925  Marine Management Organisation On 2 July 2015 Newcastle upon Tyne Crown Court heard that Trevor Bartlett, the Managing Director of Blue Sea Food Company of Paignton, Devon pleaded guilty to five offences of making a false or untrue application for a European Fisheries Fund (EFF) grant. Kevin Moore, a Director of Western Industrial Limited of Ashburton, Devon pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting Mr Bartlett to do so by supplying him with false documents on four separate occasions. Regulation 5(5) of the Grants for Fishing and Aquaculture Industries Regulations 2007 makes it an offence for a person to give information in an application for a grant which they know to be false or do not believe it to be true. The defendants offered guilty pleas to these offences as an alternative to charges brought under the Fraud Act 2006. On 5 January 2011 Trevor Bartlett made an application to the Marine Management Organisation (MMO) for funding under the EFF in the sum of £179,000. As part of the application he supplied three quotes which he certified as being independently sourced in accordance with the application process. In fact two of the quotes were false and had been created by Mr Bartlett. Kevin Moore’s firm was the preferred supplier in relation to this application and was given the contract. The grant in the sum of just over £169,000 was paid out after the work was completed prior to the MMO investigation revealing what had occurred. Trevor Bartlett also admitted that he had knowingly sent false documents as part of four further applications for grant funding between May 2012 and July 2013. The false documents were all in the form of supporting quotes which had been supplied to him by Kevin Moore, his preferred supplier. Kevin Moore admitted that on each of these four occasions he was Trevor Bartlett’s preferred supplier and he had agreed with Mr Bartlett to create and supply false supporting quotes to stand alongside his own quote for Mr Bartlett to send to the MMO. When questioned by MMO officers, Mr Moore accepted that normally he would expect an applicant to approach two other companies for independent quotes for such projects and he had never worked like this in 25 years. Only one of these four grant applications was processed and paid out in the sum of £75,287. The other three applications were suspended by the MMO pending the result of the investigation. It was accepted in Court by the MMO that there was no evidence in any of the applications that Mr Moore had inflated his quote or that the money paid out in funding to Mr Bartlett was not used on the projects for which the application for funding was made. On behalf of Trevor Bartlett the Court received several personal character references and was told of his various charitable works. Neither defendant had any previous convictions. In sentencing, his Honour Judge Bindloss accepted that the EFF grant process was based to a large extent on trust and that the two supporting quotes provide a measure of assurance to the MMO that the preferred supplier quote represents good value for public money. He said that the MMO could not be expected to check each quote submitted to ensure all quotes were genuine and was entitled to rely on the declaration made by an applicant on every application form that the information supplied was true. The Judge considered that in all the circumstances the level of harm caused by the defendants’ behaviour was relatively low but that their culpability was high as this was a deliberate deception by both of them designed to “cut through the system”. In addition the offences were repeated over a 2 year period. In Trevor Bartlett’s case he had declared on each of the five applications that the information submitted was true knowing it was not. The Judge felt that to an extent Mr Moore had been pressured into providing the false quotes. The Court gave the defendants maximum credit for their pleas. Trevor Bartlett was fined a total of £2,800 plus £8,750 in costs and Kevin Moore was fined £2,000 plus £4,375 costs. No order for compensation was made."
/guidance/get-a-fishing-vessel-licence-vessels-over-10-metres,"How to apply for a commercial fishing licence for vessels over 10 metres and mussel seed licences. Get a fishing vessel licence: over 10 metres and mussel seed Vessel licensing Marine Management Organisation 1. Overview You need a fishing vessel licence if you want to catch and sell sea fish, unless you’re exempt. If you fish without a licence or don’t comply with your licence conditions, you may be prosecuted. All owners are jointly liable for any offences committed by the vessel. There are 3 main licence types : Category A for stocks are those at greatest risk and have quotas Category B for stocks less at less risk than category A stocks, but still have quotas Category C for stocks not considered to be at immediate risk, and don’t generally have quotas To protect fish stocks no new licences are created and there are a limited number of licences in circulation. The only way you can get a licence is by transferring an existing one to your vessel. You need a licence entitlement to do this. When you’ve got the right entitlement for your vessel, you can convert it into a licence. Your vessel must be registered before you can get a licence. 2. Exemptions If any of the following points are true, you don’t need a licence. If your vessel is only used: to fish for common eels, salmon or migratory trout – you do need a rod licence within the 12 nautical mile limits around Jersey, Guernsey or the Isle of Man – you may need a licence from the suitable authority to fish for pleasure 3. Register your vessel You must register your vessel on the UK Ship Registry to get a fishing vessel licence, unless your vessel is registered in the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man. To get on the register: arrange an inspection by a Maritime and Coastguard Agency ( MCA ) inspector or surveyor fill in application form MSF4740 and send it to the address on the form You can choose simple or full registration. Full registration lets you take out a marine mortgage against your vessel. Registration fees Simple registration is £111 and full registration is £131. Documents you need If your vessel is between 10 and 15 metres overall length, you must include: Declaration of Eligibility (MSF 4728) original ownership documents – bill of sale, invoice or builder’s certificate Safety Certificate issued by MCA (MSF 1606) Seafish Construction Certificate if your vessel was built after July 2007 or a Seafish Inspection Report if your vessel was built before 2007 the vessel’s radio call sign, if you have one deletion certificate if the vessel was previously registered on another register a copy of the Certificate of Incorporation if the owner is a limited company If your vessel is over 15 metres, you must include all of the above (except the Seafish Inspection Report for vessels built before 2007) and: a UK fishing vessel certificate issued by MCA an ITC69 issued by a classification society recognised by the MCA Your evidence of ownership must cover the last 3 years if you’re applying for full registration. 4. Get a licence entitlement You can get an entitlement by buying: the entitlement from a vessel that has sunk, been scrapped or is no longer being used for fishing a vessel with a licence You need to make sure the entitlement is suitable for: a vessel over 10 metres the tonnage of your vessel and the size of the engine (kilowattage) You can combine 2 or more entitlements if 1 is not enough to cover your vessel. You can also split an entitlement if you don’t need it all. Register an entitlement bought without a vessel Fill in sections A and B of application form AFL7 and send it to your local Marine Management Organisation ( MMO ) office . MMO will check the previous owner has agreed to the transfer and return the form to you. Entitlements bought with a vessel The seller will transfer the entitlement into your name as part of the sale. MMO will send you form AFL7. Use form AFL7 to convert your entitlement into a licence. 5. Apply for your licence Fill in application form AFL2 to apply for a licence and send it to your local MMO office with your: certificate of registry for the vessel form AFL7 showing you as the entitlement holder Send the original documents, not copies. You may need to demonstrate an economic link between the vessel and the UK, Channel Islands or Isle of Man to make landings at certain ports within designated times. For more information please contact your local MMO office . Your vessel licence covers Western Europe – see www.ices.dk/marine-data/maps/Pages/default.aspx . If you want to fish in other, external waters you should contact your local MMO office . Renew your licence Your licence will be renewed automatically. You must apply for a mussel seed licence every year. 6.Mussel seed licences You will only qualify for a licence to collect mussel seed if you are registered as a shellfish farmer with either the MMO or the Welsh Government. Your application must be for a registered vessel designed to dredge seed mussel. How to apply for a mussel seed licence You have to apply using application form MUS1 to your local MMO office . MMO will get advice from the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science, Natural England and the local inshore fisheries and conservation authority ( IFCA ) to make sure the dredging is compatible with wider environmental considerations. You will only be able to collect mussel seed from the area and in the time period specified in the licence. You will not be permitted to fish for or take shellfish or sea fish for sale. This licence only authorises the holder to collect mussel seed for use in a registered agriculture production business and no other area. Your mussel seed licence will be invalid if you have, or get, a valid UK fishing vessel licence for the vessel. Mussel seed licence conditions The licence cannot be transferred and is only renewed if you apply. The licence doesn’t give any entitlement to any licence or authorisation under current or future licensing arrangements. The licence may be varied, suspended or withdrawn at any time. You must still get other permits or consents, if needed, like from the IFCAs. You must also comply with shellfish hygiene rules .

/guidance/how-to-trace-weigh-and-distribute-fish-products,"Fishery products must be traceable at all stages of production, processing and distribution, from catch or harvest to retail sale. How to trace, weigh and distribute fish products Regulations, monitoring and enforcement Marine Management Organisation Tracing fish products Fishery products may be put into ‘lots’ and adequately labelled or packed using a code, barcode, electronic chip or other similar method. A ‘lot’ is a quantity of fisheries and aquaculture products of a given species of the same presentation and coming from the same relevant geographical area and the same fishing vessel, or group of fishing vessels, or the same aquaculture production unit. After first-sale you can split or merge lots, but only if it is possible to trace them back to the catching or harvesting stage. The label and information must include the: identification number of each lot external identification number and name of the fishing vessel or the name of the aquaculture production unit FAO alpha-3 code of each species *date of catches or date of production quantities of each species in kilograms expressed in net weight or, where appropriate, the number of individuals name and address of the suppliers commercial designation, the scientific name, the relevant geographical area (see reference codes and the production method whether the fisheries products have been previously frozen or not Traceability checks will normally be carried out by food authorities, through trading standards officers or environmental health officers. Marine Management Organisation ( MMO ) enforcement officers may also check traceability information. Traceability is implemented through the Fish Labelling Regulations 2013 and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has provided guidance . Weighing fish products All fish must be weighed using an approved and certified weighing system on landing before they are sold or transported for sale or storage. Alternatively you may: weigh a specified sample of the catch in accordance with the UK sampling plan for weighing catches in port transport the catch to a registered auction in the UK where the catch may be weighed or sample weighed in accordance with the UK sampling plan transport the catch direct to a private buyer, merchant or agent in the UK where the catch must be fully weighed on receipt at the premises in accordance with the UK control plan transport the catch abroad to Belgium, France or Ireland in accordance with the UK’s common control programmes with these countries, providing that all fish is weighed at first marketing or storage Record weighing The figure resulting from the weighing must be used for completing landing declaration, transport document, sales note and take over declaration. A record of the weighing operation must be made and retained for 3 years indicating: the FAO alpha-3 code of the species weighed result of weighing for each quantity of each species in kilograms product weight the external identification number and the name of the fishing vessel from which the weighed quantity originates presentation of the fisheries products weighed date of weighing (YYYY-MM-DD) Transport fish The transporter must submit a copy of the transport document to the relevant UK fisheries authority within 48 hours of the fish being loaded. If the fish is transported outside the UK, an additional copy of the transport document must also be submitted to the authorities of the destination member state within 48 hours. The transport document must include the: the destination of the consignment(s) and the identification of the transport vehicle the external identification number and name of the fishing vessel that has landed the products the FAO alpha-3 code of each species and the relevant geographical area (see reference codes in which the catches were taken the quantities of each species transported in kilograms in product weight, broken down by type of product presentation or, where appropriate, the number of individuals the name(s) and address(es) of those receiving the fish products the place and date of loading The transporter does not have to carry a transport document if the information is submitted electronically before the transport begins. If the products have been weighed and a landing declaration has been completed, then this, or a document providing the same detail, can replace the transport document. If the fish has already been sold (as declared in a sales note) before the transport starts, the transporter must be able to provide documentary proof that a sales transaction has taken place.

/government/news/clarification-on-january-2015-catch-limits,"The Marine Management Organisation (MMO) has responded to questions about fisheries catch limits set for January 2015. Clarification on January 2015 catch limits Regulations, monitoring and enforcement Marine Management Organisation Catch limits apply to fish species subject to EU quotas and affect vessels under 10 metres and those not members of Fish Producer Organisations. In 2015 the MMO is setting these monthly for the majority of fish stocks, rather than quarterly as has happened in previous years. Catch limits for January 2015 are also based on the actual EU quota allocated to English under ten metre vessels, rather than including additional quota the MMO predicts it might bring in through swaps with other countries, as has happened in the past. Feedback the MMO has received is that industry wants fisheries to be open for the full year and our first priority is ensuring this. This inevitably involves compromising freeing up quota for fishermen when they need it and ensuring we do not reach EU quota limits before year end. When setting catch limits for a stock the MMO must also balance the needs of a large number of vessels who fish for them with different methods and at different times of the year. The MMO has explained its approach to certain stocks for 2015 directly with fisheries representatives who have contacted them. At their request it is looking to give the highest possible monthly catch limits during 2015, however these will not be to the levels of 2014. Vessels do have the ability to lease quota from producer organisations to increase the amount they can catch individually. Guidance is on the MMO website. The MMO is aware of the need to secure additional fishing opportunity through swaps and is working to do this as soon as possible. Skates and rays fishery in areas VI and VII (SRX/67AKXD) The catch limit for this fishery for January 2015 is 1.5 tonnes. The MMO recognises that the stock is of high importance in some areas and attracts good market prices in January. The limit is a compromise between this and the need to have fish available to other areas during the whole of 2015. (This fishery was closed in October 2014 as a last resort measure due to EU quota limits being reached.) The historic figures used by the MMO to guide its decisions show that there is not generally a high level of fishing activity for this skates and rays quota in January in the UK as a whole, despite previously high catch limits. In 2014 the catch limit for this fishery was 40 tonnes covering January and February, as it had been in 2013 and 2012. However, based on landings figures for skates and rays since 2012, very few vessels catch more than 1.5 tonnes in January. In 2012, which had the highest overall landings for skates and rays in the last 3 years, only 2 vessels exceeded this amount. A cautious approach to catch limits for the skates and rays fishery, and a small number of other stocks, has also been taken as the MMO is anticipating penalties from the EC in the form of quota reductions. This is due to limits being exceeded in 2014. The first job of the independent panel being established will be to review how the skates and rays fishery was managed in 2014 and look at how the MMO and industry can find the best possible way forward for all in the future."
/government/news/fisheries-closures-explained,"The MMO has provided an update about recent and anticipated closures of fisheries due to quota limits being exhausted.  Fisheries closures explained  Marine Management Organisation The MMO recognises the importance of its role in helping the fishing industry to make use of as much as possible of 2014 quotas. The early closure of fisheries is regrettable and we are aware of the impact these have and the frustration caused, particularly to those who have not exhausted their quota allocations. Where possible the MMO seeks to involve the industry and notify them in advance of our decisions, however there are occasions when it may need to take action and make closures at short notice. The early closure of fisheries is a last resort when all other efforts have been exhausted. If quota limits are exceeded they will have to be paid back next year and penalties may be applied by the European Commission, meaning the UK would have even less quota for 2015. The MMO generally expects several fisheries to be at over 70 percent of quota uptake at this stage of the year. It has identified around 10 fisheries with particularly high uptake and therefore likely to be at risk of reaching quota limits imminently. It has been warning industry groups of those fisheries at risk of closure and are also working with them, and on their behalf, to try and secure additional quota from international swaps. The success of swaps depends on factors like the uptake of these stocks in other EU member states. Plaice fishery in the English Channel (areas VIId and VIIe) The [ishery was closed to the English under 10 metre and non-sector quota pools from Sunday 26 October 2014 as both groups have fished more than their current allocated quota. Uptake on 27 October 2014 was over 115 percent for the English under 10s and 102 percent for the English non-sector. Up to 5 percent (around 75 tonnes) of the 2015 UK quota for this stock could be fished in 2014 under EC flexibility rules. However, the UK is estimated to have already fished over 100 percent of our quota, taking into account data that is yet to show on the monitoring systems. (The latest stock uptake at 27 October 2014 at UK level is 95 percent.) Therefore, the fishery is unlikely to re-open and a UK closure is imminent for this stock unless quota can be sourced internationally. The MMO is in discussion with Belgium, the Netherlands and France to request quota swaps as these member states also have a quota for this stock. Any possible deals may be limited however as they also have relatively high uptake. There has been a trend of quota reductions for this stock year-on-year. Quotas are set at an EU level and aim to increase stocks over the long-term. However, in the short to medium term this makes the role of the MMO more difficult in managing the quota to try to provide sufficient opportunities for fishermen to make a living. The quota for this stock is recommended to be cut by 14 percent in 2015 in the scientific advice published by ICES. This is based on the data limited method (Eastern English Channel or ICES area VIID) and the maximum sustainable yield approach (Western Channel or area VIIe.) Skates and rays fishery in the North Sea (SRX2AC4-C) The skates and rays fishery in the North Sea (areas IIa and IV) was [losed with effect from Sunday 26 October 2014 to English under 10 metre and non-sector vessels. This closure is due to the fact that both groups have fished more than their current allocated quota. There is no flexibility granted by the EU for the UK to use any of its 2015 quota for this fishery this year. The UK is estimated to be within one week of reaching 100 percent of our quota, taking into account data that is yet to show on the monitoring systems. The stock uptake at UK level was over 91 percent on 22 October 2014. Therefore, the under 10 metre and non-sector fisheries are unlikely to re-open and a UK closure is imminent for this stock unless quota can be sourced internationally. The MMO is in discussions with Belgium and Germany as these members may have a limited amount of quota of this stock to trade. However, any possible deals would be limited in tonnage and therefore have little impact on the overall UK uptake position. Other member states with quota have a high uptake and so will not be able to trade with us. UK quota for skates and rays in the North Sea has been significantly reduced - by over 50 percent since 2006 and almost 80 percent since 2000. This means that quota available to MMO is insufficient to meet the current needs of the inshore fleet for which this is an important species. Skates and rays fishery in areas VI and VII (SRX/67AKXD) The MMO closed this fishery on 12 October as landings information indicated that, after allowance is made for landings already made but not yet entered onto the MMO database, the UK quota for this stock has been exhausted. The closure is explained on the MMO website and in a [fishing vessel licence variation issued on 10 October 2014 The MMO is pursuing international swaps to source extra quota and have negotiated a number of these, 20 tonnes from Spain and 16 tonnes from Portugal, although this is not enough to re-open the fishery. Latest landing data shows that uptake has risen to 92 percent despite the quota brought in to the UK via the international swaps. The MMO is not yet able to say whether the fishery will be able to re-open in 2014. If it does not this year it will re-open on 1 January 2015. Other information Quotas are set annually at a European level by fisheries ministers. Defra takes part in these discussions on behalf of the UK. Quota use statistics are available on the MMO website and updated weekly. Statistics on fish landings are available on the MMO website. In 2013 UK vessels landed 2,600 tonnes of skates and rays into the UK, worth £3.2 million. 1.800 tonnes of these were in England, worth £2.4 million."

/guidance/manage-and-lease-fishing-quota,"How you can manage, allocate, swap, transfer or lease fishing quotas. Manage and lease fishing quota Regulations, monitoring and enforcement Marine Management Organisation Quota allocations MMO divides up England’s fishing quotas across the 3 fishing industry groups: sector – fish producer organisations that manage quota for their members 10-metres-and-under pool – vessels 10 metres or under that are not members of a producer organisation non-sector – vessels over 10 metres that are not members of a producer organisations The number of fixed quota allocation ( FQA ) units held by the individual vessels in each group, or by a group collectively, establishes what proportion of the EU quota is allocated to each group . The quota assigned to the non-sector and 10-metre-and-under pools may be adjusted in line with underpinning arrangements – this is where there are guaranteed minimum levels of allocated quota. The minimum level for each stock will be a percentage of the UK quota equal to the average percentage share of initial allocations made to the 10-metres-and-under fleet from 1991 to 1993. For vessels over 10 metres, FQA units are associated with the licence of the vessel. For vessels 10 metres and under, FQA units are held centrally by MMO . FQA units It is important that you are clear about your own FQA units and those associated with any licence or licence entitlement you buy. Statements of the FQA units associated with individual licences are issued to licence holders each year, usually in May. As the holder of a licence you can request details of the FQA units associated with your licence at any time from MMO . You can: transfer FQA units from a licence entitlement apply for a replacement FQA holding statement Read more about FQA units and get the application forms . Quota swaps Producer organisations can swap quota with other groups within the UK and MMO approves these swaps. The PO submits the Domestic Quota Swap Form to quotaswap.dqs@marinemanagement.org.uk . MMO negotiates quota swaps with other EU member states. Leasing extra quota You can apply to lease extra quota from a producer organisation ( PO ), to supplement your catch limits or to keep fishing a stock where the 10-metres-and-under or non-sector pool allocation has been used. If quota allocations have not been confirmed it is still possible to lease quota from a PO . Each PO should submit a leasing request to the MMO using the supplied letter template. !@1 You should follow the following steps once quota allocations have been issued. Step 1 Contact the MMO fisheries management team to find out if the extra quota you need can be made available by an increase in the catch limit for the stock in question. Telephone 0300 123 1032 or email quotaswap.dqs@marinemanagement.org.uk Step 2 If the MMO is unable to meet your requested catch limit increase, contact a PO directly to agree a lease. Step 3 The PO that you are leasing quota must complete a Domestic Quota Swap Form that includes your: vessel’s name Registry of Shipping and Seamen ( RSS ) number port letters and numbers ( PLN ) name and contact details amount of quota requested for lease The PO must submit the form to quotaswap.dqs@marinemanagement.org.uk . A group application must detail the proportion of the leased quota for each vessel. Step 4 MMO considers applications to lease quota on a case-by-case basis. MMO checks the licence and vessel details and considers the catch limits, amount of stock being leased and the overall UK uptake position for the stock. MMO take 10 days to process the application. Step 5 If the application is approved, MMO will send: an approved form back to the donor PO a permit letter confirming leased quota details to you naming the boat it applies to – the letter becomes part of your vessel’s fishing vessel licence a copy of the leasing letter to the vessel’s administration port See an [InlineAttachment:2]. Step 6 You can start fishing against the leased quota as soon as you receive the leasing letter. You must comply with the leasing scheme requirements. Scheme requirements You must be the owner of a vessel that is: 10-metres-or-under or non-sector fishing against the pool allocation for any stocks fishing in English waters in the current year Quota can be leased by individuals or a group: in year only for a minimum of 100kg in multiples of 100kg only for the purpose of fishing against the leased quota Unused leased quota will be carried forward into the next month and the licence holder will be permitted to fish the leased in quota, in addition to the monthly catch limit. This applies from the date of the letter until such time as: the additional leased-in quota is exhausted the fishery is closed at UK level the fishery is closed by the 31 December If you do not fish the quota by 31 December, the MMO may use unused quota to benefit the whole fishing industry including under 10 and non-sector pools or to swap with other countries. Unfished leased quota may be returned to the producer organisation from which it was leased (if the producer organisation agrees) up to the year end, but not beyond 31 December. You may not: fish against leased quota if the fishery is subject to a UK closure (all Fish Producer Organisations and non sector licences). transfer leased quota except by agreeing to return it to the PO it came from use leased quota to increase FQA units You must complete and submit full European Union logbooks and landing declarations within 48 hours of landing to your local MMO office for all stocks that you retain on board, discard and land. If you don’t, you may be prosecuted. Your catch is counted against the pool allocation first and your leased quota once the pool allocation is used. For example, if a monthly pool catch limit for a stock is 1 tonne and you lease in an extra 2 tonnes, your first tonne of a 2-tonne catch will be recorded against the pool and the second tonne against your leased quota. You must make sure your vessel does not exceed the total quota available to you. If you catch more than your limit, you may be prosecuted. How we manage fisheries quota European Union laws limit the amount of fish that may be landed each year – the total allowable catch ( TAC ) – to preserve fish stocks. Each member state, including the UK, receives an agreed share of the TAC as its quota. The UK quota is divided between England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. If the UK fishing fleet exceeds its quota, the quota may be reduced and there could be large fines. All UK vessels are subject to detailed quota management rules , which are updated each year. The Marine Management Organisation ( MMO ) is responsible for managing England’s fishing quotas and publishes specific English quota management rules for English vessels. MMO monitors landings of quota stocks and compares the amount caught and landed against total quota allocation.

/guidance/generating-energy-offshore,"Information about generating energy offshore  Generating energy offshore Marine licences Marine Management Organisation Offshore generating stations in English waters such as wind farms and wave and tidal devices will require consent before they can be built and before they can generate energy. Stations which would generate more than 100 megawatts ( MW ) are classed as nationally significant infrastructure projects and require a development consent order granted by the Secretary of State. This may supersede the need for the other consents outlined below. Marine licences The construction of works, deposit of substances or articles, dredging and many other activities require a marine licence from Marine Management Organisation ( MMO ). Often offshore generating stations will include licensable activities. You can find more information about how to apply , the activities which require a licence and apply for a licence online. Electricity Act 1989 consents You will need consent from MMO to construct, extend or operate any offshore generating stations with a generating capacity of between 1 and 100MW – section 36 You can also apply to remove the public rights of navigation that pass through the generating station, a section 36A declaration. If applying for a section 36A declaration this must be done at the same time as your application for section 36 consent. Application fees vary depending on the generating capacity of the installation. If you need both consents you must apply for both at the same time. Further guidance on section 36 variations Some electricity generating works may be subject to regulation under the Electricity Works (Environmental Impact Assessment) (England and Wales) Regulations 2000 (as amended) and require an environmental impact assessment to be submitted to the MMO alongside the main application. Safety zone applications You can apply to MMO for a safety zone declaration around offshore renewable energy generating stations. Safety zone applications can be made at the same time as the section 36 consent, or independently. You should declare whether you intend to apply for a safety zone declaration when you apply for section 36 consent. Safety zone declarations can have different phases to cover construction, operation and decommissioning, but they do not cover cables (either inter-array or export cables). The usual zone is 500 metres for construction and 50 metres for the operational phase. Further guidance on safety zone consents Application fees for safety zone consents."

/government/news/company-secretary-fined-4046-for-fisheries-offences,"RDS Northwest fined £4,046 by Working Magistrates for purchasing fish without an electronic sales note Company secretary fined £4,046 for fisheries offences  Marine Management Organisation On 6 October 2015 Workington Magistrates’ Court sentenced Mr Richard Donnan (Senior) in a prosecution brought by the MMO. The court heard that between 7 February 2014 and 13 April 2014 RDS Northwest Limited (a registered buyer of first sale fish) had purchased fish on fourteen separate occasions from three vessels. In addition Mr Donnan, through neglect, had failed to submit electronic sales notes to the MMO within the 24 hour period required by EU regulations. The value of the fish in question was shown to be around £51,000. The court heard that the company had been dissolved since the offences, but the prosecution was brought against Mr Donnan in his capacity as company secretary. Mr Donnan entered a guilty plea to the charge and after hearing mitigation on his behalf the court ordered him to pay a fine of £2,000, the costs of bringing the prosecution of £1926 and a victim surcharge of £120.00. Persons intending to purchase any fish direct from a licensed commercial fishing vessel or from the vessel’s agent or other such person must be registered with the MMO and must comply with EU obligations to submit sales notes within 48 hours or, if the business turnover is greater than EUR 200,000 per year, submit sales notes electronically within 24 hours."
/government/news/fishing-activity-in-the-baie-de-seine,"The Marine Management Organisation (MMO) has been made aware of fishing activity in the Baie de Seine, which is in French waters. Fishing activity in the Baie de Seine  Marine Management Organisation The scallop fishery for the area is the subject of an agreement between the United Kingdom and France. The MMO has received correspondence from the UK fishing industry concerning the current restriction on UK vessels in excess of 15 metres fishing for scallops in this area which is in place until 1 November 2015. The MMO is working with colleagues in Defra and the relevant fisheries administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland in order to establish a consensus as to whether the UK wishes to vary this restriction and will provide an update in due course. In the meantime, the prohibition on vessels in excess of 15 metres fishing for scallops in the Baie de Seine agreement area is a UK fishing licence condition and remains in place. The MMO would point out that any vessel subject to the condition which goes into the area to fish for scallops may be in breach of its licence and may be subject of investigation and possible enforcement action. If you are affected by the closure and wish the MMO to consider your views, we would encourage you to contact the MMO at effort@marinemanagement.org.uk"

/government/news/26-tonnes-of-undulate-ray-quota-opened-to-english-vessels,"The MMO has set the maximum catch limit possible under European regulations for undulate rays to help hard working fishermen. 26 tonnes of undulate ray quota opened to English vessels  Marine Management Organisation Undulate rays caught in area VIIe are now classed as an acceptable by-catch which can be retained up to a maximum of 20kgs live weight per trip, bringing more flexibility for fishermen in the English fleet. Martyn Youell MMO Head of Fisheries Management said: “In our regular discussions with the fishing industry, the discarding of undulate rays has been highlighted as an issue in certain local areas. We therefore worked hard with Defra to secure and implement a sustainable level of commercial quota for fishermen.” The breeding season for undulate ray is Spring/Summer and so this is an ideal time to open the quota. A further 2 tonnes of undulate ray in area VIId is being retained for scientific research to better understand the stock distribution."

/government/news/mmo-and-fco-host-joint-iuu-workshop-with-the-uk-insurance-industry,"The MMO is pleased to be jointly hosting a workshop with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) on 20 November 2015. MMO and FCO host joint IUU workshop with the UK insurance industry  Marine Management Organisation The workshop is aimed at working with the UK insurance industry towards adherence with the Illegal Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing regulations. Under IUU regulations it is an offence to conduct business directly with any IUU vessel; this includes providing insurance to such vessels. As part of the MMO’s approach to proportional risk-based enforcement, the workshop is an opportunity to educate and inform the insurance industry in respect of the IUU regulations. Rachel Mason, MMO Senior Marine Enforcement Officer said: “We have been investigating suspected breaches of IUU regulations on an international scale for some time now, working with other regulatory bodies around the world including Interpol and of course the FCO. When illegal activity is identified our aim is to stop it and prevent it reoccurring. This can be via prosecution or formal sanctions, but it can also be via a workshop such as this one where we speak to an industry that is very keen to work with us to ensure adherence to IUU regulations”."
/government/publications/undulate-ray-commercial-bycatch,"The European Commission granted the UK and other member states specific quotas for undulate ray in 2015. Undulate Ray commercial bycatch  Marine Management Organisation Key Points Undulate ray caught in area VIIe is open to be landed as a by-catch by any English (including Jersey and Guernsey) administered commercial fishing vessel up to a maximum of 20kgs live weight per trip. MMO is considering opening a by-catch in area VIId in 2016 but this will remain closed from 1 January 2016 until further notice Background In recent years prior to 2015 no undulate rays have been allowed to be landed. Since 2015 the UK quotas have been set for two ICES areas at bycatch levels of 26 tonnes in area VIIe and 2 tonnes in area VIId. The MMO carried out a consultation in 2015 to provide an opportunity to inform how the quotas are managed. Five responses were received and the content of these has been considered in deciding to keep the fishery at a bycatch level of 20kgs per vessel per trip. This is the maximum permitted by the European regulation. In the UK the following applies: Retention of no more than 20kg live weight per trip caught in ICES area VIIe only. Catches to be reported separately under code RJU. Provision of detailed geo-referenced catch and effort data, i.e. catch parameters (landings and discards) and gear characteristics (soak time or tow duration as appropriate) A joint statement between the UK and other EU member states places the following conditions on the landing of undulate rays: Minimum landing length of 78 cm, maximum landing length of 97 cm. Three-month ban on landing undulate ray during their breeding season. Development of a code of good practice in cooperation with stakeholders. No transhipment at sea of specimens. Landing only whole or gutted specimens. All the regulation and joint statement conditions must be followed by fishermen wishing to land undulate rays. It is unusual to have a maximum landing size. This is designed to help protect more females of high reproductive capacity and so the stock size. Mature females tend to be larger than mature males. A code of conduct for handling undulate rays has been produced by Defra. This should be followed by fishermen to the greatest degree possible. The breeding season is assumed to be during the spring / summer so landings will not be permitted from the start of May to the end of August."
/government/publications/manage-your-fishing-effort-sole-recovery-zone,"Detailed scheme rules and application forms to fish in the Sole Recovery Zone with regulated gears. Manage your fishing effort: Sole Recovery Zone 2016/2017  Marine Management Organisation 1. Overview 1.1 The following rules apply to the carriage and use of regulated gears in the Sole Recovery Zone ( SRZ ) for the 2016 to 2017 Management Year (which runs from 1 February 2016 to 31 January 2017), The SRZ Scheme applies to vessels of 10 meters and over in length. The rules apply in the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea ( ICES ) Area VIIe (Western Channel). 1.2 Compliance with the rules is a condition of your fishing vessel licence. Failure to comply with these rules or any condition of your fishing vessel licence is likely to be investigated and may result in action being taken in line with the Marine Management Organisation’s ( MMO ) Compliance and Enforcement Strategy, including (where appropriate) prosecution. 1.3 These rules may be updated or amended during the 2016 to 2017 Management Year, and it is recommended that you check these rules on a regular basis. In addition, you should also be familiar with the relevant EU and UK national legislation governing the carriage and use of regulated gears in the SRZ . 2. Is my vessel eligible to carry and use regulated gears in the SRZ ? 2.1 A vessel will be eligible to carry and use regulated gears in the Sole Recovery Zone where: the vessel has a record of fishing activity with regulated gear in the years 2002 to 2014 vessel eligibility has been obtained via the transfer of a single licence (or the aggregation of two or more licences) where the originating vessel(s) has such a record of fishing activity 2.2 Eligible vessels may apply to the MMO for an allocation of effort days in order to undertake fishing activity within the SRZ using regulated gear (but see the exemption in paragraph 5). 2.3 In addition, a person who holds a licence entitlement which is administered by the MMO and which would be eligible under one of the two criteria above to carry and use regulated gears in the SRZ if it was an active licence, may apply for an allocation of effort days. 3. Transferring eligibility to carry and use regulated gears 3.1 Where a vessel owner wishes to transfer eligibility to the licence before a change of ownership of the vessel, the licence or both, they must notify their local MMO coastal office and provide written evidence confirming that this has been agreed by both parties. 3.2 In cases where a vessel with eligibility is sold without its licence and the MMO has not been notified of any transfer of eligibility or documentary evidence has not been provided, it will be assumed that eligibility remains with the purchased vessel. 3.3 Where eligibility is obtained via the transfer and combination of two or more licences, each licence must hold eligibility to carry or use regulated gears within the SRZ . 3.4 Where an eligible licence is divided into parts, all parts carry the eligibility of the original licence, except where the part does not carry with it engine power. 4. Which gears are regulated? 4.1 Paragraph 2 of Annex IIC of Council Regulation (EU) 2015/104 sets out a list of the regulated gears as follows: Beam trawls with a mesh size equal to or larger than 80mm static nets (including gill nets, trammel nets and tangle-nets) with a mesh size smaller than 220mm 5. Exemption for certain vessels catching less than 300kg of Dover Sole 5.1 A vessel which would otherwise be required to comply with these SRZ rules is exempt if: it has a track record between 2011 and 2014 of catching less than 300kg (live weight) of Dover Sole per management year it uses static nets (including gill nets, trammel nets and tangle-nets) with a mesh size equal to or larger than 120mm within the SRZ it catches less than 300kg (live weight) of Dover Sole during the 2016/17 management year; and it does not tranship any fish at sea to another vessel 5.2 Any vessel which is exempt under paragraph 5.1 does not require a basic allocation of effort days in order to carry and use regulated gear within the SRZ in accordance with the exemption. 5.3 However, where any of the conditions in paragraph 5.1 are not met, the vessel concerned ceases to be exempt from the SRZ rules with immediate effect. 6. How do I apply for an allocation of effort days? 6.1 Effort days are allocated for use within a management period. An application for an allocation of effort days may therefore be made either: for a management period covering the entire 2016 to 2017 management year for a management period of one month or more within the 2016 to 2017 management year 6.2 In order to apply for an allocation of effort days, the master or owner or an eligible vessel (or their representative) must submit an application form to their local MMO coastal office before: the 9 January 2016 where the intended management period is for the entire 2016 to 2017 management year the start of the management period for which they are applying for shorter management periods 6.3 Please note: the MMO will not accept applications for allocations made after the 9 January 2016 (for an intended management period covering the entire 2016 to 2017 management year), or after the start of an intended shorter management period. In no circumstances will an allocation of effort days be back-dated to cover the carriage and use of regulated gear prior to the allocation. 6.4 The completed application form must include details of all of the regulated gear(s) which are intended to be carried and used. 6.5 Upon an application for an allocation for effort days being successful, the MMO will issue an authorisation letter. The authorisation letter must be carried at all times by the master of the vessel when carrying or using regulated gears in the SRZ . 7. What is the ‘Basic Allocation’ of effort days? 7.1 The table below sets out the Basic Allocation of effort days by gear type for the 2016 to 2017 management year (as taken from paragraph 5 of Annex IIC of Council Regulation (EU) 2015/104): Gear type Basic Allocation of effort days Beam trawls with a mesh size equal to or larger than 80mm 207 Static nets with a mess size equal to or smaller than 220mm 164 7.2 The above Basic Allocations may be altered by one or more of the following factors: 7.3 Allocation for management periods shorter than the full management year 7.3.1 Where an application for an allocation of effort days relates to a management period which is less than the full 2016 to 2017 management year, the basic allocation of effort days will be a proportion of the above figures (rounded down to the nearest full day). 7.3.2 For example, if an application is for use of a beam trawl with a mesh size equal to or larger than 80mm within a management period of 3 months, then the basic allocation will be 52 days (207 days divided by 12 times by 3 and rounded down to the nearest full day). 7.4 Allocation for more than one type of regulated gear 7.4.1 Where an application for an allocation of effort days relates to both types of regulated gear, the allocation will be 186 days of which 164 days can be used fishing with static nets (which is an average of the basic allocations of both regulated gear types, rounded down to the nearest full day). 8. What are my obligations under the Sole Recovery Zone rules? 8.1 In addition to ensuring that all relevant legislation and fishing vessel licence conditions are complied with, there are other obligations under these rules which you must comply with. 8.2 Time recording and calculating effort days used 8.2.1 Time spent utilising SRZ effort days must be accurately recorded. In these rules a ‘day’ is a continuous period of time up to 24 hours spent within the SRZ carrying or using regulated gear. A continuous period of time is calculated: from the point at which the vessel either enters the SRZ ; or where the vessel is within a port which is located within the SRZ , the vessel leaves that port; by counting all of the time spent by the vessel within the SRZ while carrying or using the regulated gear, to the point the vessel leaves the SRZ or enters a port which is located within the SRZ . 8.2.3 Any time spent: coming to the aid of another vessel which requires emergency assistance transporting an injured person for emergency medical aid and which would otherwise be counted as part of a continuous time period in accordance with paragraph 8.2.1, is not counted for that purpose. You must notify your local MMO office of any time spent for either of these purposes as soon as possible after the event. 8.3 Prohibition on using Beam Trawls trans-zonally during the same fishing trip 8.3.1 During the same fishing trip a vessel must not use Beam trawls with a mesh size equal to or larger than 80mm both within the Relevant Area (defined in 8.3.3 below) and within either ICES Area VIId or VIIh. 8.3.2 A vessel which has used Beam trawls with a mesh size equal to or larger than 80mm within the Relevant Area must return to port and land any catch before using such Beam trawls within either ICES Area VIId or VIIh. 8.3.3 The ‘Relevant Area’ is that part of the SRZ to the east of the 5 degrees West line of longitude. 8.4 Other Obligations 8.4.1 Only one type of regulated gear may be carried on board a vessel at any time, unless an exemption has been issued by the MMO . 8.4.2 Upon notification by the MMO , the master or licence holder must permit an observer to be on board the vessel during a fishing trip within the SRZ . 9. Transferring effort days between vessels 9.1 It is permissible during the management period for effort days from the basic allocation to be transferred: Between vessels which have both received basic allocations of effort days during the management period; From a vessel which has received a basic allocation of effort days to a vessel which has not previously applied for a basic allocation (and which following transfer will be able to use regulated gear in the SRZ ); or From a person who has received a basic allocation of effort days by virtue of an eligible licence entitlement (see paragraph 2.3). 9.2 There are limitations on transferring effort days:- there is a limit to the amount of efforts days which can be transferred out from a vessel during the management period (this limit is an average of what the donating vessel used and transferred out between 2001 and 2005. Records of these transfer limits can be provided by MMO ) effort days may only be transferred where both vessels (or the licence entitlement and the vessel) are administered by the MMO effort days which are transferred to a vessel may not subsequently be transferred from that vessel to another vessel effort days may not be transferred to a vessel in order to cover any previous use of regulated gears within the SRZ not covered by effort days held in respect of the vessel effort days may not be transferred to a person holding a licence entitlement 9.3 In order to transfer effort days, an application must be submitted to the MMO from the owner/master of the vessel to which the effort days are to be transferred. Following approval of the application for the transfer of effort days, written confirmation of the transfer will be provided by the MMO . Until the written confirmation is received, the additional effort days cannot be used by the receiving vessel. 9.4 Where a transfer takes place, the number of effort days received will be adjusted in proportion to the comparative fishing capacity (measured in engine power) of the vessels involved. 10. What happens once I have used all of my allocation of effort days? 10.1. When a vessel has exhausted its allocation of effort days, the vessel must cease using the regulated gears within the SRZ immediately and return to port. Further use of the regulated gears within the SRZ during the rest of the management period may only occur following a completed transfer of additional effort days to the vessel (see paragraph 9.3). 11. Further Information 11.1 If you have any queries in relation to any aspect of these rules please contact the MMO ’s Effort Management Team on the following contact details:- Telephone number: 0191 3762596 Email effort@marinemanagement.org.uk"

/government/consultations/consultation-on-the-distribution-of-fixed-quota-allocation-fqa-units,"UK fishing quotas are distributed on the basis of the holdings of Fixed Quota Allocation units (FQAs) on fishing vessel licences.  Consultation on the distribution of fixed quota allocation (FQA) units  Marine Management Organisation The FQA units are used in the allocation of quota in a way similar to a share system. The mix of FQAs held by vessels in membership of each fishing group at 1 January each year is used to determine the share of the UK quota each group receives. A fishing group can be a Producer Organisation (PO) or a pool of vessels managed by a UK Fisheries Administration. The UK Quota Management Rules set out the shared policy of the UK Fisheries Administrations (FAs) that, “Where new quotas are allocated to the UK, the FAs will generally seek to establish appropriate FQA units, following consultation with representatives of the fishing industry and any other interested parties.” For fish stocks that have come into existence after the 1994 -1996 reference period, decisions on the distribution of FQAs have been made by UK FAs in consultation with stakeholders. This document seeks your views on options for establishing FQAs for stocks currently allocated by temporary allocation methods. This consultation invites your views on the method to establish the new FQA units by asking five specific questions.

/government/news/fine-of-1746950-for-fisheries-offences-in-case-brought-by-mmo,"On 19 February 2016 Ocean Rover Limited appeared at North Tyneside Magistrates Court in a case brought by the MMO. Fine of £17,469.50 for fisheries offences in case brought by MMO  Marine Management Organisation Ocean Rover Limited were represented by the company director, Mr Kenneth Liddell and Mr Gerry Lafferty - the owner and master of the Ocean Rover (SN2) fishing vessel. Vessel master, Gerry Lafferty, pleaded not guilty to the offences and will next appear in Crown Court on 18 March 2016. Vessel owner Kenneth Liddell pleaded guilty to five offences and was ordered to pay a total financial penalty of £17,469.50 including a contribution towards the costs of the prosecution. The court heard how the vessel was accused of quota offences for whiting, plaice and nephrops species together with two incursions into closed fishing areas. The vessel, a member of the 10 metre and over non-sector, was subject to limits on the quantity of certain species it was allowed to retain on board and land. The court was told that in January 2015 the vessel landed 510 kg of whiting in excess of the monthly limit, in May 2015 the vessel landed 10,214 kg of plaice in excess of the monthly limit and in the quarter ending September 2015 the vessel landed 7,272 kg of nephrops. The total first sale value of the fish landed in excess of quota limits was £23,274.00 Additionally, the court heard that on two occasions in August 2015 the vessel was reported to be in a real time closure area, MMO 587, at speeds consistent with fishing activities, contrary to a condition in its fishing vessel licence. Real time closure areas have been agreed by the UK with the EU as a conservation method in return for an additional allocation of fishing effort in the cod recovery zone. The company highlighted to the court in mitigation that it had entered the fishing industry as an investment opportunity had limited knowledge of the rules and regulations of the fishing industry and was , therefore, reliant on its employees who operated the vessel on a day to day basis. The court was also told that, as a result of these offences, six points per offence will be applied to the vessel’s fishing vessel licence in accordance with the provisions of the EU control regulation (EC) 1224/2009 and in accordance with the MMO’s guidance on the operation of the points system. Owing to the accumulation of 30 points, the vessel’s licence is to be suspended for two months. The case against the master is ongoing. A spokesman for the MMO said: “This prosecution has been brought by the MMO to ensure the activities of law abiding fishermen who comply with quota restrictions and closed areas are not undermined by those who do not abide by them. In this case fisheries patrols and Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) data were combined to detect and provide evidence to the court of these offences. Fisheries offences of this nature do not allow for a level playing field amongst operators. The MMO recognises that the majority of fishing vessel operators comply with the relevant regulations, but where infringements are detected will apply its compliance and enforcement strategy proportionately and will reserve use prosecution as a last resort, reserved for the most serious offences.”"

Clean an oil spill at sea and get oil spill treatments approved Oil spills Marine Emergencies: preparation, response and recovery Marine Management Organisation Oil spills at sea You have 2 main options when dealing with an oil spill at sea. Do nothing You can let natural processes disperse, evaporate and degrade the spill for you – this is probably the best option when: the quantities of oil are small the oil is a type that tends to disperse or evaporate readily without intervention no marine resources are threatened by the spill Use an oil spill treatment product You can intervene if an oil spill represents a safety risk, or poses a significant threat to commercial, environmental or amenity interests. You must consider the effects of any intervention. Some techniques are poorly-suited to marine conditions around the coast of UK. Unless the oil can be physically recovered, the choice is often between leaving the oil alone or using an oil spill treatment product. Request approval to use an oil spill treatment product You need approval from the Marine Management Organisation ( MMO ) before you use a product to treat oil if: the water is fewer than 20 metres deep or is within 1 nautical mile of such depths you want to use it under the surface of the sea MMO will respond within 1 hour approving or rejecting your request to use an approved product in English or Welsh waters. The product must be approved by MMO and be used in line with the conditions of its approval. Read MMO ’s [InlineAttachment:1]. Report a marine pollution incident In a marine pollution incident MMO consults several organisations to ensure that specific scientific, environmental and fisheries advice is taken into account for every decision. To report a marine pollution incident call: 0300 200 2024 within office hours 07770 977 825 outside office hours 0345 051 8486 or 0845 051 8486 at all times if other numbers out of order *Please note this number will no longer be in use from December 2014 You can use approved oil spill treatment products where there is a genuine risk to human life or to the safety of an installation or vessel without consulting with MMO . MMO and the relevant statutory nature conservation agencies – Natural England, Natural Resources Wales, Scottish Natural Heritage, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee – should be informed after the incident. MMO approves use in English and Welsh waters. Marine Scotland and Northern Ireland Environment Agency approve use in their waters. MMO acts on behalf of the UK for testing and approving oil treatment products intended for use in UK waters. Standing approvals A standing approval is an agreement between MMO and a port or harbour authority, that specific oil spill treatment products may be used under certain conditions and in specific areas, without approval. This means a faster response to oil spills. Standing approvals may also be given to operators of oil and gas installations in coastal waters, or fixed locations such as terminals. Port or harbour authorities must report to MMO that they have used a standing approval at the earliest possible opportunity. Standing approvals for England and Wales exist at the locations below. You can view the extent of each standing approval on the Coastal and Marine Resource Atlas interactive map, by selecting the standing approvals layer on the list of layers.

/guidance/how-we-respond-to-marine-pollution-incidents,"How to report marine pollution incidents, the response to an incident and how to get approval to use an oil spill treatment product. How we respond to marine pollution incidents Oil spills Marine Marine Management Organisation Introduction Oil and other pollutants which are occasionally spilt into the sea can endanger environmental resources and property, as well as putting human life at risk. Where environmental resources, human health or property are at risk, a range of products and equipment are available to minimise the impact of the oil. As a global leader in responding to marine pollution, however, the UK has well-tested systems in place to deal with incidents. The turbulent nature of UK waters means it is rarely possible to recover the spilled oil. However, treatment products work with the wave action by mixing the product with the oil and encouraging it to disperse. Incidents Maritime Rescue Co-ordination Centres act as co-ordinators during incidents and circulate all pollution or situation reports to the Marine Management Organisation ( MMO ) for English and Welsh waters. Marine Scotland and the Northern Ireland Environment Agency are responsible for their waters. Copies are also sent to national and regional statutory nature conservation agencies, and local councils that may be affected by the oil spill. In the event of a major spill, these organisations set-up an environment group to give advice on the suitable response to changing circumstances. MMO aims to approve or refuse oil spill treatment product use within 1 hour of being asked to authorise dispersant use. MMO can also give advice on the type of product most suitable for dealing with a particular incident. MMO aims to ensure that damage caused by the oil or oil spill treatment product is minimised. MMO consults on the implications for fisheries and marine fauna and flora with: Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science ( Cefas ) Food Standards Agency ( FSA ) Natural England Natural Resources Wales Scottish Natural Heritage Joint Nature Conservation Committee In the case of major spills, any spraying of dispersants is normally supervised by the Marine and Coastguard Agency ( MCA ). MMO and statutory nature conservation agencies will be closely involved when there are important environmental or fisheries concerns. With less serious spills it is up to those dealing with the incident to make direct contact with MMO before any oil spill treatment products are used. In coastal waters, including areas within harbour limits, formal approval will usually be required . Report and respond to a marine pollution incident To report a spillage call your local coastguard . To request approval to use an oil spill treatment product call the MMO Marine Pollution incidents line on 0300 2002024. Out of office hours please call 07770 977 825. At all times or if other numbers out of order, please call 0345 051 8486 or 0845 051 8486. MMO consults other organisations during an incident to make sure specific scientific, environmental and fisheries advice is used for every decision to use oil spill treatment products. MCA should be informed immediately of any oil spill in marine waters through the nearest coastguard station . MCA developed the National Contingency Plan for dealing with incidents, and to combine local plans into this national response. Call MMO to request approval to use an oil spill treatment product or report a marine pollution incident on: 0300 2002024 during office 07770 977 825 outside of office hours 0345 051 8486 at all times if other numbers out of order 02920 491719 for incidents in Wales MMO has a specific Marine Pollution Contingency Plan that describes MMO ’s role in incidents. Ports and harbours in England and Wales are required to have contingency plans ready to be put in place in the event of a marine pollution incident emergency. Oil spill treatment products If you want to use an oil spill treatment product, you will need to get approval from the Marine Management Organisation ( MMO ). For more information, see the section in this guide on MMO approval to use oil spill treatment products. Use in the sea in any area with a depth of less than 20 metres, or within 1 mile of any such area also requires specific permission. The only exception being if permission is preapproved in a contingency plan. Find information on contingency planning on the MMO website. Treatment products include: dispersants - chemicals which, when applied to oil floating on the surface of the sea, greatly increase the rate of dispersal and therefore breakdown of the oil surface cleaners - chemicals which, when applied to oil-covered hard surfaces, increase the rate of dispersal from the surface, aiding cleaning bioremediation products - these contain, or enhance the growth of, oil-degrading bacteria loose sorbents - usually in the form of powder, granules or beads which absorb oil degreasers - products used for cleaning grease from machinery of ships and marine structures Equipment that may be used to control, contain or recover oil without approval or permission includes: booms - barriers that sit on the surface of the water and block the movement of floating pollution, protecting certain areas, and making mechanical recovery of pollutants such as oil much more effective. Booms work best in calm conditions where oil and water do not splash over or move under the boom. skimmers - machines that separate liquids or matter from the surface of a water body. sorbent mats or pads - bags containing absorbent products, usually in the form of granules or beads, which are porous and allow water and pollution in without allowing the product to escape. For advice on marine pollution, contact the MMO Marine Pollution Response Team on 0191 376 2511 or email them at dispersants@marinemanagement.org.uk . Rapid MMO approval to use oil spill treatment products If a request to use an oil spill treatment product is made within English or Welsh waters, the MMO will give a formal response within one hour. To ensure a rapid response, they have trained responders available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Other organisations that are consulted in marine pollution incidents include: MMO offices - these provide information on marine and fishery activities in the local area Cefas - advise on the likely impact of the pollution Natural England or Countryside Council for Wales - these provide advice on whether the local area is environmentally protected or sensitive (in cases where the pollution is within 12 nautical miles of land) the Joint Nature Conservation Committee - this advises on whether the local area is environmentally protected or sensitive (in cases where the pollution is more than 12 nautical miles of land) FSA - this advises on nearby fisheries that may be affected, and can take action to prevent contamination For non-urgent queries you can contact the Marine Pollution Response Team by writing to the following address: Marine Pollution Response Team Lancaster House Hampshire Court Newcastle upon Tyne NE4 7YH Environmental response to marine pollution incidents It is important to ensure that marine pollution salvage and clean-up operations do not cause unnecessary damage to the environment. Where private property is affected by marine pollution, it is important to remember that only approved products may be used for cleaning, and then only with the MMO ’s permission. The Green Blue has more information on cleaning boats. Secretary of States’ Representative ( SOSREP ) The role of the SOSREP is to represent the Secretaries of State for the Department for Transport (in relation to ships) and for the Department of Energy and Climate Change (in relations to offshore installations) by removing or reducing the risk to safety, property and the UK environment arising from accidents involving ships, fixed or floating platforms or sub-sea infrastructure. SOSREP ’s powers extend to UK territorial waters (12 nautical miles from the coast/baseline) for safety issues and to the UK Pollution Control Zone (200 miles or the median line with neighbouring states) for pollution. SOSREP is empowered to make crucial and often time-critical decisions, without delay and without recourse to higher authority, where such decisions are in the overriding UK public interest. Working closely with the MCA , its parent organisation the Department for Transport (DfT) and the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC), SOSREP ’s key responsibilities include: acting at the earliest point during a shipping or offshore incident to assess the risk to safety, to prompt the end of any such incident and to ensure that increasing risk is evaluated and appropriate measures taken to prevent or respond to escalation; monitoring all response measures to significant incidents involving shipping and the offshore industry; if necessary, exercising control by implementing the powers of intervention, acting in the overriding interests of the UK and its environment; participating in major national and international exercises reviewing all activities after significant incidents and exercises. Environment groups An environment group is set up to provide environmental advice to SOSREP during a serious marine pollution incident. There are 14 standing environment groups ( SEGs ) around England and Wales. Northern Ireland and Scotland each has their own group. SEGs provide information and advice on issues such as: conservation fisheries interests human health impacts best practice for disposal of wrecked ships and spoilt cargo oiled wildlife environmental monitoring SEGs include representatives from organisations including: MMO coastal offices the Environment Agency the Health Protection Agency Natural England/the Joint Nature Conservation Council/the Countryside Council for Wales local authorities Environmental Monitoring Monitoring occurs during and after an incident to make sure that environmental effects can be identified, understood, and reduced. PREMIAM (Pollution Response in Emergencies - Marine Impact Assessment and Monitoring) is an initiative funded by Defra to co-ordinate post incident environmental monitoring.

Get an oil spill treatment product approved: tests Marine Oil spills Marine Management Organisation All oil spill treatment products must be tested for their efficacy (effectiveness) and for toxicological hazard. The tests can be carried out within MMO-commissioned laboratories, or by independent laboratories selected by you. Independent laboratories must follow standard test protocols and have a recognised accreditation for the toxicity test, efficacy test, or both. Dispersant specifications and efficacy Products are tested to make sure they meet the specifications in appendix A to WSL Report LR448. This includes aspects of appearance, dynamic viscosity, flash point, cloud point, miscibility and efficiency. Efficacy is determined by a standard laboratory-based procedure described in annex 1 to appendix A WLS Report LR448. The efficacy test aims to assess the proportion of the total volume of treated oil that is dispersed into the water column. The minimum efficacy requirements depend on the type of dispersant being tested. Dispersants must achieve an efficact of 30% for type 1 (hydrocarbon solvent-based dispersant applied undiluted) and type 2 (concentrates diluted 1:10 with seawater before application) and 60% for type 3 (high efficacy concentrates applied undiluted). Efficacy tests Type of test Dispersant (inshore and offshore) Dispersant (offshore only) Sorbent Bioremediation product Degreaser WSL LR 448 Y Y N N N Flask Test N N N Y N Microcosm Test N N N Y N Toxicity to marine species There are 2 toxicity tests. The first test is called the Sea Test and is carried out using the brown shrimp (Crangon crangon). This test compares the relative toxicity of an oil dispersant mix to that of oil alone. The second test is called the Rocky Shore Test and is carried out using the common limpet (Patella vulgate). This test compares the toxicity of dispersant alone to that of the standard test oil. Offshore dispersants are not required to pass the Rocky Shore Toxicity Test, but may only be used in waters more than 12 nautical miles from the baseline.

Bioremediation products are subject to 2 further toxicity tests, and it will also be necessary to obtain microbiological hazard data. A licence is needed to introduce a new plant or animal species. If your bioremediation product contains a bacterial component you may need to apply for a wildlife licence.

/government/news/looks-fishy-dont-risk-it-campaign-targets-illegal-sale-of-fish,"Buying fish through illegitimate sources damages the fishing industry, fish stocks and the long term future of the marine environment.  Looks fishy? Don’t risk it. Campaign targets Illegal sale of fish  Marine Management Organisation This is the message being delivered as part of a new campaign by the Marine Management Organisation (MMO), which is appealing for the public to anonymously report potentially illegal sale of fish to Crime Stoppers. The campaign was launched on 11 April 2016 at an event attended by representatives of the fishing industry including the National Federation of Fisheries Organisation (NFFO), the Angling Trust and the Inshore Fisheries Conservation Authorities (IFCAs). The campaign is designed to promote adherence to the registered buyers and sellers scheme and to encourage the public to report any suspicions of illegal activity. Under the Registration of Buyers and Sellers (RBS) Scheme 2005, enforced by the MMO, only small quantities of fish can be purchased for personal consumption direct from a registered and licensed fishing vessel. Fish caught from recreational fishing activities cannot legally be sold and it should not be purchased. The campaign will see the MMO work to raise awareness of the rules through the media, online and through stakeholder organisations such as the British Hospitality Association, Angling Trust, the IFCAs as well as the NFFO. Information will also be distributed to fish and chip shops across the country through Seafish. Further information on the legal purchase of fish is available on the MMO website and any suspicions of illegal activity should be reported anonymously to Crime Stoppers on 0800 555 111. !@1 !@2 !@3 Commenting on the campaign George Eustice, Fisheries Minister, said: “Illegal fishing damages our marine environment and is not fair on those who do the right thing and play by the rules. So we are working closely with UK Port Health Authorities, environmental groups and industry to tackle the problem. Everyone has a role to play from the hospitality trade and the fishing industry to law enforcement agencies and shoppers. I would urge anyone with suspicions of illegal fishing activity to report it so that we protect both our marine environment and the livelihoods of law abiding fishermen.”"

/government/news/boat-operators-reminded-of-rules-on-protected-marine-mammals,"MMO recommends WiSe scheme to boat owners and operators as it issues reminder that dolphins, porpoise and whales are protected species. Boat operators reminded of rules on protected marine mammals  Marine Management Organisation The Marine Management Organisation (MMO) is reminding boat owners and operators of registered passenger and charter vessels about the rules and best practice relating to marine wildlife. As the warmer weather reaches English shores it brings with it increasing opportunities to observe dolphins, porpoises and whales. Whilst this is a fantastic opportunity for wildlife watchers and marine tourism, it is essential that the health and well-being of the animals is considered at all times. Endangered species dolphins, porpoises and whales are protected by wildlife legislation including the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. Under the Act it is an offence to intentionally and/or recklessly disturb these animals, with offences of disturbance carrying a maximum penalty of six months imprisonment and/or an unlimited fine. Disturbance by boats often causes stress and harm to dolphins, porpoises and whales, affecting their ability to feed, breed or nurture their young. To ensure the safety and appropriate protection of these animals the MMO recommend that boat and vessel owners follow the Wildlife Safe (WiSe) scheme . The scheme, which is a UK standard for commercial marine wildlife watching, includes a code of conduct and sets out best practice for wildlife watching. The code includes that boats should: stay 100 metres away from the animals avoid groups of mothers and young completely switch engines into neutral if animals actively come over to boats Animals must not be actively pursued when they move away, and where they bow ride alongside vessels, vessels should not increase their speed or change course. Animals must not be touched as this could be considered an offence. If you see dolphins, porpoise or whales being disturbed, please contact your nearest MMO office or local police force wildlife crime officer on 101. In Cornwall incidents can also be reported to the Cornwall Wildlife Trust on their 24 hour hotline 0345 201 2626 immediately. If possible photographs or video footage should also be taken of these concerns. These incidents will then be passed to the relevant enforcement authority. Notes Dolphins, porpoise and whales are protected under the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010, the Offshore Marine Conservation (Natural Habitats, & c.) Regulations 2007 and the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 In 2014 two boat skippers were successfully prosecuted by Devon and Cornwall Police for reckless disturbance of a pod of dolphins where one was found dead in Padstow, Cornwall The MMO is responsible for issuing wildlife licences to authorise what would otherwise be an offence under the nature conservation legislation. The MMO will only issue a licence in the English marine environment or the Welsh offshore environment where the activity meets certain purposes and where there is no satisfactory alternative The MMO is the statutory enforcement body for wildlife legislation that protects marine species in these waters More guidance on what is covered under nature conservation legislation is available from the MMO’s website [Contact:75]"

/government/consultations/allowing-vessels-targeting-plaice-in-the-north-sea-to-use-tr1-gears,"To allow vessels that target North Sea plaice using twin or multi rig gear to use a mesh size of greater than 100 mm (TR1), where they do not currently hold TR1 eligibility. Allowing vessels targeting plaice in the North Sea to use TR1 gears  Marine Management Organisation Under Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/2324 the days at sea allocations made to Member States for the TR1 and TR2 segments were merged. Our priority is to ensure that all English administered vessels have continuous access to a year-round fishery and hence we want use any surplus effort for this purpose or to support those vessels that are doing most for stock recovery. For those reasons we decided to retain the split in our rules for 2016-17. While considering this dispensation, the MMO is mindful of the need to minimise the potential impact on cod mortality. As such, the proposed change is directed at vessels targeting plaice in the North Sea, a fleet segment known to have significantly lower catch per unit effort for cod than the average of the TR1 fleet as a whole. Vessels would be required to demonstrate that they have sufficient plaice quota, sufficient cod quota to cover by-catch and must agree to avoid cod. Specifically vessels wishing to make use of this proposed option must meet the following criteria: contact the effort management team to request a new authorisation be issued; the change will not be automatic hold at least 1,000 tonnes North Sea plaice quota hold at least 15 tonnes North Sea cod quota be required to fish within the confines of the 5% cod catch per trip rules as outlined in section 7 of the Cod Recovery Scheme Rules vessels not complying with the 5% cod catch per trip rules will be reverted back to their previous allocation and eligibility should a vessel choose to notify for both TR1 and TR2 allocations, the TR1 allocation of days will be reduced in line with CRZ rule 4.4 (see link above). This rule already applies to all vessels notifying TR1 and TR2, and thus all vessels will be treated equally. This equates annually to 200 days (100 basic and 100 for <5% cod) of which a maximum of 135 days can be TR1. These days will be allocated pro-rata from the 1st of the month in which this change comes into effect should a vessel wish to apply for TR1 days only they will receive a pro-rata allocation of TR1 days from the 1st of the month the change comes into effect, providing the application is received during that month. Annually this would equate to 200 days (100 basic and 100 <5% cod) Based on records currently held by the MMO this change would be applicable to 6 vessels. The decision on whether this proposal is agreed will be taken after a consultation with industry, analysis of potential risks and benefits, and a scientific evaluation of its impacts. The potential benefits of the proposed change to TR1/TR2 gear for this activity are: mprovement in selectivity in the plaice fishery in the North Sea. a cut in the unmarketable catch, for example of reduce the capture of small plaice, dab and whiting. operations with more environmental and economic efficiency. The potential risks associated with the proposed change of TR1/TR2 gear are: increasing cod mortality if applied more generally to the North Sea TR2 fleet at large. We are seeking the views of industry stakeholders with an interest in the North Sea cod recovery zone. Please respond to the questions below: Should this change of scheme rules be permitted? Please give reasons. Do you agree with the minimum level of North Sea plaice (1,000 tonnes) and cod (15 tonnes) quota? If not, please explain and/or suggest alternative levels. Do you have any other comments that you think we need to consider when making this decision? The MMO are keen to consult with you on this subject and would welcome any comments by 12 noon on 27 May 2016. Please send all responses to the following address: effort@marinemanagement.org.uk"
/guidance/fast-track-and-accelerated-licensing,"Details of fast-track and accelerated licensing Fast-track and accelerated licensing Marine licences Marine Management Organisation Certain activities are not subject to the full marine licensing process , but instead go through a shortened and simplified process. The usual consultation stage is replaced with standard conditions as long as the application meets the general fast track eligibility criteria and specific requirements for the activity type, detailed below. A fast track licence can be issued for several activities and locations over a period of time. For example, placing racing buoys for several seasons, repainting structures or resurfacing a slipway in a marina. General fast-track criteria To qualify for fast track processing the activity should be low risk. It must include all necessary information and evidence to show that it meets the general criteria, which are that it: will not detrimentally affect protected areas or resources will not occur in an area used for military or defence purposes will not occur in an area hosting cables, pipelines or other structures will not generate unacceptable levels of noise will not combine with other activities to create detrimental effects is not likely to have a significant impact on the environment and will not require an environmental impact assessment has confirmation from the harbour authority that the activity can go ahead (if the activity is within a harbour authority’s limits) must not take place within a site of special scientific interest must fall within one of the fast track categories as detailed below (maintenance, clearance dredging, scaffolding and ladders, markers and buoys, minor removals, samples and investigations, burials at sea) Fast-track licensing in or near protected areas and resources If your activity might affect an area or feature of nature conservation to support your application you should provide: proof that any interest features will not be affected detrimentally a method statement, agreed and signed off by Natural England A method statement for Natural England approval should be sent to consultations@naturalengland.org.uk . The statement must include the following project details: location times, dates and duration of work equipment and processes to be used to carry out the work (methodology) provenance (origin) and chemical nature of any imported materials If your activity might affect a heritage designation site or an area or feature of known archaeological or historic interest, to support your application you should provide: proof that any interest features will not be affected detrimentally a method statement, agreed and signed off by Historic England or Protected Wrecks Consent. A method statement for Historic England approval should be sent to customers@historicengland.org.uk .

The statement must also include: location times, dates and duration of work equipment and processes to be used to carry out the work (methodology) Contamination If the activity could cause contamination, you must submit a preliminary assessment of the existing level of contamination in the area with your licence application. This should include: historic uses of the site past and current discharges records of previous incidents results of previous investigations or monitoring Maintenance activities Maintenance activities are the upkeep, repair or reasonable improvement of works within their existing boundaries. The work must not be a significant alteration, and it may qualify for fast track processing. This could cover such things as: removing, replacing, repairing, updating or reasonably improving bolts, flaps, valves, cathodic protection, access covers, grills, decking on a pier or pontoon, render or concrete, joints and health and safety equipment or other ancillary equipment attached to structures above the marine area repainting structures resurfacing a slipway replacing a single pile removing marine growth, pipe sediments and screenings installing ladders To be eligible for fast-track processing, the work must not be a significant alteration or require more than 1 pile. Some maintenance activities carried out by or on behalf of the Environment Agency , coast protection authorities and harbour authorities are exempt from requiring a marine licence. If you can provide a programme of planned future maintenance activities or works, all planned activities over an extended period (for example 5 years) may be covered in one licence. Clearance dredging You can find information on the licensing requirements for dredging on the Do I need a marine licence page. Clearance dredging may be suitable for fast-track processing where the dredging campaigns are separated by at least 1 month. Also, the material to be moved must not exceed: 1,500 cubic metres in the same area for any other dredging activity in the year before the current application 500 cubic metres in any single dredging campaign – one or more dredging operations to achieve the same objective in an area Applications must include an assessment of risks of contamination. Scaffolding and ladders Applications to erect scaffolding and ladders will usually qualify for fast-track processing if: it is not associated with other licensable activities no solid horizontal boarding placed would be within 1 metre (vertical height) of the foreshore for a period of more than a week no solid horizontal boarding would be used when there is an existing viable alternative Markers and buoys You can find information on the licensing requirements for markers and buoys on the Do I need a marine licence page. Marker buoys and posts will usually qualify for fast-track processing if they are: to be located individually (rather than in groups like mooring buoys) not to be placed within a recognised anchorage will be of specified dimensions Minor removals You can find information on the licensing requirements for removal activities on the Do I need a marine licence page. Some applications for minor removals may also be suitable for fast-track processing. This can include: litter or minor objects that are seperate, such as poles, girders or joists debris from recent construction or demolition, that have been on the sea bed or surface of the intertidal for no more than a few years Your application must be accompanied by a preliminary assessment confirming that the object is not contaminated and that its removal will not cause pollution. The removal must also: take place without significant disturbance to the surrounding area take no longer than 24 hours not take place within, or in the approaches of, an International Maritime Organisation Traffic Separation Scheme not pose a risk to navigation be of an object of recent origin not take place in an site of special scientific interest Please note that removals of flotsam (floating wreckage of a ship or its cargo), jetsam (part of a ship, its equipment, or its cargo that is purposely cast overboard), and other items resulting from a shipwreck are not eligible for fast-track processing. Samples and investigations You can find information on the licensing requirements for samples and investigation on the Do I need a marine licence page. Boreholes Boreholes further than 1 nautical mile from shore may be suitable for fast-track processing if each sample extracted is no more than 4 cubic metres in volume and is at least 500 metres from any other in the same application. A single application cannot contain more than 20 samples. Boreholes less than 1 nautical mile from shore may also be suitable for fast-track processing if each sample extracted is at least 25 metres from any other in the same application. A single application cannot contain more than 5 samples. Borehole applications should include information about its position relative to a source protection zone (groundwater used directly for drinking water) or principal aquifer . Sediment samples Sediment samples may be suitable for fast-track processing if each sample extracted is no more than 4 cubic metres in volume. Trial pits in the intertidal area can cover an area of up to 1 metre x 4 metres (4 square metres) and be up to 2 metres deep. Each pit must be at least 10 metres from any other pit in the same application and there cannot be more than 5 in an application. Trial pits in the subtidal area can cover an area of up to 2 metres x 4 metres (8 square metres) and be up to 2 metres deep. Each pit must be at least 100 metres from any other pit in the same application and there cannot be more than 20 in an application. Burials at sea Information on burials at sea can be found on the Get a licence for a burial at sea in England page Accelerated licensing for dredging You can find information on the licensing requirements for dredging on the Do I need a marine licence? page. If your dredging activity is between 500 and 3,000 cubic metres a campaign, and less than 10,000 cubic metres a year, it may be processed with a 10-working-day consultation. You must be able to demonstrate the low-risk nature through complying with agreed criteria and local or regional conditions. MMO aims to decide qualifying applications within 20 working days. If the activity has been assessed as part of a maintenance dredging baseline document or other agreed assessment, details should be included with the application and any conditions that form part of that assessment will be considered. Activities will be licensed through this faster process if: dredging is ongoing and has been carried out in the same way for at least 3 years campaigns are separated by at least 1 month evidence on the quality of the sediment is provided the project is assessed as part of a maintenance dredging baseline document or another form of assessment agreed with Natural England Other criteria relating to environmental protection and interference with other legitimate uses of the sea must also be met before a dredging activity can be confirmed as appropriate for the accelerated licensing process. You must provide information on the physical and chemical characteristics of the dredged material with the application for it to be considered full and complete. You must provide 1 surface sample that is representative of the area to be dredged for activities between 500 and 1,000 cubic metres a campaign and less than 10,000 cubic metres a year. You must provide 2 surface samples that are representative of the area to be dredged for activities between 1,000 and 3,000 cubic metres a campaign and less than 10,000 cubic metres a year. Where your application does not meet this accelerated licensing for dredging criteria the full marine licensing process will need to be followed.

/government/news/company-director-fined-1413,"Company director fined £1,413 for breaches of registration of fish buyers and sellers and transportation regulations Company director fined £1,413  Marine Management Organisation On 7 July 2016 Mr Andrew de la Haye, of Jersey, entered guilty pleas to charges contrary to the Registration of Fish Buyers and Sellers and Designation of Fish Auction Sites Regulations 2005 (“the RBS regulation”) and the Fisheries Act 1981. The court heard how Mr de la Haye, between January and May 2014, had purchased and transported catches of whelks. Mr de la Hay was the director of a company named Ocean Royale Limited which had been dissolved in the preceding year. All of these purchases were, therefore, made by an unregistered business. For each of 28 occasions whelks were purchased and no sales note was submitted to the MMO in accordance with regulations governing the purchase of first sale fish. The total quantity of whelks involved was valued at £64,136.40 Additionally, on each of these 28 occasions, and a further 26 times (56 in total), the whelks were transported from the place of landing without a transport document being submitted to the MMO. The total quantity of whelks was valued at £106,020.60. Mr de la Haye pleaded guilty to an offence contrary to regulation 8 of the RBS regulation and an offence contrary to s.30(1) of the Fisheries Act 1981 as read with article 68 of Council Regulation (EC) 1224/2009. The court gave Mr de la Haye credit for an early guilty plea and ordered him to pay fines to a total of £860.00, together with a contribution towards the costs of prosecution of £500 and a £53 victim surcharge; a total of £1,413.00. Commenting on the case Phil Haslam (MMO Director of Operations) said: “This case sends out a clear message that the MMO will prosecute parties for failure to submit the required paperwork, whether that be sales notes or transport documents. This documentation is important as it tracks the source of fish caught and allows us to gain an accurate picture of fish stocks, on which to base fisheries management decisions. The MMO are currently carrying out a campaign to encourage adherence to the registered buyers and sellers regulations and more information on our “Looks Fishy campaign” is available on our website .

An email stating the vessel name, dates of the survey, type of survey and equipment used should be sent to dispensationrequests@marinemanagement.org.uk Examples of activities that require a dispensation include: using undersized nets or modified trawls catching and keeping on board undersized fish species fishing beyond set effort management limits (days at sea) catching and landing fish over a vessel’s catch limits – MMO may be able to provide extra quota to licensed fishing vessels involved in research catching and landing fish stocks for which a vessel has no quota allocation Licensing and consenting requirements You may require additional licenses and consents to carry out your proposed research. This is relevant regardless of which type of vessel you are using, and whether you require a fisheries dispensation. Protected species A marine wildlife licence is required by anyone who wishes to carry out an activity in the English marine area or the Welsh offshore area that is prohibited under nature conservation legislation where the activity cannot be sufficiently mitigated against. Marine licensing requirements Work within the dispensation application may also require a marine licence or application for an exemption. It is the applicants responsibility to ensure that they have all relevant licences in place before they start any survey. Information on the application process and list of licensable activities is available. Marine Protected Areas (MPA) The MMO is responsible for making byelaws in English inshore waters to protect European Marine Sites ( EMS ) and Marine Conservation Zones ( MCZs ) from activities that may harm them; these may be commercial and/or recreational. MMO byelaws must help to further the conservation objectives of the site. You may be required to comply with these byelaws and, unless stated, the derogation does not allow you to operate where it is not permitted within the sites. Your dispensation application will ask you to provide details of any marine protected area you may be operating in. A map and details of all marine protected areas can be found on the Joint Nature Conservation Committee ( JNCC ) website. Foreign vessels engaged in research or UK vessels which do not complete a dispensation application are encouraged to complete a voluntary notification form if the survey will take place within or close to an MPA. MPA activity - Voluntary notification form Other authority consents You may also require consent or approval from other bodies before you are able to carry out the work that the dispensation applies to.

/government/consultations/farne-deeps-vessel-eligibility,"Consultation into allowing vessels that are highly dependent on nephrops in the Farne Deeps using twin-rig or multi-rig gear to be awarded eligibility to receive allocation for TR1 days at sea. Farne Deeps vessel eligibility  Marine Management Organisation Proposal To allow vessels that target nephrops using twin or multi rig gear to use a mesh size of greater than 100 mm (TR1), where they do not currently hold TR1 eligibility either as a dual TR1 and TR2 allocation or as a single TR1 allocation. Background Vessels currently fishing under the Days at Sea Scheme as introduced through the Cod Plan European Council Regulation (EU) 1342/2008 targeting nephrops in the Farne Deeps are restricted in ICES rectangles 38E8, 38E9, 39E8, 39E9, 40E8 and 40E9 by new licence conditions aimed at reducing the overall fishing pressure on the Farne Deeps nephrops stock. The measures are as follows: Vessel owners will be required to use a minimum mesh size of 90mm using single twine of 5mm. Only single-rig vessels of 350kW (476hp) or less will be permitted to fish within 12mn of the coast. Multi-rig vessels (vessels with three or more rigs) will be prohibited from operating within the Farne Deeps. Twin rig vessels will be permitted to operate outside 12nm. No vessel will be permitted to use gear with multiple cod ends per rig. Due to the restrictions outlined above, vessels highly dependent on Farne Deeps nephrops (> 50 % of annual landed value in either of 2013 - 2015) currently eligible to use only TR2 gears will have limited fishing opportunities in the area due to being unable to access the nephrops fishery. In order to provide more opportunity for diversification away from Farne Deeps nephrops, we propose to: Allow twin/multi-rig vessels that will be prohibited from operating within the Farne Deeps eligibility to fish with TR1 gears, where they currently lack eligibility. If we allow those currently unable to fish with TR1 gear to do so, we would propose starting this measure on 1st September 2016 there will be 153 calendar days until the end of the CRZ Scheme on 31 January 2017. Alternatively allow vessels to apply for TR1 days only and do not use further TR2 days. Allocations would be as follows: Allocation Days TR1 Basic Allocation 41 Days TR1 and TR2 Basic Allocation 72 Days of which 14 can be fished using TR1 gear TR1 5% Cod Allocation 83 Days TR1 and TR2 5% Cod Allocation 83 Days Vessels wishing to make use of these options will be required to re-notify for days at sea and cannot utilise these days until receipt of an authorisation letter. Based on our records 22 vessels have been identified as highly dependent on the Farne Deeps nephrops fishery. Of these, 6 vessels currently do not have TR1 eligibility, 3 vessels do not appear to be active under the CRZ scheme and the rest have joint TR1 and TR2 eligibility. The decision on whether this proposal is agreed will be taken after a consultation with industry, analysis of potential risks and benefits, and evaluation of its impacts. We are seeking the views of industry stakeholders with an interest in the Farne Deeps. Please respond to the questions below: Should this change of scheme rules be permitted? Please give reasons. Is the criteria for vessels highly dependent on Farne Deeps nephrops (i.e. those vessels which can demonstrate landings of Farne Deeps Nephrops amounting to greater than 50% of annual landed value in any one of the quota years 2013-2015) set at a high enough threshold? Do you have any other comments that you think we need to consider when making this decision? The MMO are keen to consult with you on this subject and would welcome any comments by midnight on the 26th August 2016. The MMO has considered that the relatively short period for consultation allowed is appropriate, given the relatively low impact of these proposals, coupled with the need to make any relevant changes that are appropriate after consultation as soon as possible in order to provide enhanced fishing effort opportunities as soon as possible. Please send all responses to the following address effort@marinemanagement.org.uk ."

The framework should provide a systematic, auditable and repeatable process that can be used across the whole MPA network. It is recognised that the relevance and importance of activities will vary between sites locally and regionally. Also valuable to this requirement is the completion of assessments for all MPA sites, to complement the existing evidence base for MPAs.

/government/publications/manage-your-fishing-effort-cod-recovery-zone,"Detailed scheme rules and application forms to fish in the Cod Recovery Zone with regulated gears. Manage your fishing effort: Cod Recovery Zone 2016/2017  Marine Management Organisation The following rules apply to the carriage and use of regulated gears in the Cod Recovery Zone (‘ CRZ ’) for the 2016-17 Management Year (which runs from 1st February 2016 to 31st January 2017). The rules apply in the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (‘ ICES ’) areas in the North Sea ( ICES Area IIa (EU) & IV), West of Scotland ( ICES Area Vb (EU) & VIa), Eastern Channel VIId and the Irish Sea ( ICES Area VIIa). Days at sea will be allocated on the basis that vessels comply with the rules set out below. Compliance with the rules is a requirement of your fishing vessel licence, and there are other conditions on your licence which are associated with these rules. Failure to comply with these rules or any condition of your fishing vessel licence is likely to be investigated and may result in action being taken in line with the Marine Management Organisation’s ( MMO ) Compliance and Enforcement Strategy, including (where appropriate) prosecution. These rules may be regularly updated or amended during the 2016/17 Management Year, and it is recommended that you check these rules on a regular basis. In addition you should also be familiar with the relevant EU and UK national legislation governing the carriage and use of regulated gears in the CRZ . 1. Eligibility to fish with regulated gears in the Cod Recovery Zone ( CRZ ) 1.1 A vessel will be eligible to carry and use regulated gears in the CRZ where either: the vessel has a record of fishing activity with regulated gear in the years 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004 or 2005; or eligibility has been obtained via the transfer of a single licence (or the aggregation of two or more licences) where the originating vessel(s) has such a record of fishing 1.2 Eligible vessels must apply to the MMO for an allocation of effort days in order to undertake fishing activity within the CRZ using regulated gear. 1.3 In addition, a licence entitlement which is administered by the MMO which has CRZ eligibility may apply for an allocation of effort days. 1.4 Vessels with eligibility may use any gears below their highest level of eligibility. 1.5 Gear hierarchy 2016/17: TR1 BT1 BT2 GN1 GT1 LL1 TR2 TR3 ### Table 1: Basic Allocation of effort days by gear type for the 2016/17 Management Year: Gear type Mesh size or type Maximum number of days allocated as a flat rate* (and maximum transfer limits) Of the maximum allocation, the total number of days permitted to fish in North Sea West of Scotland Irish Sea TR1 Equal to or larger than 100mm 100 (20%) 100 82 82 TR2 Equal to or larger than 70mm and less than 100mm 100 (20%) 100 82 75 TR3 Equal to or larger than 16mm and less than 32mm 228 (30%) 228 across all areas BT1 Equal to or larger than 120mm 152 (30%) 152 across all areas BT2 Equal to or larger than 80mm and less than 120mm 152 (30%) 152 across all areas GN1 Gill nets, entangling nets 170 (30%) 170 across all areas GT1 Trammel nets 140 (30%) 140 across all areas LL1 Longlines 172 (30%) 172 across all areas Days at sea will be allocated proportionally for management periods under 12 months. 2. Carrying regulated gears 2.1 If you are intending to carry regulated gears in the CRZ for the full duration of the 2016/17 management year – from 1 February 2016 to 31 January 2017 – the master of the vessel (or their representative) must submit an application form to their local MMO coastal office before 11 January 2016, notifying them which regulated gear(s) they intend to carry for the year. 2.2 Where an application for an allocation of effort days relates to a management period which is less than the full 2016/17 management year (one month or more), the basic allocation of effort days will be a proportion of the above figures in table 1 . 2.3 An application to transfer in days for a vessel which does not have eligibility in its own right will also be considered a notification. 2.4 Any vessel fishing in the CRZ without notifying MMO will be in breach of its licence conditions and therefore subject to investigation. Please note: the MMO will not accept applications for allocations made after the start of the management period to which they apply and in no circumstances will an allocation of effort days be back-dated to cover the carriage and use of regulated gear prior to the allocation. 2.5 Only one type of regulated gear must be carried on board at any time unless an exemption has been issued by MMO . 2.6 Upon notification by the MMO , the master or licence holder must permit an observer to be on board the vessel during a fishing trip within the CRZ . 2.7 Vessels may only transit through the CRZ other than in accordance with these rules if they comply with the requirements set out in articles 29 and 47 of Council Regulation (EC) 1224/2009. 3. Real Time and Seasonal Closures 3.1 The vessel must not be present in any of the areas specified in the vessel’s licence (please note: closed areas will be varied on a regular basis), other than when transiting at a speed of greater than six knots except in the case of force majeure or adverse conditions. MMO RTC closures, as with the closures introduced by Marine Scotland, are compulsory for all UK vessels of 10 metres and over, using demersal trawls (including otter, beam and seines), fixed nets (including gill, entangling and trammel) and longlines other than FDF vessels who are permitted within the MMO and Scottish RTC ’s. 4. Basic days at sea allocation 4.1 MMO will issue a fishing authorisation to eligible vessels after receiving an application form. The master of the vessel must carry their authorisation on board at all times when absent from port and in the CRZ carrying regulated gears. While waiting to receive your fishing authorisation, any vessel at sea must carry a copy of its completed notification form on board at all times when absent from port and in the CRZ carrying regulated gears. 4.2 English-administered licence entitlements may be eligible to receive an allocation of days. An eligible entitlement that has applied and received an allocation of days is permitted to transfer these allocated days to an active vessel – transfers from entitlements are limited to 20% of the overall allocation of days. 4.3 Where a vessel notifies more than one gear type, its allocation of days will be the average of the rates for the categories notified. For example, where a vessel notifies TR1 and another gear, its maximum allocation of days will be the average of the two rates, and the TR1 days will be limited to the maximum number according to table 1 . 4.4 Where a vessel notifies TR1 and TR2, the TR1 allocation of days will be reduced. In this case, the vessel will be allocated the number of days that would have been allocated to a vessel notifying TR1 only, minus 65 days in the North Sea and 50 days in the Irish Sea and West of Scotland (or proportionally for management periods under 12 months). 5. Recording your time at sea 5.1 TR1 Effort is counted in whole calendar days: therefore any period of activity for TR1 during a single calendar day is counted as one effort day. 5.2 Effort for all other gear types is recorded in hours; therefore 24 hours of activity is counted as one effort day, whether or not that use is continuous and whether or not parts of that 24 hour total fall in different calendar days. 5.3 Time at sea will not count against a vessel’s allocation where it comes to the aid of another vessel in need of emergency assistance or because it is transporting an injured person for emergency medical aid. The MMO must be advised as soon as possible. 5.4 Any time spent carrying (or using) regulated gears within the CRZ west of the French Line is not included as part of any calculation of effort days used, provided that during that time the vessel has installed and operating a vessel monitoring system. The ‘French Line’ is an imaginary line between the following points: Point A 60º15’N 04º00’W Point B 60º00’N 04º50’W Point C 59º40’N 05º30’W Point D 59º40’N 06º05’W Point E 59º20’N 06º30’W Point F 59º00’N 07º30’W Point G 58º40’N 07º40’W Point H 58º10’N 09º00’W Point J 57º50’N 09º20’W Point K 57º20’N 09º20’W Point L 57º00’N 09º00’W Point M 56º40’N 08º55’W Point N 55º30’N 09º20’W Point P 55º20’N 09º50’W Point Q 54º30’N 10º35’W 5.5 As in previous years in is the responsibility of the vessel owner to monitor the number of effort days used. 6. Participating in the Catch Quota Scheme 6.1 Eligible vessels participating in the Catch Quota Scheme will be allocated additional effort as follows: for vessels using TR1 – 105 additional effort days for vessels using GN1 – 50 additional effort days 6.2 A further allocation of days may be available for vessels taking part in the Catch Quota Scheme upon request. In order to be considered for a further allocation of effort days a written request and supporting business case should be made to the MMO after 30 April 2016. These requests will be considered on a case-by-case basis and must be made before effort allocation is exhausted. 6.3 Vessels participating in the Catch Quota Scheme may not receive extra days through other exemptions or schemes. Vessels participating in the Catch Quota Scheme will not be permitted to transfer out days. 6.4 On the first occasion that your vessel reaches a 50 day or less balance of effort days the MMO where possible will advise the vessel nominee. If necessary the vessel must access additional days before fishing. This letter is only issued the first time you reach a balance of 50 days or less and it is your responsibility to ensure you have enough days before you begin each fishing trip. 7. Vessels that catch less than 5% cod 7.1 Eligible vessels can apply for an additional allocation of effort days provided that every use of the regulated gear within the CRZ will result in less than 5% of the total catch per fishing trip consisting of cod. 7.2 An additional allocation of up to 100 effort days can be applied for on this basis, subject to an overall cap of 200 days. 7.3 This additional allocation is conditional upon the 5% threshold. If in any given fishing trip cod comprises more than 5% of the vessels total catch, the full additional allocation will be withdrawn with immediate effect, and the vessel will revert to the basic allocation of effort days for the remainder of the relevant management period. 7.4 Where a vessel has exceeded the 5% cod threshold on any fishing trip during a previous management year, that vessel will not be eligible for the additional allocation described above in the 2016/17 management year. 7.5 If you wish to appeal a decision relating to this derogation you must submit a letter to MMO ’s Effort Management Team. An appeal letter should include an explanation of what additional measures will be taken to ensure compliance in the future. Appeals will be considered on a case-by-case basis and vessels should continue to operate under a basic allocation until a decision has been made. 8. Vessel targeting plaice in the North Sea without TR1 eligibility 8.1 Vessels currently without TR1 eligibility wishing to target plaice in the North Sea will be eligible to notify for an allocation of TR1 days providing the vessel notifies and fishes in accordance with the conditions of the less than 5% cod catch per trip rules as outlined in section 7 of the rules above, and meet the following criteria that the vessel has access to at least: 1,000 tonnes North Sea plaice quota, and 15 tonnes North Sea cod quota 8.2 Vessel owners seeking to apply for this additional allocation must demonstrate eligibility in accordance with 8.1 in writing, with confirmation that the PO of which the vessel is a member has allocated to it (including any swaps) sufficient quota to comply and confirming that the vessel is eligible to fish against it OR written confirmation that the vessel has leased sufficient quota to be eligible. 8.3 This option is not automatic for qualifying vessels. Any vessel wishing to make use of this option must to submit a new “application for days at sea” form, attaching evidence to demonstrate their fulfilment of the criteria set out in section 8.1. 8.4 Allocations of TR1 days will be made in the same way as for any other vessel eligible to use TR1 gears under the cod 5% rules. If an authorisation for both TR1 and TR2 days is requested the reduction in TR1 days described in section 4.4 will apply. The allocation of TR1 days will be awarded pro-rata from the 1June 2016. 8.5 In line with section 4.1 of these rules, TR1 gears must not be used until a written fishing authorisation from the MMO giving an allocation of days to the vessel is received by the applicant. 8.6 Any vessel using this proposed option that does not comply with the 5% cod catch per trip rules will be reverted back to their previous allocation and eligibility. The provisions of sections 7.3 to 7.5 of these rules apply to an allocation of TR1 days under this section. 8.7 The vessel owner must notify the MMO as soon as reasonably practicable if the eligibility criteria in section 8.1 ceases to be met and failure to do so constitutes a breach of these rules. Vessels which cease to meet the criteria in section 8.1 will have TR1 eligibility removed for the remainder of the 2016/17 management year and will not be eligible for a further allocation of days. 9. Vessel targeting nephrops in the Farne Deeps without TR1 eligibility 9.1 Twin/multi-rig vessels currently without TR1 eligibility that historically target nephrops in the Farne Deeps ( ICES rectangles 38E8, 38E9, 39E8, 39E9, 40E8 and/or 40E9) will be eligible to notify for an allocation of TR1 days or a multiple gear (TR1/TR2) days allocation. 9.2 Vessel owners seeking to apply for this additional allocation must demonstrate that they are highly dependent on the nephrops fishery in the areas outlined above in accordance with 9.1 in writing. 9.3 This option is not automatic for qualifying vessels. Any vessel wishing to make use of this option must to submit a new “application for days at sea” form, attaching evidence to demonstrate their fulfilment of the criteria set out in section 9.1. 9.4 Allocations of TR1 days will be made in the same way as for any other vessel eligible to use TR1 gears. If an authorisation for both TR1 and TR2 days is requested the reduction in TR1 days described in section 4.4 will apply. The allocation of TR1 days will be awarded pro-rata from the 1 September 2016 once the MMO has validated the eligibility of the applicant. 9.5 Additional days will be allocated to those vessels that agree to fish under the 5% cod rules as found at point 7. 9.6 In line with section 4.1 of these rules, TR1 gears must not be used until a written fishing authorisation from the MMO giving an allocation of days to the vessel is received by the applicant. 10. TR2 vessels fishing for nephrops in the Irish Sea 10.1 A vessel: which is not exempt from effort controls; in relation to which there has been an application for a basic allocation of effort days in the CRZ for the use of TR2; and which is to undertake fishing activity in the Irish Sea ( ICES Area VIIa) targeting nephrops (i.e. catching 300kg or more of nephrops in any one fishing trip) must use one of the approved highly selective gear types throughout the management period. The highly selective gears are: (1) 200mm square mesh panel developed for the nephrop fishery in North West England in 2012 and 2013 (2) 200mm square mesh panel (only available for vessels 12 metres or under in length) (3) 300mm square mesh panel (4) Seltra ‘300’ trawl (5) Seltra ‘270’ trawl (6) Faithlie panel (7) Flip-Flap trawl (8) Net Grid or variants (9) inclined separator panel (10) Swedish Grid 10.2 Detailed information on the specifications of these (gear types)[https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/manage-your-fishing-effort-cod-recovery-zone] is available. 10.3 Vessels which are required to use highly selective gear for this purpose will receive an additional allocation of effort days for use in the Irish Sea. 10.4 A vessel which does not meet the three criteria under paragraph 8.1 above must not retain on board or land more than 300kg of nephrops per fishing trip. 11. TR2 vessels fishing for nephrops in the North Sea 11.1 Any TR2 vessel fishing for nephrops in the North Sea, defined as a nephrops vessel (see paragraph 8.1 for a definition), has the option to use one of a number of highly selective gear types listed below: Net Grid Net Grid variant 1 Net Grid variant 2 11.2 Detailed information on the specifications of these (gear types)[https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/manage-your-fishing-effort-cod-recovery-zone] is available. 12. Allocating extra days at sea 12.1 Vessels may receive extra days where they agree to fish using one of the specified selective gears listed below during the management period. 12.2 The Eliminator Trawl - This option is available to TR1 vessels. Vessels adopting this will receive an extra allocation of 24 days if they use gear that has all of the following features: all top sheet wing netting sections and lower sheet wing netting sections must be made of diamond mesh netting of at least 600mm mesh size the belly panel must be made of diamond mesh netting of at least 600mm mesh size and must extend across the full width of the trawl. It must be attached directly to the fishing line and extend toward the rear of the net for at least 7.5 metres (stretched length) all top sheet netting directly above and forward of the belly panel must be made of diamond mesh netting of at least 600mm mesh size 12.3 130mm cod end - This option is available to TR1 vessels carrying gear with a cod end of mesh size 130mm or greater. Vessels adopting this will receive an extra allocation of 8 days. 13. Transferring days at sea 13.1 Transfers of days at sea will be limited to a set percentage of a vessel’s allocation (see table 1 ). However, any catch quota vessel or vessel that receives extra days due to the use of highly selective gears or catching less than 5% cod will not be permitted to transfer out days once days are transferred to a vessel they may not be transferred out transfers of days will only be allowed where the donor and recipient are both administered by MMO vessels that are ineligible to carry regulated gears can transfer in days from eligible vessels to allow them to fish in the CRZ 13.2 Where a transfer takes place, the number of days received will be adjusted in proportion to the comparative fishing capacity (measured in engine power) of the vessels involved. 13.3 Once you have submitted an application to transfer days to your vessel, you must wait for written confirmation that those days have been credited to your vessel before beginning to fish against those extra days. 13.4 Transfers from licence entitlements will be limited to 20% of the overall allocation of days. 14. Transferring eligibility to fish with regulated gear 14.1 Where a vessel owner wishes to transfer eligibility to the licence before a change of ownership of either vessel, licence, or both, they must notify the (local MMO coastal office)[https://www.gov.uk/contact-local-marine-management-organisation] and provide written evidence confirming that this has been agreed by both parties. 14.2 In cases where a vessel with eligibility is sold without its licence and MMO has not been notified of any transfer of eligibility or documentary evidence has not been provided, it will be assumed that eligibility remains with the purchased vessel. 14.3 Where eligibility is obtained via the transfer and combination of two or more licences, each licence must hold eligibility to carry or use regulated gears within the CRZ . Where eligibility is acquired through combining multiple licences, each of the licences contributing engine power must carry eligibility to fish within the CRZ with regulated gear. Where the gear eligibility of each licence differs, the resulting licence will have the eligibility of the highest common denominator of the combined parts. 14.4 Where an eligible licence is split, each part of the licence carries the same eligibility as the original licence (unless the part of the licence does not carry engine power). 15. Changing administration 15.1 Changes in administration will only be considered in cases where there is a genuine operational transfer. 15.2 All requests for changes into English administration by vessels with CRZ eligibility will take into consideration the current eligibility of the vessel and its contribution to the 2004 to 2006 effort baseline. Decisions will be made on a case-by-case basis. Appeals to such decisions can be made by submitting a letter to MMO ’s Effort Management Team. 15.3 Any vessel currently under English administration wishing to transfer to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland must contact the administration it wishes to transfer to in order to ensure their eligibility is transferable. 15.4 Vessels entering English administration will not be eligible to fish in the CRZ until MMO issues an authorisation in writing. 16. Once your allocation of days are used 16.1 When a vessel has exhausted its allocation of effort days, the vessel must cease using the regulated gears within the CRZ immediately and return to port. Further use of the regulated gears within the CRZ during the rest of the management period may only occur following a completed transfer of additional effort days to the vessel. Retrospective transfers will not be permitted.

Requirement detail Scallop fishing is not a widely managed activity. With the exception of effort restrictions for 15m and over vessels in area VII, there is limited understanding of fisheries behaviour and whether fishing activities are at a sustainable level. Work to identify current available scallop stocks in English waters and how this has changed through time will help improve forecasting of stock behaviour. The project should include bringing together historic fisheries behaviour with knowledge on fisheries decision making, where potentially the fishery is being driven by external factors beyond stock availability.

/government/news/father-and-son-fined-10213-for-fisheries-offences-in-case-brought-by-mmo,"On 12 September 2016 Thomas Copp and Gary Copp entered guilty pleas for breaching fisheries regulations at Weymouth Magistrates Court. Father and son fined £10,213 for fisheries offences in case brought by MMO  Marine Management Organisation The court heard how in January 2016 whilst operating the under 10 metre fishing vessel “Charisma NN111” Thomas Copp (vessel owner) and Gary Copp (vessel master) exceeded the under 10 metre monthly catch limit in Area VIIe for sole, and failed to accurately record the area of capture for sole in the vessel’s logbook . The monthly limit for sole in area VIIe was 30kg, however the vessel landed some 287.86kgs of sole in excess of the catch limit. Initially logbook records submitted by the vessel master showed this overfish was caught in ICES Area VIId, which had a larger monthly limit, however investigation by officers from the Marine Management Organisation (MMO) established that the fish was actually caught and retained in Area VIIe, with the master completing his records to show an inaccurate area of capture. The court sentenced Thomas Copp to fines totalling £2445 and costs of £2541.50, with a victim surcharge of £120. Gary Copp was then sentenced on the same basis leading to total fine and costs of £10,213. A spokesman for the MMO said: “In this case the defendants submitted an incorrect logbook report and exceeded their monthly catch limits. Such actions damage the viability of fish stocks for future generations and the law abiding fishing industry. The MMO will not hesitate to take the appropriate action when illegal activity is detected up to and including, as in this case, a prosecution leading to substantial fines.”"

/government/collections/managing-fisheries-in-marine-protected-areas,"How fisheries activities are assessed and managed in marine protected areas (MPA) Managing fisheries in marine protected areas Regulations, monitoring and enforcement Marine Protected sites and species Marine Management Organisation Fishing in marine protected areas Our seas have a great variety of marine life and habitats, many of which are rare and of national importance. Marine protected areas (MPAs) help make sure that these are guarded from the increasing pressures of human activity. There over 250 marine protected areas in English waters. These include European marine sites and marine conservation zones. European marine sites (EMS) are protected under the European Union Habitats Directive and Birds Directive. There are currently over 200 EMSs. They include: special areas of conservation (SACs) – designated for habitats special protection areas (SPAs) – designated for rare and vulnerable birds Marine conservation zones (MCZs) protect species and habitats of national importance and are designated under the Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009 . There are currently over 50 designated MCZs. To view all English marine protected areas visit our Marine Information System . Managing commercial fishing activity in marine protected areas We are currently consulting on a new byelaw for Margate and Long Sands EMS. You can read the draft byelaw and associated documents and take part in the consultation . The impact of any licensable activity or development in or near an MPA is looked at as part of the marine licensing process . However fishing activity is not part of this process. Instead fishing activity in an MPA is managed and monitored through a separate process, which includes six main steps: site designation site allocated to a regulator to assess, manage and monitor (Defra, MMO, Inshore Fisheries and Conservation Authority - IFCA) MPA assessment (inshore sites)/ Joint Recommendation (offshore sites) management measures recommended (public consultation) proposed measures introduced (byelaw/ Council regulation) site monitored Site designation: An MPA is designated by the secretary of state for environment, food and rural affairs. Sites are designated following public consultation and analysis by Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC) and Natural England. Site allocated to regulator: There are three different organisations responsible for assessing, managing and monitoring MPAs. These are: Inshore Fisheries and Conservation Authorities : inshore 0 to 6nm Marine Management Organisation: inshore 6 to 12nm Defra: offshore 12 to 200nm (depending on feature location can be 6-200nm) MPA Assessment/Joint Recommendation: To understand what impact fishing activity is having on an MPA, an MPA assessment is completed. It provides information on the MPA designated feature(s), details of what fishing activity takes places within the area and the impact of this activity on the site feature(s). Site management: If the MPA assessment finds that commercial fishing activity may have a significant effect, the next step is to identify how to avoid or mitigate the impacts. This includes potential management measures, which are recommended in consultation with a range of sector and industry representatives. Management of fishing activity within an MPA will be only applied to the affected area of an MPA, rather than the entire site, if the evidence is available. This allows for the feature to be protected, whilst enabling fishing activity which does not have a significant impact to continue. Not all MPA sites need permanent management measures for fishing activity. If the MPA assessment finds that the fishing activity does not have a significant impact on the MPA features, management measures will not be implemented. However, to ensure any changes in site activities are captured, the site will be monitored. You can find out more about how fishing activity is being managed in MPAs. Management measures - Byelaw Management measures to reduce the impact of fishing activities within MPAs in the inshore (0-12nm) are introduced through a byelaw. The byelaw sets out the affected area within the MPA and the fishing activity restrictions. All permanent byelaws are subject to public consultation before they are introduced. We are currently consulting on a new byelaw for Margate and Long Sands EMS. You can read the draft byelaw and associated documents and take part in the consultation . Site monitoring Due to the changing nature of our seas, site features can change over time. Also our understanding of MPA sites and the impact of fishing activity on them continues to increase. It is important that we continue to monitor all MPA sites, to ensure their features remain protected and enable fishing to continue where possible.

/guidance/marine-conservation-byelaws,"How byelaws are made and what they protect. Understand marine conservation byelaws Regulations, monitoring and enforcement Protected sites and species Marine Management Organisation The Marine Management Organisation ( MMO ) is responsible for making byelaws in English inshore waters to protect European marine sites ( EMS ) and marine conservation zones (MCZs) from activities that may harm them. MMO byelaws must help to further the conservation objectives of the site. The MMO has the power to make byelaws within 0-12 nautical miles. For the management of commercial fishing activities, MMO will lead on the management between 6-12 nautical miles, with the Inshore Fisheries and Conservation Authorities (IFCA) leading in the 0-6 nautical miles area. MMO will consider voluntary measures before making a byelaw. If a permanent byelaw is required, this will be formally consulted upon. Please see the Byelaw-making process for further information. Current MMO byelaws Following a public consultation between September and October 2013 and a formal notification to the European Commission and other member states, the Secretary of State confirmed MMO byelaws to protect reef features from bottom towed fishing in specified areas between 0 and 12 nautical miles in December 2013. The purpose of the byelaws is to protect features in 4 Sites of Community Importance ( SCI ). More information about the sites and the features being protected: reefs (Sabellaria spinulosa) in the Inner Dowsing, Race Bank and North Ridge Site of Community Importance ( SCI ) reefs (Sabellaria spinulosa) in the Haisborough, Hammond and Winterton SCI reefs (bedrock) in the Start Point to Plymouth Sound and Eddystone SCI reefs (bedrock) in the Land’s End and Cape Bank SCI In the Start Point to Plymouth Sound and Eddystone SCI , the MMO byelaws applies between 6 and 12 nautical miles from the coast, Cornwall Inshore Fishery and Conservation Authority (IFCA) and Devon and Severn IFCA between the remaining portion of the site from 0 and 6 nautical miles. In the Land’s End and Cape Bank EMS , the MMO byelaw applies to the Cape Bank portion of the site which lies between 0 and 12 nautical miles, Cornwall IFCA has implemented a byelaw which applies to the Land’s End portion of the site between 0 and 6 nautical miles. Draft byelaws We are currently consulting on a new byelaw for Margate and Long Sands EMS . You can read the draft byelaw and associated documents below and take part in the consultation . !@1 !@2 !@3 What MMO byelaws can protect MMO byelaws can prohibit or restrict: entry to a site, movement or other activity by people, animals, vessels or vehicles vessel speed vessel anchoring killing, taking, destroying or disturbing any animals or plants anything that interferes with the seabed or damages or disturbs any object in the sea specific activities in certain parts of the site specific activities in certain periods of a year certain methods of activity within a site A MMO byelaw will apply to everyone, including other member states that hold fishing access rights in the site or its specified areas. Byelaws can also be used to restrict activities on the seashore. A MMO byelaw will include: the law that allows the byelaw to be made details (including coordinates) of the site or specified areas details of the activity being prohibited or restricted details of possible permits – like a scientific exemption the conservation objectives of the site with background information about the byelaw possibly included in an explanatory note It can take 12 months to make a permanent byelaw, from the need being identified to the byelaw being made. An emergency byelaw can be put in place if MMO considers there to be an urgent need to protect a feature of the site. MMO issues permits that authorise anything that would otherwise be unlawful under the byelaw. Permits may not be available for a specific byelaw. MMO will review all byelaws and amend or withdraw those found to be no longer needed. A review could be started sooner than originally planned if information that it was not effective or there was a change in the situation was received. The review will decide to keep, amend, replace, withdraw the byelaw, or replace a different management measure. Penalties for breaching a byelaw are based on the offence rather than for each species or habitat that is damaged. MMO permanent byelaw-making process An activity is identified that harms an EMS or MCZ . Agree objectives for potential management options, detailed within an Impact Assessment. Assess the best management options (includes input from stakeholders). If a byelaw is considered the most appropriate action, carry out a public consultation assessed management options and draft byelaw. If a byelaw is not considered the most appropriate action, consider other management options. After consultation, if a byelaw is considered the most appropriate action, make and advertise the byelaw. If a byelaw is not considered the most appropriate action, consider other management options. Review byelaw to assess effectiveness (includes input from stakeholders). If the byelaw is considered to be effective a review date is set. If the byelaw is considered ineffective, return to step 2 to consider new objectives. Emergency byelaws MMO may introduce an emergency byelaw when there is an urgent need to protect a feature. This is based on evidence about the level of damage and risk to the site. Emergency byelaws come into force without being confirmed by the Secretary of State, do not require public consultation, and take about 6 weeks to make. The Secretary of State may withdraw an emergency byelaw at any time. An emergency byelaw must be replaced by a permanent byelaw after 12 months, unless extended with agreement from the Secretary of State by a maximum of 6 months, or withdrawn if it is no longer needed. Interim byelaws Interim byelaws follow the same procedure as emergency byelaws. MMO can introduce a byelaw to protect an area being considered as a MCZ only. Further information MMO ’s byelaw powers come from: Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009 – section 129 Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010 – section 38 More details about marine protected areas in the strategic management table . Inshore fisheries and conservation authorities (IFCA) The 10 IFCA’s are responsible for making fisheries byelaws within their districts – from 0 to 6 nautical miles. MMO quality assures all IFCA byelaws. MMO help draft byelaws to ensure sustainability and to protect sensitive features in marine protected areas as well as fisheries activities within their districts. MMO has a duty to help IFCAs review sea fisheries committee legacy byelaws, by April 2015. IFCA byelaws help achieve specific protections that each IFCA district may require to: prohibit or restrict certain fishing activities introduce a permit scheme to control fishing activity or the level of fishing effort within a specific area protect certain fisheries resources or to monitor stock MMO can make byelaws to manage fishing activity within an IFCA district. MMO works with the IFCAs to agree how to manage these sites that cross the 6-nautical mile boundary. Either an IFCA makes a byelaw within 6 nautical miles and MMO makes a byelaw outside of 6 nautical miles, or MMO makes a byelaw for the whole site. Activities that may harm protected features Natural England identifies and reviews activities that may harm sites and protected features. Regional project groups also identify possible byelaws when selecting the protected sites. It is possible for management options are suggested by other sources as well, like: MMO coastal officers fishermen’s associations IFCAs harbour masters EMS officers coastal forums MMO investigates management options for a specific site and activity when evidence shows a risk of damage to the protected features by the activity. MMO will: develop an impact assessment gather evidence engage with interested parties MMO is able to make a byelaw to restrict activities that affect features not listed as part of a site if there is evidence to prove that it will further the conservation objectives. MMO can also make a byelaw if a feature is particularly rare and vulnerable. Contact information Marine Conservation and Enforcement 0300 123 1032 conservation@marinemanagement.org.uk"

/government/news/fisherman-fined-1255-for-fisheries-offences-in-case-brought-by-mmo,"Owner and master of under 10 metre vessel pleads guilty to fisheries offences. Fisherman fined £1,255 for fisheries offences in case brought by MMO  Marine Management Organisation On 12 October 2016 Richard Matthews (owner and master of the under 10 metre vessel the Anna Gail) pleaded guilty of fisheries offences at Norwich Magistrates Court. The court heard how, on 26 October 2015, an inspection of Mr Matthews’ catch was carried out by officers from the MMO and Eastern Inshore Fisheries and Conservation Authority (EIFCA) during which an offence under the Fisheries Act 1981 were detected. Mr Matthews’ catch of lobsters was inspected and measured and found to be above the minimum size and in accordance with the relevant legislation. However, after Mr Matthews left the area a further two concealed boxes were detected on his vessel, each containing lobsters which were found to be under the minimum landing size. When Mr Matthews returned to the vessel later in the day the officers approached him about the concealed lobster boxes. They instructed Mr Matthews that they wanted to inspect the additional boxes, at which point he got into his motor vehicle with the boxes and tried to make off from scene. The vehicle became stuck in the shingle beach and he then alighted, made off down the beach with the lobsters and attempted to dispose of the contents of the boxes back into the sea. It is a criminal offence under the Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009 to fail to comply with a request made by a marine enforcement officer. Mr Matthews pleaded guilty at the first opportunity and the court sentenced him to a 12 month conditional discharge, meaning that if any further offences are committed in that period the court can resentence these offences. He was ordered to pay the costs of bringing the case in full, totaling £1,255,and a victim surcharge of £15. A spokesman for the MMO said: “The fact that this case was pursued through to prosecution by the MMO sends out a strong, clear message that failure to comply with a requirement or direction reasonably made by an officer will be treated with the upmost seriousness by the MMO”."

Manage your fishing effort: Western Waters crabs and scallops  Marine Management Organisation Western Water crabs Western Waters ( ICES Area VII) 2016 edible and Spider Crab effort annual limit Defra and MMO officials met with a number of industry representatives with an interest in the area VII crab fishery on 11 November 2015 to discuss a management approach for the fishery during 2016 in line with the Western Waters regime. At this meeting, various management options were considered to ensure that the industry does not exceed the effort limit allocated to the UK under the Western Waters regime. It was decided that days at sea limits will be set for vessels operating in this area for the full 2016 year. This will be enforced via a license variation. The 190 day limit will be applicable to all over 15 metre vessels with a shellfish entitlement operating in area VII and targeting crabs under the Western Waters regime. The MMO will actively monitor days at sea uptake by vessels and review discussions will take place later in 2016 to evaluate uptake to date and discuss the management approach for the remainder of 2016. If the UK looks like it will exceed effort limits prior to 31 December 2016 as set by the Commission, then fisheries administrations will be required to close the area VII crab fishery to over 15 metre vessels for the remainder of the year in line with the Western Waters regime. The days at sea limit from 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2016 is 250 days.

On electronic logbooks, these trips should be coded with a departure message of ‘Other’ (OTH), with a comment stating that you are going to inspect your fishing gear. This will allow MMO to make vessel monitoring system data with gear inspections consistent with one another. No landings must be made during these trips. This will ensure that we do not include these trips in effort uptake calculations.

This follows two very serious incidents over the past 2 days involving people who have entered the sea in rough conditions. A police spokesperson said: There are people who enjoy swimming in all weathers as well as those who may underestimate the danger a rough sea can pose. During the current bad weather, we would like to appeal to people not to put themselves, and emergency personnel who might have to turn out to rescue them, in unnecessary danger. HM Coastguard advises that those who enjoy walking on beaches and rocky areas stay away from the surf line during this period of extreme weather and ensure that children and pets do likewise. Large waves can easily take people by surprise and the force of the waves is significant. Dogs should be kept on leads if walking along cliff tops. In an emergency at the coast, do not put yourself in danger by entering the water or climbing cliffs but call 999 and request the Coastguard. [Contact:1507]"

/government/news/ten-foreign-flagged-ships-under-detention-in-the-uk-during-december-2013,"Ten flagged ships were under detention in UK ports in December 2013 after failing port state control inspection. Ten foreign flagged ships under detention in the UK during December 2013  Maritime and Coastguard Agency The Maritime and Coastguard Agency ( MCA ) announced today (14 January 2014) that 10 flagged ships were under detention in UK ports during December 2013 after failing port state control ( PSC ) inspection. Latest monthly figures show that there were 6 new detentions of foreign flagged vessels in UK ports and 4 vessels remained under detention from previous months. Only 5 vessels remain under detention at the end of this month. In response to one of the recommendations of Lord Donaldson’s Inquiry into the prevention of pollution from merchant shipping and in compliance with the EU directive on port state control (2009/16/EC as amended), the Maritime and Coastguard agency ( MCA ) publishes details of the foreign flagged vessels detained in UK ports each month. The UK is part of a regional agreement on port state control known as the Paris Memorandum of Understanding on port state control (Paris MOU) and information on all ships that are inspected is held centrally in an electronic database known as Thetis. This allows the ships of flags with poor detention records to be targeted for future inspection. Inspections of foreign flagged ships in UK ports are undertaken by surveyors from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. When a ship is found to be not in compliance with applicable convention requirements, a deficiency may be raised.

/government/news/charity-fined-for-flouting-safety-laws,"Beauchamp Lodge Settlement has been fined after operating a passenger vessel in London without a valid passenger certificate. Charity fined for flouting safety laws  Maritime and Coastguard Agency The charity Beauchamp Lodge Settlement has been ordered to pay £3,330 in fines and costs after pleading guilty to operating a passenger vessel in London without a valid passenger certificate. The vessel ‘Beauchamp’ is a barge operated by the charity as a floating classroom for children and young people. It can also be hired for events, such as parties and weddings, and is capable of carrying up to 80 passengers as it travels along the Grand Union Canal. On 3 July, 2013, a Maritime and Coastguard Agency surveyor attended the vessel to conduct a survey and established that it had been operating since 26 January, 2013, without a valid passenger certificate, authorising its use as a passenger vessel. The vessel had been used 67 times without a certificate, carrying young children on a number of occasions. A number of defects were found on the vessel when checked by the surveyor. When interviewed, Simon Ryder, Chief Executive of the charity, admitted the vessel had been used without the certificate being in place. He was profoundly sorry for the situation, which he stated was an oversight by management, something that would not be repeated. Mr Ryder appeared before Highbury Corner Magistrates’ Court today (Thursday, 16 January) representing the charity, where he pleaded guilty on behalf of the charity. In sentencing, the Court took into consideration his full cooperation with the Maritime and Coastguard Agency in this matter, as well as his early guilty plea. The charity was fined £300, ordered to pay costs of £3,000, along with a victim surcharge of £30. In summing up, the District Judge said: You did pose a real risk to passengers. The fact you are a charity does not exempt you from your obligations Maritime and Coastguard Agency Surveyor Robert Shaw said: It is essential that vessels used for the carriage of passengers are in a fit state to do so and carry the correct emergency equipment. Passenger vessel certification is the means by which such vessels are checked for safety. Operators have a duty to their passengers to ensure they operate safe vessels that have a valid passenger certificate. [Contact:1507]"
/government/news/four-fishermen-plucked-from-liferaft-after-boat-sinks,"Fishermen rescued after sinking of vessel the 'Rachel Jayne III'.  Four fishermen plucked from liferaft after boat sinks  Maritime and Coastguard Agency Four fishermen were rescued from a liferaft by the RAF rescue helicopter based at RAF Boulmer after their 18 metre fishing vessel ‘Rachel Jayne III’ began to sink. At just before 5pm the fishing vessel ‘Kiroan’ contacted Humber Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre to say that they had heard the fishing vessel ‘Rachel Jayne III’ make a Mayday broadcast. The ‘Rachel Jayne’ had said that she was taking on water and sinking 26 miles East North East of the Tynemouth Piers. The crew were also reported to be abandoning the vessel to their liferaft. Humber Coastguard immediately sent the RAF rescue helicopter based at RAF Boulmer and the RNLI lifeboat based at Tynemouth to the scene. They also broadcast a Mayday alert message to vessels in the area requesting them to head for the scene. A large number of fishing vessels and commercial ships responded and headed towards the ‘Rachel Jayne III’. The 4 crew were winched from the liferaft to the helicopter and taken to the Wansbeck Hospital where they were met by the Newbiggin Coastguard Rescue Team and are receiving medical attention. Mike Puplett Humber Coastguard Watch Manager said: The Rachel Jayne III was listing badly when the crew took to the liferaft, and has since sunk. This was a well-known Maryport registered prawn fishing boat with an experienced crew. This evening’s incident just goes to show that you should always be prepared for the unexpected. [Contact:1507]"

/government/news/survey-and-inspection-keeping-you-safe-on-the-water,"Last year in the south west, 184 safety inspections were conducted on domestic passenger boats. Survey and inspection: keeping you safe on the water  Maritime and Coastguard Agency One hundred and eighty four safety inspections were carried out on domestic passenger boats in the south west last year. Survey and inspections are carried out to ensure that vessels are safe to set sail. Any structural defect, issue with communications or lifesaving equipment on board could mean the difference between life and death on the water. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency ( MCA ) surveyors that carry out these inspections are trained to spot any issues, and are on hand to offer advice. In the most serious of cases, the MCA can detain vessels to stop them from sailing, until the necessary improvements are made. Tony Heslop, Survey and Inspection Operations Manager for the South West, said: The majority of owners and operators of passenger boats in the west country are responsible. They work closely with us to ensure their vessels are in good working order and in turn look after the safety of their customers. In all, we look after around 700 vessels in the south west, carrying out surveys and inspections all year round as part of our work to save lives and improve safety. Nick Dunn, from Dartmouth Steam Railway and River Boat Company, one of the operators the MCA work closely with, said: We find the MCA in the south west to be particularly helpful; they have a good understanding of our business and are ready with sound help and advice. They provide an independent check on our equipment and crews, enabling us to operate with confidence and give our passengers an enjoyable and safe day out. Notes to editors There is a filming and interview opportunity to attend a survey of the last remaining coal-fired paddle steamer in the UK, the Kingswear Castle, operated by Dartmouth Steam Railway and River Boat Company. This will take place at the boatyard on the north side of Old Mill Creek, Dartmouth at 11am on Wednesday 22 January 2014.

When the teams on scene couldn’t find the teenager further investigations revealed that he was at home. He had posted his intention to jump from the Pier on social media after taking part in a ‘game’ of NekNominate this afternoon. Humber Coastguard Watch Manager Bev Allen said; The craze of neknominate is spreading virally through Facebook but before accepting your mission please just stop and think about what you are doing. If you have been drinking, your judgement will be impaired and you will be more likely to be overcome by the cold, dark sea. Your acceptance of the dare is highly likely to be life threatening. Alcohol is a contributory factor in a significant number of coastal drownings every year. Alcohol and sea water really don’t mix.

/government/speeches/search-and-rescue-interim-contract,"Outlines plans to ensure the continuation of search and rescue helicopter services from Portland, Lee on Solent, Shetland and Isle of Lewis. Search and rescue interim contract  Maritime and Coastguard Agency Department for Transport On 8 February I informed the House that, owing to irregularities in the bidding process, the government had concluded that it was not appropriate to proceed with the previously planned joint MOD / DfT PFI procurement for future search and rescue capability. The investigation into the circumstances that led to the cancellation of that procurement is ongoing. Work is also underway to identify the optimum procurement options for the long term provision of search and rescue helicopter capability for the UK. However, as the existing Maritime and Coastguard Agency search and rescue helicopter contract that provides service at Portland, Lee on Solent, Shetland and the Isle of Lewis is set to expire, I wish to inform the House of my plans to ensure that search and rescue helicopter services from these locations continue uninterrupted until new long term arrangements are in place. To ensure the continuity of services from these locations, the Department for Transport will shortly run a competition to procure an interim service for a period of up to 5 years. This contract will be similar to the arrangements that are currently in place for these bases and are working well. The contract will be open to all interested bidders able to offer a service that fully meets our requirements and ensures the safety of the public and seafarers. These arrangements will ensure that search and rescue helicopter services are maintained while the range of options in relation to the long term future provision of such services are being fully considered. The Royal Air Force and Royal Navy will continue to provide coverage from their search and rescue bases as at present, while I consider the options for the long term provision of search and rescue helicopter capability. I will inform the House later in the year of the government’s intentions for the longer term. The procurement strategy we adopt for the longer term will seek to ensure that the Ministry of Defence is able to complete its previously announced intention to withdraw its Sea Kings from service in 2016."
/government/speeches/coastguard-modernisation,"Gives details of the government's plans to modernise the coastguard in light of responses received to a consultation. Coastguard modernisation  Maritime and Coastguard Agency Department for Transport With permission Mr Speaker I wish to make a statement on the government’s intentions on taking forward the process of coastguard modernisation in the light of responses received to the consultation that ended on 5 May 2011. The key drivers behind the modernisation proposals are the need to address the limited resilience of current arrangements, distribute more effectively the workload experienced by different coastguard stations, and provide enhanced opportunities for coastguard officers to develop professional skills, with pay levels reflecting enhanced responsibilities. There is also a need to contribute to the wider deficit reduction agenda. The consultation set out proposals to create a nationally networked coastguard system with 2 maritime operations centres - 1 in the Southampton and Portsmouth area and 1 in Aberdeen - together with a 24 hour centre at Dover and 5 daytime only centres. In addition to delivering greater resilience and better career progression, the proposals identified ways of managing costs while still delivering high levels of service to seafarers and the public. It also set out our commitment to increase by 32 the number of regular coastguards to strengthen the frontline volunteer coastguard. Mr Speaker, these drivers for change remain. Our strategic objectives in this exercise remain unaltered. But throughout the consultation process I have been clear that we were willing to listen to views of the public, coastguard staff and other interested parties on the best way to deliver the outcomes we need to achieve. Over 1,800 responses were received, including many from serving coastguards. Of the total, 27 submissions suggested specific alternative solutions, all with a reduced number of stations but with differing concepts of operations. We are very grateful to all of those who responded to the consultation and to the Transport Select Committee for also looking at the issues. I can say, Mr Speaker, that this has been a model of consultation, with many serious and thoughtful responses recognising the need to deliver the overall objectives, but proposing alternative ways of doing so. There were a number of common themes that emerged from the consultation responses. These were: first, widespread acceptance, as illustrated by all the alternative solutions that were put forward, that change is necessary secondly, concerns about the potential loss of local knowledge and local contacts with volunteer coastguards and other search and rescue partners third, concerns over how the detailed concept of operations for the maritime operation centres and sub-centres would work in practice, particularly how a handover between a day time centre and a 24/7 maritime operations centre would work in practice A review of all the consultation responses has been produced under the leadership of a non-executive director of the MCA , involving a number of serving coastguard officers and members of the PCS union. This has been placed in the library of the House. A formal response from the government to the report of the Transport Select Committee will be provided separately. In the light of the consultation responses, the government has now concluded as follows: that it remains right to continue with the proposals for a nationally networked system with the introduction of 1 maritime operations centre capable of managing incidents anywhere and ensuring optimum distribution of workload across the system establishing 1 maritime operations centre, rather than the 2 previously proposed allows us to address concerns over local knowledge and the robustness of the future concept of operations by retaining one of each of the current paired stations, with the retained centres operating as part of the nationally networked system 24 hours a day rather than during daytime only - staff in each of the current pair of stations are already familiar with, and frequently experience, management of incidents in an adjacent area we have also decided that the Northern Ireland Coastguard centre at Bangor should be retained because of the specific requirement to manage the civil contingency arrangements unique to Northern Ireland and the relationship with search and rescue partners in the Irish Republic with whom we coordinate closely in air sea rescues in the waters around the island of Ireland in light of the decision to retain one station from each pair, and concerns about Welsh language communication, it has been decided to retain the Holyhead station, rather than the one at Liverpool in response to concerns expressed over the resilience of infrastructure and communication links within the Scottish Islands and with the Scottish mainland, we have decided to retain coastguard centres in both Stornoway and Shetland that in the light of a further review of the potential costs of vacating the existing sites in Swansea and Milford Haven, which has shown that there are no financial reasons to favour either location, and in view of my department’s already very substantial levels of employment in Swansea, we have decided that we should retain the coastguard centre at Milford Haven rather than the centre at Swansea In summary, subject to consultation on the changes to the previously announced approach, we will now proceed with the creation of a modernised coastguard service providing a nationally networked system comprising: one maritime operations centre in the Southampton and Portsmouth area with a disaster recovery back-up facility at the Dover station, which will retain its responsibilities for the Channel Navigation Information Service and will also serve as a sub-centre a further 8 sub-centres, all operated on a 24 hour basis, located at Falmouth, Milford Haven, Holyhead, Belfast, Stornoway, Shetland, Aberdeen and Humber The stations at Clyde, Forth, Portland, Liverpool, Yarmouth, Brixham, Thames and Swansea will close progressively over the period 2012 to 2014/2015. The station at Solent will be replaced by a new maritime operations centre in the Portsmouth and Southampton area and the small station at London is unaffected by these proposals. These revised proposals will deliver the modernisation required and are capable of delivering the same level of savings in the longer term as our previous proposals. They are right for the future of the coastguard service. I recognise, of course, that they will nonetheless represent a huge disappointment to honourable members whose constituencies are affected by the proposed closures. The additional costs generated by retaining a total of ten centres overall (plus London), all operating on a 24 hour basis, and the higher coastguard numbers that will be needed to do so, will be offset by operating only one maritime operations centre in the Southampton and Portsmouth area, with a back-up centre, equipped but not staffed, at Dover. By moving to more efficient watch patterns we will still be able to offer higher pay across the service to reflect higher levels of responsibility, while ensuring that costs overall remain within our planned funding for the coastguard as a whole. The changes to the original consultation proposal that I have announced today (14 July 2011) will be the subject of a further period of consultation. This will run for 12 weeks from today (14 July 2011), ending on 6 October 2011. Specifically, this includes the decision to retain Holyhead rather than Liverpool; the choice of Milford Haven rather than Swansea; the decision to retain stations at Shetland and Stornoway; and the decision to operate a single maritime operations centre, rather than 2. These changes to our original proposals will deliver the modernised and more cost effective service we need for the 21st century while also responding to the genuine concerns raised during the consultation process and I commend them to the House."

Canal boat company fined after operating unlicensed vessels  Maritime and Coastguard Agency A senior director of a canal boat company has today (14 March 2014) been ordered to pay £3,600 in fines and costs after pleading guilty to operating passenger vessels in North Yorkshire without valid passenger certificates. Ian Clarke, and the company Pennine Cruisers Ltd, pleaded guilty to 4 charges. Canal boats ‘Sam’ and ‘Leo’ operate on a section of the Leeds to Liverpool canal at Skipton and are authorised to carry no more than 12 passengers. Carrying more than 12 passengers would require the vessels to be surveyed and issued with passenger certificates if they met the required safety standards. On 31 July 2013 a Maritime and Coastguard Agency ( MCA ) surveyor saw ‘Leo’ being operated with 13 passengers on board and the company was spoken to. ‘Sam’ was filmed operating with 13 passengers on board on 2 August 2013 while under the control of Mr Clarke. These incidents occurred after the company had received several warnings from the MCA about carrying excess passengers. When interviewed, Mr Clarke admitted the vessels had been used without the appropriate certificates. He also admitted this was after the company had been warned against it. He was sorry for the situation, which he said was not done deliberately. In sentencing today (14 March 2014) at Skipton Magistrates’ Court, Mr Clarke’s full cooperation with the MCA as well as his early guilty plea was taken into account. However, in summing up, the magistrate said: You run a business carrying members of the public. You have exceeded your certificate and put the public at risk. MCA surveyor Adam Jackson said: Commercially operated vessels must be authorised to carry the number of passengers they are found to be carrying. Where necessary, this would be following a survey to ensure the vessels are suitable and have the necessary safety equipment on board – as would be required in this case. Operators have a duty to their passengers to ensure they run safe vessels that have a valid passenger certificate. Details of the fines and costs: Ian Clarke was fined £500 for both offences, made to pay £2,500 in costs plus a £100 surcharge. There was no separate penalty for the company. [Contact:1507]"

Crew rescued from a sinking cargo vessel  Maritime and Coastguard Agency Falmouth Coastguard has been assisting a cargo vessel which had 6 people on board and began sinking 12 miles east of the Lizard this morning. Lizard and Falmouth RNLI Lifeboats and a rescue helicopter from RNAS Culdrose attempted to pump water out of vessel, the ‘Sea Breeze’, with their own pumps. Other merchant vessels, who heard the mayday relay broadcast from Falmouth Coastguard, also stood by in case they were required. Alex Greig, Falmouth Coastguard Watch Manager says: We received the mayday broadcast from the ‘Sea Breeze’ at 7.00am and were able to get lifeboats and the helicopter on scene quickly, along with other vessels that were in the vicinity. The lifeboats and helicopter pumped water off the cargo vessel, whilst HMS Tyne was on its way with commercial pumps. However, unfortunately, the smaller pumps could not keep up with the ingress of water and the crew had to abandon ship at 8.40am. Five of the crew are now safely ashore. A couple of them have minor injuries. The captain has remained on scene on board HMS Tyne to help with the salvage operation. Additional information The Sea Breeze is an 87-metre Barbados flagged cargo vessel with 6 crew onboard. It is carrying 2,750 tons of limestone and was bound for Shoreham at the time of the incident.

Operator fined after cargo ship crashes into Farne Islands  Maritime and Coastguard Agency The operator of a coaster ship which grounded in an environmentally sensitive area off the Northumberland coast has been ordered to pay nearly £73,000 in fines and costs after its crew failed to keep a proper lookout. On the evening of 15 March 2013, the MV Danio left Perth, in Scotland, with a cargo of logs, destined for Ghent, in Belgium. The master was on watch until around midnight when he handed over to the chief officer, who had contracted an eye infection after handling a previous ‘dusty’ cargo. After coming on watch the chief officer’s eyes became increasingly irritable, so he sat on a settee, put his head back, and administered some prescription eye drops. He then inadvertently fell asleep. He was woken up 90 minutes later by the noise of the ship grounding in the early hours of 16 March. Examination of the AIS track showed that the vessel went in a straight line from the Firth of Forth until it ran aground on rocks underneath the Farne Island lighthouse. There was no lookout on watch, so the chief officer was alone on the bridge. The MV Danio crossed an outer reef before hitting a rocky shelf. It hit head on, but then pivoted about 180˚, which resulted in the whole ship becoming stuck on the rocks. The crew did not contact HM Coastguard for an hour after the incident occurred. However, they contacted the vessel’s owners within that time. The vessel was finally removed on 28 March 2013, when tidal conditions allowed it to be refloated and it was towed to Blyth for inspection. At a hearing today (27 March 2014) at Newcastle Crown Court, the operator of the MV Danio, Cuxship Management GmbH , of Cuxhaven, Germany, was fined £60,000 and ordered to pay costs of £12,796.77, along with a victim surcharge of £120, after pleading guilty to a breach of UK maritime legislation. HH Judge Brian Forster said: It is clear to me the shocking failure to comply with regulations led the vessel to sail on automatically. The potential for disaster was obvious, as it sailed on silently at night, with no lookout, with the threat to other vessels at sea. Alan Thomson, surveyor in charge at the Maritime and Coastguard Agency’s Tyne marine office, said: It was very fortunate that the damage to the MV Danio was relatively small and that there were no injuries or deaths. It is also fortunate that the effects on such an environmentally sensitive area as the Farne Islands were minimal. The requirement to keep a good lookout is set out in UK, national and international legislation. All owners and operators are reminded to ensure that their vessels are being operated and manned correctly An MP3 audio interview with MCA Enforcement Officer Captain Andy Phillips is available on request.

Humber Coastguard was first contacted by the ‘Nauru’ just after 9.30am this morning (28 March 2014) following an engine and electrical failure. The RNLI all-weather lifeboat from Wells was sent to assist and stood by to help while the crew tried to restart the engine. When they couldn’t get it going, the decision was made to tow them into Wells Harbour where repairs could be carried out. Mike Green, Watch Manager with Humber Coastguard, said: “The 15 metre boat had left Harwich, and was heading for Scarborough. It appears that this is the first time the two on board had taken the boat out. “It seems that they didn’t have a passage plan, and were seeking assistance for their onward voyage. However it transpired that the best option was to bring the vessel into Wells. “The crew reacted to their dilemma in the best possible way by seeking the assistance of the Coastguard promptly, before the situation deteriorated. “The vessel is now safely moored in Wells Harbour awaiting repairs.” [Contact:1507]"

At 4.30 this afternoon (30 March 2014), a man contacted Swansea Coastguard to report that he was concerned for the safety of 2 people who appeared to be cut off by the tide at Cefn Sidan Sands, near Burry Port. Burry Port RNLI inshore lifeboat was requested to launch, the Burry Port Coastguard Rescue Team attended and a rescue helicopter was scrambled. The 2 people were quickly located and recovered from the water by lifeboat. One of them was taken back to the lifeboat boathouse, whilst the second person, who was in a serious condition, was airlifted to hospital. In 2 other incidents, 2 groups of people were cut off on Mumbles Middlehead Island and Sully Island. In both cases the people had walked along a causeway to the island and had misjudged the time that it would take to get back. Mumbles RNLI lifeboat picked up 3 people from Mumbles Middlehead Island and Penarth RNLI inshore lifeboat picked up 2 people from Sully Island and were met at the shore by Penarth Coastguard Rescue Team.

Discussions facilitated by the minister over how the port should best be run have resulted in a major step forward, with Mr Hammond setting out a plan that will enable the community and port to work together effectively, providing a catalyst for regeneration which will benefit the port, the people who use it, and the town of Dover. Stephen Hammond said: Dover is a thriving port with a proud history and today (9 April 2014) I have set out changes to the port’s constitution and financial powers that will help it grow in the future, and put the community at the heart of decision-making at the port. I believe these steps are what is needed to secure a shared and enduring future for the port. I now urge the town and the port to work together to deliver its full potential. The agreed plan for the way forward will give greater community involvement in the strategic leadership of the port, with community non-executive directors being added to the board. It will also give the harbour board greater financial powers, to provide it with flexibility by allowing it to enter joint ventures and borrow against its assets. These changes will allow the board to raise substantial funds to invest in the future. The investment this will help deliver should bring real benefits to the port, its customers and the local community. [Contact:1016]"
/government/news/diving-incidents-drop-to-lowest-level-in-2-decades,"Latest figures reveal that the number of diving incidents has fallen to the lowest level in 21 years. Diving incidents drop to lowest level in 2 decades  Maritime and Coastguard Agency The number of diving incidents has fallen to its lowest level in 21 years, according to the latest figures from the Coastguard. There were 136 incidents in 2013, which included 10 fatalities. The most common incident was decompression illness, with 44 cases recorded last year. A further 21 incidents were down to rapid ascent, which is likely to have developed into decompression illness. Other calls in 2013 included lost and / or missing divers, broken down vessels and divers with other medical problems. Now with the Easter holidays approaching, divers are once again being reminded of essential safety advice. Ken Bazeley, the Coastguard’s National Diving Liaison Officer, said: The number of diving incidents has fallen to their lowest level since 1992, but still last year we saw 10 diving fatalities. We will continue to strive for a reduction in fatalities and serious injury. The key message for divers is to remember to make a slow ascent, perform a safety stop and have sufficient air/gas for the dive, with enough in reserve. We hope divers make use of the upcoming Easter break to get out and explore the rich marine life around our coasts, but please dive within your limits. [Contact:1507] Background information Decompression illness is when bubbles form in the blood or body tissue, and it can be fatal. It often occurs when divers surface too quickly, and symptoms include dizziness, blurring of vision, numbness and shortness of breath. Annual figures: 2010: 230 incidents, 11 fatalities 2011: 196 incidents, 14 fatalities 2012: 177 incidents, 16 fatalities 2013: 136 incidents, 10 fatalities These statistics relate to only those in which HM Coastguard coordinated the search for and rescue of those involved. National diving statistics, including both open water and inland diving together with detailed analysis, are available from the BSAC , which is the national governing body for UK sport diving.

Personal locator beacon triggers Lyme Bay Rescue  Maritime and Coastguard Agency Portland Coastguard first had contact with the vessel Sole Trader at 8:00 on Friday 18 April for a radio check on departure from Weymouth Harbour. At 11:55 on that day the Coastguard received a 406 MHz distress signal from a beacon in the Lyme Bay area and the Coastguard rescue helicopter from Portland and Sennen RNLI lifeboat were on scene within 30 minutes. On arrival, it was apparent that the vessel had been taken out for sea trials with a new engine, which had stopped working. The crew had made a VHF radio broadcast and also a VHF DSC distress call but due their distance offshore shore and being relatively low in the water these broadcasts were not picked up by anyone in the area so they activated the PLB. The Sole Trader was safely escorted back to shore. During the search, Coastguards were able to access the vessel details and speak to a shore contact because the beacon was correctly registered. The owner’s wife confirmed that he and another man, both from Bristol were out in the vessel in the Lyme Bay area. Malcolm Wright at Portland Coastguard who coordinated the rescue today says, The men on this vessel had the right communications equipment but were simply too far from shore to raise the alarm using VHF radio. Fortunately they also had a PLB which they then activated and got help quickly. Without the beacon, nobody would have known that they were in difficulty until tonight when they would have been reported overdue.” -Ends- [Contact:1507]"

/government/news/ship-operator-fined-after-oil-pollution,"The operator of a UK registered container ship has been ordered to pay £17,311.01 for breaching oil pollution legislation.     Ship operator fined after oil pollution  Maritime and Coastguard Agency The Ever Sigma – operated by Evergreen Marine – was en route from Greece to the Netherlands when 700 litres of heavy fuel oil went overboard. The incident occurred when the chief engineer decided to carry out an internal transfer of heavy fuel oil using 2 pumps. The heavy fuel oil was not pre-heated prior to the transfer – and the vessel’s master was not informed. A precautionary alarm sounded when the tank reached 336 tonnes (69% full). However, the use of 2 pumps continued for another hour when the transfer was stopped when the fuel level reached 417 tonnes (85% full). Shortly afterwards, the ship’s bosun – a senior crewman of the deck – was doing rounds when he noticed heavy fuel oil spilling onto the deck through an air pipe. The alarm was raised and clean-up operations on board began. This took about 9 hours. Unfortunately, some heavy fuel oil spilt overboard about 83 miles off Kalamata in Greece. About 27 hours after the spill occurred, the Ever Sigma reported the incident to the Italian authorities. The ship was advised by the Italian Coastguard to report the incident to Greece. This was done. On arrival in Rotterdam, the vessel was inspected by Dutch officials who conducted their own investigation. Information was passed to the UK as flag state to ultimately deal with the matter. By pumping cold heavy fuel oil with two pumps, the ship’s staff had over-pressurised the tank, which then forced it out through an air pipe. There was also a breakdown in the ship’s safety management system and procedures were not followed during the incident, which occurred on 24 January, 2013. The operator was fined £10,000, plus costs of £7,191.01, and a victim surcharge of £120 after pleading guilty to a breach of oil pollution legislation. In passing sentence at yesterday’s (29 April 2014) hearing at Southampton Magistrates’ Court, Chairman of the Magistrates’ Bench Mr Patz said: “If the heavy fuel oil hadn’t been seen by the bosun, the incident could have been much worse. “The delay in reporting the incident was also unacceptable.” The operator’s early guilty plea, cooperation with the authorities, and previous good character was commended in court. Jonathan Simpson, Head of Environmental Policy at the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA), said: “When carrying out routine internal transfers of fuel it is essential that ships follow procedures set in their safety management system – they have been put in place for a reason. “Also, if a spill does occur, it should be reported promptly to the local authorities. “The MCA would like to thank the Greek and Dutch authorities for their assistance in this matter.” [Contact:1507]"

Solent Coastguard immediately telephoned the woman who was stuck in the water with her dog. The water was already up to her waist, and, due to thick fog, she was disoriented. The Bembridge Coastguard Rescue Team, trained in water rescue, and 2 boats from Ryde Inshore Rescue were sent to the scene. Due to the foggy conditions, it wasn’t clear exactly where the woman was.

Karen Bosman, Watch Manager at Solent Coastguard, says: This woman told us she often takes her dog for a walk on the beach in this area, but this morning she was not aware of the rising spring tide. Combined with the foggy conditions, she ended up getting stuck up to her waist in the water. This must have been a terrifying ordeal and we’re grateful that we managed to recover her in time.

/government/speeches/maritime-security-in-complex-environments,"Progress has been made in improving UK maritime security through strong working partnerships between the maritime sector and government. Maritime security in complex environments  Maritime and Coastguard Agency Ministry of Defence Home Office Department for Transport Thank you for that kind introduction. And thank you to the Security in Complex Environments Group ( SCEG ) for inviting me to speak to you today (14 May 2014) at your annual conference again this year. When we met last year I said that operating at sea is perhaps the most complex and challenging environment of all. People and firms face challenges as variable as the weather. Legal, security and political issues on a daily basis that can be as unpredictable and complex as the sea itself. As an island nation we rely on the shipping industry everyday and in everything we do from the food on our plates to the energy needed to light and heat our homes and for our economic prosperity. So the work of the members of the Security in Complex Environments Group at sea is absolutely vital and I’d like to take this opportunity to thank you for your contribution over the past year. Because, in preparing to speak to you today I had a look back over what I spoke about when we met last time. The 2 words that struck me looking back at what has been achieved over the past year are ‘progress’ and ‘partnership’. I think on many of the challenges we discussed we are making progress. And that where this is happening it is based on a genuine partnership between industry and government. So I’d like to just mention a few areas of particular relevance today. One of the most visible threats the shipping industry faces is piracy – a threat which the Prime Minster has described as ‘a complete stain on our world’. There’s the financial cost to industry but, perhaps more importantly, the human cost to those who suffer from an attack. In 2010 47 vessels were hijacked in the waters off the Coast of Somalia. 174 attacks took place that year and 176 the following year. I am proud the UK is at the centre of the international effort to combat this threat. And – together – we are making progress. There have been no successful hijackings for well over a year. However, as you know, there is no room for complacency here. While the capacity is there and the will remains on the part of the pirate action groups. Our resolution must continue to be its equal. So we will continue to support the 3 pronged approach: the work of the naval forces in the region industry’s use of best management practices the use of high quality armed guards where necessary and appropriate Together with work on the ground in Somalia to promote and increase stability. The Department for Transport armed guards policy has been in place for well over 2 years now and our focus must now be on ensuring that work is carried out to the highest possible standard. The publication of the ‘ ISO publically available specification ’ ( PAS ) 28007 marked an important step in promoting high industry standards. As you may recall, I have been an advocate of this standard from the outset because I believe that raising standards will benefit us all. It increases government’s confidence in the maritime security industry. Shipping companies have access to the high quality protection they need. And British PMSCs will continue to be the world leaders in the field, both in terms of market share and in being at the forefront of raising standards. I am delighted the past year has seen the significant progress we all hoped for. The United Kingdom Accreditation Service pilot was completed and British firms are now able to achieve accredited third party certification to the ISO PAS 28007. You as an industry have demonstrated your absolute commitment to providing your services to a high standard and it is quite right that there is global recognition of that fact. ISO have submitted a paper on the progress of the PAS to the IMO Maritime Safety Committee which takes place over 10 days starting tomorrow. That paper goes into detail about the UK pilot and highlights how the UK is at the forefront of this work. I know that supporting this industry and the work you do is not just about the big policy picture, it’s about the nuts and bolts too. Last year I assured you that we were committed to finding a resolution to the issue of floating armouries and that, the government, wanted to stand behind British industry. I think it is a testament to the strength of the partnership between the industry and the government that as of July last year British companies were able to lawfully use floating armouries flagged to states other than the UK. I hope this demonstrates my personal and the government’s commitment to the industry and the work that is being done to secure our nation’s shipping. I know that the Home Office Minister Norman Baker spoke this morning about the Home Office project piloting the use of UK flagged floating armouries. My officials are fully engaged in the pilot and will remain so and I am pleased that the Home Office has moved so swiftly to bring this forward. This is not a simple issue with a simple answer but we are not afraid to ask the questions and see what works. Last year I told you that the MCA , with the assistance of SCEG were undertaking work so that armed guards did not have to undertake training twice by completing courses required by the armed guard industry and the shipping industry. I am pleased to report that this work has been completed and armed guards who have undertaken the maritime security operatives course under the auspices of City and Guilds do not have to undertake the shipping industry person with designated security duties course when on UK ships. To further assist the armed guards industry, I also agreed with MCA that the arrangement would be circulated to all countries through the IMO . Finally, I just want to briefly mention how we are reforming the overarching strategic approach to maritime security. Yesterday I had the great privilege of taking part in the launch of the national strategy for maritime security at the UK Chamber of Shipping, speaking alongside the Minister for the Armed Forces . It is the first time the UK has had a single national strategy setting out how we will protect our vital maritime interests and I would like to thank the SCEG for your support developing the strategy. It has greatly benefitted from the experience and knowledge of many of the people in this room. One of the most important parts of the strategy is the new Industry National Maritime Security Committee. It represents a unique partnership between industry and government to improve the security of our seas. I was very pleased that the chairmanship will be held by Gavin Simmonds from the UK Chamber of Shipping. The committee has also invited Paul Gibson to represent the SCEG on the committee and I am pleased he has accepted. The SCEG is an incredibly important group and I want you to play a full part in protecting the country’s maritime interests and infrastructure. To sum up, the most important message I wanted to get across this time last year was that we were listening and we wouldn’t shy away from the hard or the difficult issues. I hope that we’ve shown over the past year progress is possible and has been made and that where we have done so, it has been in partnership. Over the coming year we will continue to listen and to talk to discuss with you about the changing challenges you face and how we can better support you. I am immensely grateful to all of you for being part of that conversation. Thank you for listening today. I look forward to working with you over the coming months to improve the security of our seas. Thank you."
/government/news/man-rescued-off-west-wales-after-boat-blaze,"A man has been rescued off the west Wales coast today (Friday 16 May 2014) following a major fire on his boat. Man rescued off west Wales after boat blaze  Maritime and Coastguard Agency The 26ft pleasure boat went up in flames 600 metres off Aberystwyth and Coastguards have been asking all vessels in the area to stay a mile away from it as a precaution. The vessel contains flares, some of which were going off at the scene, and a gas canister. The RNLI lifeboat from Aberystwyth is monitoring the situation and the Aberystwyth Coastguard Rescue Team are also on standby on the shoreline to report any possible pollution and wreckage. The RNLI Inshore lifeboat from Aberystwyth rescued the man at around 10:30am and he was taken by ambulance to hospital in the town. Roger Reed, Watch Manager at Milford Haven Coastguard, said: Resources were quickly on scene and the man isn’t believed to have suffered any serious injuries. The boat is severely ablaze and there is a lot of smoke. We have put out a security broadcast advising other vessels in the area to stay well clear of it. [Contact:1507]"
/government/news/man-escapes-from-out-of-control-speedboat-in-teignmouth,"A man has had a lucky escape after being thrown from his speedboat in Teignmouth Quay. Man escapes from out of control speedboat in Teignmouth  Maritime and Coastguard Agency Brixham Coastguard received a 999 call from a member of the public just after 10am this morning (Friday 16 May 2014), reporting that a man had been hurled into the water from his speedboat. The boat was then going round in circles and the man was trying to swim away to safety. The Teignmouth Coastguard Rescue Team and the Teignmouth RNLI inshore lifeboat were sent to the scene. The lifeboat crew managed to bring the boat under control by cutting the engine. The man had been picked up by another boat nearby and was brought ashore where he was met by Coastguard Rescue Officers. He’s since been taken to hospital to be checked over, but doesn’t appear to have been badly hurt. Andre Huber, Watch Manager at Brixham Coastguard, said: It appears the man took off his kill cord as it was too short to allow him to tie up his boat. Unfortunately, he accidentally knocked the throttle, the boat jerked forward and he fell into the water. Without the kill cord, the boat’s engine didn’t cut out and then locked into driving round and round in circles. Luckily he did have a lifejacket on and was able to quickly swim away to safety and the boat was soon brought under control. We always recommend people wear their kill cord at all times when on the boat. Make sure it’s a suitable length so you can move around your vessel, particularly if you’re on your own. As we’re set for fine weather this weekend, we’d just like to remind everyone to have fun but stay safe on our coastline. If you get into difficulty, call 999 and ask for the Coastguard, or get in touch with us via VHF channel 16.” [Contact:1507]"
/government/news/coastguard-statement-to-cheeki-rafiki-search-and-rescue-operation,"This is a statement from Her Majesty's Coastguard on the search operation for the Cheeki Rafiki, carried out by the US Coast Guard.

/government/news/yacht-trina-found-following-mayday-broadcast,"A man whose yacht had broken down was found by the RNLI Berwick Lifeboat just after midnight on Sunday 25 May. Yacht ‘Trina’ found following mayday broadcast  Maritime and Coastguard Agency Humber Coastguard was alerted by Mayday emergency call on 25 May at 12.30 am by the yacht ‘Trina’. The yacht was in difficulty 5 miles South East of Berwick Upon Tweed. There was one man on board with no reported injuries. His yacht had lost his navigation system and was partially swamped. Humber Coastguard requested the RNLI Berwick Lifeboat to attend the scene. The ship ‘Prudence’ also in the area assisted the lifeboat in locating the yacht. The lifeboat then escorted the ‘Trina’ back to Berwick. Graham Dawson, Humber Coastguard Watch Manager said, The skipper of the yacht ‘Trina’ had lost his navigation system and let off a number of emergency flares to help us locate him. Unfortunately in doing so he had set fire to his lifejacket which resulted in him having to remove it. It is always important to check your position and re-check it. We also recommend that you join and keep up to date the voluntary CG66 safety identification scheme. Finally tell someone where you are going and when you expect to return. [Contact:1507]"
/government/news/coastguard-urge-check-tide-times-before-setting-out,"Swansea Coastguard dealt with four separate incidents involving people being cut off by the rising tide at the weekend (25 May)  Coastguard urge ""check tide times before setting out""  Maritime and Coastguard Agency As the weather warms up Swansea Coastguard is urging the public to check tide times and weather conditions before setting out on coastal walks. Whilst on exercise earlier on Sunday (25 May), Burry Port RNLI lifeboat located two boys in difficulties, stranded on the rocks at Bluepool, Gower. The lifeboat landed them ashore on the beach at Broughton Bay. Swansea Coastguard then had a call concerning four members of the public cut off by the tide at Sully Island. The Penarth Coastguard Rescue Team and Penarth lifeboat transfered the casualties ashore. Watchet Coastguard Rescue Team and Minehead RNLI lifeboat were the next teams to be sent by Swansea Coastguard to assist two adults and two dogs that had become cut off by the tide near Grey Rock, Blue Anchor. They were all safely returned to the shore. Finally, on Sunday afternoon, Swansea Coastguard was contacted by the Assistant Pier Master at Penarth Pier concerning a group of people that were cut off by the tide just north of Penarth Pier. Luckily the group all managed to climb the rock armour, whilst keeping in contact on a mobile phone, and returned to safety with no assistance required. Marc Lancey, Swansea Coastguard Watch Manager said, Always check the weather and tidal conditions before you set out for beach walks so that you can prepare accordingly. At sea changes in tidal streams could make conditions worse, particularly if the wind and tide are against each other. Tidal heights may hide underwater hazards. Consider whether you could become cut off by the incoming tide, above all do not take risks. If you do get into difficulty, call 999 and ask for the Coastguard. [Contact:1507]"
/government/news/10-foreign-flagged-ships-under-detention-during-may-2014,"10 foreign flagged ships were under detention in UK ports during May 2014 after failing Port State Control (PSC) inspection.  10 foreign flagged ships under detention during May 2014  Maritime and Coastguard Agency The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) announced today that ten foreign flagged ships were under detention in UK ports during May 2014 after failing Port State Control (PSC) inspection. During May, there were four new detentions of foreign flagged vessels in UK ports. Six vessels remained under detention from previous months. Five vessels were released during May. A total of five vessels remain under detention at the end of May. 1. In response to one of the recommendations of Lord Donaldson’s Inquiry into the prevention of pollution from merchant shipping and in compliance with the EU Directive on Port State Control (2009/16/EC as amended), the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) publishes details of the foreign flagged vessels detained in UK ports each month. 2. The UK is part of a regional agreement on port state control known as the Paris Memorandum of Understanding on Port State Control (Paris MOU) and information on all ships that are inspected is held centrally in an electronic database known as Thetis. This allows the ships of flags with poor detention records to be targeted for future inspection. 3. Inspections of foreign flagged ships in UK ports are undertaken by surveyors from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. When a ship is found to be not in compliance with applicable Convention requirements, a deficiency may be raised. If the deficiency is so serious that it has to be rectified before departure, then the ship may be detained. 4. All deficiencies should be rectified before departure if at all possible. 5. When applicable, the list includes those passenger craft prevented from operating under the provisions of the EU Directive on Mandatory Surveys for the safe operation of regular Ro-Ro ferry and high speed passenger craft services (1999/35/EU). Notes on the list of detentions Full details of the ship.

/government/news/new-uk-counter-pollution-equipment-tested-in-belfast,"New high-tech equipment that can be deployed anywhere in the UK to clean up oil spills has been tested for the first time in Belfast.  New UK counter pollution equipment tested in Belfast  Maritime and Coastguard Agency The Maritime and Coastguard Agency ( MCA ) has recently purchased two new pieces of equipment known as the NOFI Current Buster 6. This is the very latest in up to date technology and was developed following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill response in 2010. The latest piece of kit can operate five times faster, as the hydrodynamic shape reduces the drag force and allows the system to move more easily through the water. This model also has debris nets, wave dampers and a splash-over cover to avoid spillages. With an oily water separator it has a temporary storage capacity of 70m2. It was put to the test in a unique demonstration in Belfast Lough on Wednesday 11 June. The MCA is often called upon to deal with a wide range of pollution incidents off the UK coast and has a detailed plan of action and equipment in place to deal with such issues. Gail Robertson, the MCA ’s Counter Pollution Resource Manager, said: The Maritime and Coastguard Agency has a thorough response procedure in place to deal with many different types of emergencies at sea that cause pollution, or threatens to cause pollution. Demonstrations like the one in Belfast Harbour today show how our equipment is fit for purpose. These two NOFI Current Buster 6 will enhance and boost our response capability around the whole of the UK. [Contact:1507]"
/government/news/man-rescued-after-going-under-dorset-ferry,"A man had a lucky escape after being thrown into the water, dragged under a ferry but surfacing on the other side. Man rescued after going under Dorset ferry  Maritime and Coastguard Agency Portland Coastguard received several 999 calls during the evening of Friday 13 June 2014 reporting that a small grey inflatable dinghy had suffered engine failure whilst in the path of the Sandbanks chain ferry. The 2 occupants were unable to start the engine in time causing it to collide with the chain ferry. The 2 men were thrown into the water, 1 going under the ferry before surfacing the other side. The chain ferry, ‘Bramblebush Bay’ plucked one of the men from its own path. The other man was rescued from the water by a passing yacht. Both Poole RNLI All Weather Lifeboat and Poole RNLI Inshore lifeboat were diverted from another job, so were able to get to the scene quickly along with Coastguard Rescue Officers from Poole. The lifeboat assisted by removing the dinghy after it had become trapped in the chains and took it ashore with one of the casualties, the other being on the ferry. Both men were wet but unharmed and soon departed carrying their deflated dinghy back to the car. Maddy Davey, Portland Coastguard Watch Manager says: The 2 men were very unfortunate that their boat broke down where and when it did. In this kind of situation quick communications are key and so a handheld vhf radio, mini flares or a mobile phone in a waterproof bag would have proved invaluable in contacting the Coastguard and requesting immediate assistance.

/government/news/father-and-son-rescued-after-boat-circles-them-for-40-minutes,"A father and son have been rescued and brought ashore after their boat broke down and their attempt to repair it went wrong. Father and son rescued after boat circles them for 40 minutes  Maritime and Coastguard Agency The angling boat was 3 nautical miles off Redcar when it broke down on Saturday afternoon (14 June 2014) and the 2 men began making attempts to repair it. As they worked on the engines, the main engine suddenly sprang into action and threw both of them into the water. The boat circled around the two men in the water (neither of whom was wearing a lifejacket) for 40 minutes before the vessel ran out of fuel. At this point the son was able to clamber back on board and broadcast a mayday message. The fishing vessel ‘Nimrod II’, the pilot vessel ‘Coatham’ and a passing warship responded to the request for assistance, whilst Humber Coastguard requested the Redcar RNLI lifeboat to launch. The Nimrod II rescued the man from the water and took him to shore, whilst the Coatham stood by to ensure safety. When the lifeboat arrived on scene, it retrieved the other man from the angling boat and took him to shore then returned to the vessel and towed it back to Redcar. Both men have been taken to hospital suffering with hypothermia. Graham Dawson, Humber Coastguard Watch Manager says: If your boat breaks down at sea, and repairing it is not a routine job, please call the Coastguard, so that we can get the resources to you to help. Wear the lifejacket or buoyancy aid that your sport’s governing body recommends. [Contact:1507]"
/government/news/colonsay-rescue-underlines-importance-of-safety-equipment,"A fisherman has had a lucky escape after his boat sank off the island of Colonsay. Colonsay rescue underlines importance of safety equipment  Maritime and Coastguard Agency Belfast Coastguard received a 999 call from a member of the public at around 10.30am on Thursday 19 June 2014. They reported seeing a man waving for help on some rocks off Port Mor. The fisherman, believed to be in his 70s, hadn’t been spotted for some time. By the time rescue teams had lifted him to safety from the remote location, he had been on the rocks for more than two hours. A Royal Navy search and rescue helicopter from Prestwick winched the man to safety, and the lifeboat from Islay also took part in the operation. A local fishing vessel, Pioneer, stood by and stayed in visual contact with the man until the rescue teams arrived. It emerged that the fisherman wasn’t wearing a life jacket and didn’t have other basic safety equipment, such as distress flares or an EPIRB which would have speeded up the rescue. Judith McNeice, Watch Manager at Belfast Coastguard, said: It is clear that this gentleman had a very lucky escape and was able to swim to rocks after his boat was wrecked. As he lacked a life jacket or buoyancy aid it might have been quite a different story if his boat had sunk further from the rocks. The fact that he lacked equipment, such as distress flares or an EPIRB to summon help immediately, meant that he was marooned on the rocks for far longer than was necessary. The fisherman’s condition was reported as uninjured but very cold, and he was returned to his home by Colonsay Coastguard Rescue Officers. [Contact:1507]"
/guidance/maritime-and-coastguard-agency-port-state-control-expanded-inspections,"What kinds of vessels get expanded inspections by the MCA, what happens during the inspections, notice, and where you can find more advice. Maritime and Coastguard Agency Port State Control expanded inspections Surveys and inspections Construction, maintenance and operation standards Maritime and Coastguard Agency Introduction The Maritime and Coastguard Agency ( MCA ) is responsible for checking that ships visiting UK ports and anchorages meet UK and international safety rules. Under a EU directive on Port State Control, the agency can inspect foreign-flagged ships calling at UK ports and anchorages. The MCA ’s Regulation 2011 S.I. No. 2601, The Merchant Shipping (Port State Control) Regulations 2011 and Merchant Shipping Notice MSN 1832 explain how the directive is incorporated into UK law. Vessels visiting EU ports are subject to periodic checks and in-depth ‘expanded inspections’. Expanded inspections are carried out on the following types of vessels due for a periodic port state inspection: vessels with a high ship risk profile, as recorded on the Paris Memorandum of Understanding database oil, gas, or chemical tankers over 12 years old bulk carriers over 12 years old passenger ships over 12 years old Masters, owners or operators of such vessels must give the MCA 72 hours’ notice, before their expected time of arrival, or before leaving the previous port or anchorage, if the voyage is expected to take less than 72 hours. This guide explains what expanded inspections involve for different types of vessels, and lists organisations that can provide further information. Vessels subject to expanded inspections The MCA carries out expanded Port State Control inspections of foreign-flagged ships calling at UK ports or anchorages, under regulations explained in the MCA ’s Regulation 2011 S.I. No. 2601, The Merchant Shipping (Port State Control) Regulations 2011 and Merchant Shipping Notice MSN 1832. Expanded Port State Control inspections are carried out on high risk ships. The basis of a vessel’s ‘ship risk profile’ determines the length of time since its last inspection and ship type and age. Ships can be classified as: high risk profile - those that have not been inspected in the Paris Memorandum of Understanding ( MoU ) region during the previous five months standard risk profile - those that have not been inspected in the Paris MoU region during the previous ten months low risk profile - those that have not been inspected in the Paris MoU region during the previous 24 months You can check the risk profile of a ship using the Paris MoU online risk calculator. Assess a vessel’s risk profile by entering data on an online database on the European Maritime Safety Agency website. Expanded inspections are also carried out on vessels over 12 years old, irrespective of their Risk Profile, in the following categories: oil tankers gas and chemical tankers bulk carriers passenger ships Ro-Ro or high-speed passenger craft do not need to undergo an expanded inspection under Port State Control. For more information, see the page in this guide reporting requirements for vessels subject to expanded inspections. See MSN 1832 New Port State Control Directive How to report requirements for vessels subject to expanded inspections If a vessel is eligible for an expanded inspection, the owners must complete the MCA ’s Expanded Inspection Ship Arrival form and send it to the MCA Marine office for its next UK port of call. Owners should send the form either 72 hours before the vessel arrives, or when it leaves its previous port if the voyage is due to last under 72 hours. Forms can be emailed or faxed to MCA offices, or to the MCA ’s headquarters via the ship’s agent. It is an offence not to report a vessel eligible for an expanded inspection, and enforcement action may be taken. Such failures to report are recorded in the Paris MoU inspection reporting system - making the vessel a priority for inspection at its next port of call within the Paris MoU region. Download a Notice of ship arrival for expanded inspection form, form MSF 1679 (PDF 84kB). For more information see the page in this guide on what an expanded inspection involves. What an expanded inspection involves Expanded inspections of vessels involve detailed checks of construction elements and safety systems by inspectors from the MCA . Inspectors must ensure that their visits do not compromise the safety of seafarers carrying out on-board operations, such as cargo handling. Areas checked during an expanded inspection All ship types are subject to expanded inspection and the following areas will be checked: structural condition watertight/weathertight condition emergency systems radio communications fire safety systems alarms living and working conditions lifesaving appliances pollution prevention measures Structural checks involve assessment of the hull and deck condition. Watertight doors, ventilators and hatchways are also inspected. Emergency system checks cover emergency lighting, as well as steering gear and bilge pumping equipment. Radio communication assessments cover areas such as main installation functioning, global maritime distress safety systems, and back-up energy sources. Fire safety tests include tests of the crew’s ability to use firefighting equipment and firemen’s outfits. Tests of fire doors, extinguisher systems, alarms, and remote stopping of ventilation and fuel pump systems are also carried out. Inspectors also check seafarer living and working conditions, such as the condition of mooring equipment, including machinery foundations. They will also review launching arrangements for survival and rescue craft and test the effectiveness of oil filtering equipment in preventing pollution. Download list of vessel items to be checked during an expanded inspection from the EUR-Lex website (PDF, 721KB). In addition to the above the following areas will also be inspected depending on ship type. Bulk carrier inspections Specific areas checked for bulk carriers and ore-bulk-oil ( OBO ) vessels - if carrying solid bulk cargo - include documentation and structural condition. Vessel owners must provide evidence that certified enhanced survey programme ( ESP ) documents are on board, including: structural survey reports thickness measurement reports condition evaluation reports approval for loading instruments documents associated with dangerous goods cargoes Structural checks of bulk carriers cover areas such as bulkheads and ballast tanks. Gas tankers and chemical tankers For these types of vessels, expanded inspection checks cover areas such as: documentation - a relevant certificate of fitness cargo operations - cargo tank monitoring and safety devices fire safety - fixed fire-fighting installations on deck living and working conditions - cabin escape sets of appropriate respiratory and eye protection gear General cargo vessels Expanded inspections also cover the following types of vessel: general cargo container refrigerated cargo carrier factory heavy load carrier offshore service special purpose mobile offshore drilling unit - known as MODU floating production, storage and offloading - known as FPSO Inspectors will assess watertight conditions - such as access to cargo holds or tanks - and cargo operations, eg lashing arrangements and loading equipment. Oil tanker and OBO vessels certificated as oil tankers The expanded inspection for oil tankers involves checks of: certified ESP documentation - structural survey reports and condition evaluation reports, such as foam certificates for deck foam systems structural condition - ballast tanks within cargo area from tank manhole or deck access fire safety - fixed deck foam systems, including gas and pressure controls Passenger vessels Checks of passenger vessels such as high-speed craft ( HSC ) and Ro-Ro ferries should cover: documentation: evidence of crowd-management and safety training watertight condition: bow and stern doors and remote operation of watertight bulkhead doors emergency systems: familiarity of crew with damage control plan cargo operation: including lashing arrangements fire safety: remote and local controls for closing fire dampers alarms: including public address and fire detection systems lifesaving appliances: the ‘abandon ship’ drill Expanded inspections can take place on Ro-Ro ferries and HSC vessels during passage to or from European Union ports, to check safety procedures are working properly. Inspectors and Port State Control officers must not cause any obstruction to the vessel’s operation. Ro-Ro cargo vessels Expanded inspections of Ro-Ro cargo vessels should cover: watertight conditions - bow and stern doors cargo operations - lashing arrangements See MSN 1832 New Port State Control Directive See MSN 1832 New Port State Control Directive for The Merchant Shipping (Port State Control) Regulations 2011.

/government/news/stuck-girl-rescued-as-tide-rises-in-aberaeron,"A 9-year-old girl has been rescued after her foot became wedged in the rocky sea defences at Aberaeron beach. Stuck girl rescued as tide rises in Aberaeron  Maritime and Coastguard Agency Milford Haven Coastguard was contacted just before 5pm on Thursday 10 July 2014 reporting that the youngster was stuck and the tide was coming in fast. The Newquay Coastguard Rescue Team, the Newquay RNLI inshore lifeboat along with police, fire and ambulance services were all sent to the scene. When the lifeboat reached the girl, she was barely visible from the surface. A crewman from the lifeboat took the immediate decision to jump into the water and get a view of what was going on. He then managed to cut her stuck wellington boot to release her. Milford Haven Coastguard Watch Manager, Roger Reed, said: This frightening incident demonstrates to all parents how quickly a fun day playing at the beach could have turned into a tragedy. It is essential that you make yourself aware of the tides and how quickly they come in. In this instance the crewman’s bravery undoubtedly saved her life. The young lady is now safe and well, but shocked by the whole event. [Contact:1507]"
/government/news/missing-yorkshire-yachtsman-found-in-north-sea,"A Yorkshire yachtsman has been found alive and well on his yacht 80 miles off the Yorkshire coast. Missing Yorkshire yachtsman found in North Sea  Maritime and Coastguard Agency A yachtsman from Yorkshire, reported missing yesterday (Thursday 10 July 2014), has been found on his yacht in the North Sea, following an extensive search coordinated by Humber Coastguard. His 17ft yacht, Equinox, was approximately 80 miles east of Spurn Point (at the mouth of the Humber) and rescuers found him relatively quickly today, thanks to an emergency positioning beacon aboard his yacht which was activated. The 69-year-old’s family contacted the Coastguard on Thursday as they had become concerned for his safety. They had not heard from him since 4 July when he telephoned his son to tell him he was planning his passage home. His boat was last seen in the Kiel Canal, at Brunsbuttel, Germany. A police investigation revealed that the missing man had not used his bank cards since 3 July, leading Coastguards to assume that he was at sea. Humber Coastguard initiated the search and rescue helicopter from RAF Leconfield to make a wide sweep of the area from Scarborough to the median line in the middle of the North Sea. Germany counterparts carried out a similar search from Helgoland. A general alert to French, Belgian, Dutch authorities and shipping was put out, and Humberside Police logged a missing person’s alert with Interpol. Humber Coastguard last night also appealed to the yachtsman directly following the BBC shipping forecast to urgently make contact and inform the Coastguard of his safety and intentions. Watch Manager at Humber Coastguard, Mike Green, said: We are all absolutely delighted that this gentleman has been found alive and well. It is thanks to an excellent effort by all those involved in the search and rescue and is a testament to the value of emergency beacon equipment. It is important that yachtsmen planning this sort of passage have adequate communications and log a passage plan with a shore contact. The more information that is available to us here at the Coastguard, the more concentrated we can make our search efforts. [Contact:1507]"
/government/news/fishing-vessel-sinks-off-stornoway,"Three men have been rescued from a life raft by the Stornoway Coastguard rescue helicopter.

Stornoway Coastguard sent the helicopter to the scene and requested the launch of Lochinver RNLI all weather lifeboat to the incident 10 miles south west of Cape Wrath. When the Stornoway Coastguard rescue helicopter arrived in the area they quickly located the vessel which was found within one mile of the distress alert position and still afloat. The three crew were alongside in a life raft and the vessel sank shortly afterwards. All three crew were winched into the aircraft and transferred to the Western Isles Hospital at Stornoway to be checked for hypothermia. [Contact:1507]"
/government/news/its-good-to-share-but-not-lifejackets,"They say it's good to share – but a rescue in the Humber proved that doesn't apply to lifejackets. It's good to share - but not lifejackets  Maritime and Coastguard Agency Humber Coastguard received a call just after 10am this morning (25 July 2014) reporting 2 people in the water after their powered canoe had capsized just west of the Humber Bridge. The Hull Coastguard Rescue Team, Humber Rescue Inshore Lifeboat and the police all attended and found one of the boat’s occupants clinging to his companion, who was the only one wearing a lifejacket. The RAF search and rescue helicopter from Leconfield lifted the very cold canoeists aboard; they were put ashore and taken to Hull Royal Infirmary, where they were confirmed as well. Humber Coastguard Watch Manager, Graham Dawson, said: Anyone taking to the water should always wear their own properly maintained life jacket or buoyancy aid. If you capsize or fall in, there is never a guarantee that you will be able to find an object to cling to. The other occupant of the canoe was fortunate that he was able to hang on to his friend while they awaited rescue, but this can quickly become exhausting – especially in cold water. [Contact:1507]"
/government/news/fishermen-rescued-from-liferaft-after-9-hours-at-sea,"2 fishermen are recovering after spending the day at sea in a liferaft. Fishermen rescued from liferaft after 9 hours at sea  Maritime and Coastguard Agency They had been fishing 12 miles east of Sunderland when their vessel appeared to hit a submerged object and sank so quickly that they were unable to make a distress call. Their liferaft floated free of their vessel, as it is designed to do, and the pair were able to climb on board. At 4.40pm on Monday 28 July 2014, the Dutch yacht ‘Jager’ came across the fishermen in their liferaft. They took the two men on board their boat and contacted Humber Coastguard to inform them of what had happened. The Coastguard requested the Hartlepool RNLI lifeboat to launch and they picked the two men up from the yacht and brought them to shore. Mike Puplett, Humber Coastguard Watch Manager, said: Both of the fishermen are now safe and well, although a little shaken by their ordeal. We’d like to thank the Dutch yacht ‘Jager’ which rescued the men and went out of their way to ensure their safety. The fishing vessel’s liferaft was a life saver and this incident highlights how important it is to ensure that liferafts are properly maintained and able to float free of the boat should the worst happen. Fishermen should wear personal flotation devices at all times whilst on deck. Even if the liferaft floats free, getting into one is no mean feat, especially if the weather is more volatile than today’s relatively calm seas. Although the liferaft has been drifting for nine hours, we are still hopeful that we will be able to find the wreckage of the boat using our search and rescue information system (SARIS) which is a computer programme that allows us to plot the drift of vessels. The MCA ’s counter pollution branch and the Marine Accident Investigation Branch have been informed. [Contact:1507]"
/government/publications/lifejacket-fatality-figures,"Lifejacket fatality statistics for the period 2007 to 2013.  Lifejacket fatality figures  Maritime and Coastguard Agency Once a year the Casualty Review Panel discusses fatal maritime incidents, and provides its opinion about whether a lifejacket or buoyancy aid might have saved a person’s life. Twelve people’s lives might have been saved in 2013 if they had been wearing a lifejacket or buoyancy aid, according to the Casualty Review Panel."
/government/news/man-rescued-from-flooded-car-on-lancashire-causeway,"A man has been rescued from his car after being swamped by the rising tide on the causeway between Overton and Sunderland Point. Man rescued from flooded car on Lancashire causeway  Maritime and Coastguard Agency Liverpool Coastguard received a 999 call from a member of the public just after midday on Tuesday 12 August 2014. They reported that a car was totally surrounded by the incoming tide and someone was trapped inside. The Morecambe and Knott End Coastguard Rescue Teams, the Morecambe RNLI inshore lifeboat, the search and rescue helicopter from RAF Valley along with fire and ambulance crews were sent to the scene. When the lifeboat crew arrived at the car, they found it was almost completely full of water. They had to smash the window to free the man inside. He was then taken to shore, and passed into the care of the ambulance crew. Graham Parr, Watch Manager at Liverpool Coastguard, said: The lifeboat crew arrived on scene just in time to grab this man from his car and take him to safety. We are on spring tides at the moment, so the water floods in at an incredibly fast pace. We always recommend that people check tide times before setting out, for any activity on the coast, particularly if you plan to drive over a causeway. During highwater, it’s likely the road will be covered with water and with it strong undercurrents. It’s just not worth the risk. If you see someone in difficulty, or if you get into problems yourself, call 999 and ask for the Coastguard. [Contact:1507]"
/government/news/man-winched-from-stricken-yacht-in-north-sea,"A man has been rescued after his yacht ran into difficulty 28 nautical miles north of Cromer. Man winched from stricken yacht in North Sea  Maritime and Coastguard Agency Humber Coastguard received a distress alert from the 22ft yacht just after 8am this morning (Monday 18 August 2014). The person on board reported that he was taking on water, his sails were in tatters and the engine had failed. The wind at the time was gusting up to 46 mph, with a 3.5 metre swell. The search and rescue helicopter from RAF Wattisham was sent to the scene, along with the RNLI ’s Cromer and Humber all-weather lifeboats. A vessel in the area at the time also went to help and stood by the yacht until rescue units arrived. The man was then winched on board the helicopter and taken to hospital to be checked over as he was showing signs of suffering from hypothermia. Graham Dawson, Watch Manager at Humber Coastguard, said: Conditions out in the North Sea so far today have been pretty treacherous, with winds gusting more than 40mph and a large swell. However, this yacht was well-equipped with all the necessary communications equipment, so when he ran into trouble he could quickly raise the alarm. He had on board a VHF digital selective calling radio, which can send a distress alert and, if linked up to GPS, an accurate position of your vessel to the Coastguard with one touch of a button.

/government/news/12-foreign-flagged-ships-under-detention-in-the-uk-during-june-2014,"12 foreign flagged ships were under detention in UK ports during June 2014 after failing Port State Control (PSC) inspection. 12 foreign flagged ships under detention in the UK during June 2014  Maritime and Coastguard Agency During June, there were 7 new detentions of foreign flagged vessels in UK ports. 5 vessels remained under detention from previous months. 6 vessels were released during June. A total of 6 vessels remained under detention at the end of June. In response to one of the recommendations of Lord Donaldson’s Inquiry into the prevention of pollution from merchant shipping and in compliance with the EU Directive on Port State Control (2009/16/EC as amended), the Maritime and Coastguard agency (MCA) publishes details of the foreign flagged vessels detained in UK ports each month. The UK is part of a regional agreement on port state control known as the Paris Memorandum of Understanding on Port State Control (Paris MOU) and information on all ships that are inspected is held centrally in an electronic database known as Thetis. This allows the ships of flags with poor detention records to be targeted for future inspection. Inspections of foreign flagged ships in UK ports are undertaken by surveyors from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. When a ship is found to be not in compliance with applicable Convention requirements, a deficiency may be raised. If the deficiency is so serious that it has to be rectified before departure, then the ship may be detained. All deficiencies should be rectified before departure if at all possible. When applicable, the list includes those passenger craft prevented from operating under the provisions of the EU Directive on Mandatory Surveys for the safe operation of regular Ro-Ro ferry and high speed passenger craft services (1999/35/EU).

He said he needed to be recovered from his life raft. Humber Coastguard requested the Hartlepool RNLI inshore and all weather lifeboats to the scene as well as the Tynemouth all weather lifeboat. The Seaham Coastguard Rescue Team was tasked and the RAF rescue helicopter from Boulmer also dispatched. Humber Coastguard also received a number of 999 calls from the public and local vessels in the area who could see the smoke plumes and the yacht on fire. Humber Coastguard Watch Manager Mark Ellis said: When we spoke to this gentleman, it was clear that he was foreign, but through broken English we were able to instruct him to discharge his personal locator beacon (PLB) which gave us an exact location. However due to the highly visible smoke on scene many vessels were already en route to assist. When the man was located he had his lifejacket on and was in his life raft.

/government/news/master-fined-after-wind-farm-collision-off-norfolk-coast,"The master of a wind farm support boat has been made to pay £3,000 in fines and costs after breaching maritime collision regulations. Master fined after wind farm collision off Norfolk coast  Maritime and Coastguard Agency Geoffrey Whinfrey was in charge of the Island Panther when it collided with a wind turbine in the Sheringham Shoal wind farm on 21 November 2012. Whinfrey had been requested by the wind farm operator - Scira Offshore Energy Ltd - that the Island Panther take off duty employees ashore due to the worsening weather conditions. It was dark and the wind was gusting up to 45mph, with driving rain and rough seas. Passage plans had not been completed for any part of the journey. Whinfrey attempted to navigate through the wind farm using the safety lights on the wind turbine towers, which is against company policy. While passing through the wind farm he failed to notice that one of the turbine towers’ lights was not illuminated and subsequently hit that tower head on at approximately 12 knots. The collision resulted in Mr. Whinfrey and his fellow crewman flying forward and hitting the control consul, plus people below were flung across the passenger cabin. Some of those onboard had to be taken to hospital with minor injuries and the vessel was also considerably damaged. An investigation determined that the accident happened as Mr. Whinfrey was relying solely on the turbine safety lights and didn’t make good use of the lookout and navigation equipment on board. Whinfrey pleaded guilty at Southampton Magistrates Court on Tuesday 2 September 2014 to breaches of Rule 5 of the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972. He was fined £1,000, plus £2,000 in costs. Captain Peter Maynard, MCA Surveyor based at the Norwich Marine Office, said: Mr. Whinfrey relied heavily on the lights of the turbine towers to navigate through the wind farm against company policy. He displayed poor seamanship by failing to keep a proper lookout by all available means appropriate in the prevailing circumstances. It was very lucky that no one was seriously hurt. [Contact:1507]"

/government/news/5-foreign-flagged-ships-under-detention-in-the-uk-during-august-2014,"5 foreign flagged ships were under detention in UK ports during August 2014 after failing Port State Control (PSC) inspection. 5 foreign flagged ships under detention in the UK during August 2014  Maritime and Coastguard Agency During August, there was 1 new detention of a foreign flagged vessel in a UK port. 4 vessels remained under detention from previous months and 1 vessel was released during August. A total of 4 vessels remain under detention at the end of August. In response to one of the recommendations of Lord Donaldson’s Inquiry into the prevention of pollution from merchant shipping and in compliance with the EU Directive on Port State Control (2009/16/EC as amended), the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) publishes details of the foreign flagged vessels detained in UK ports each month. The UK is part of a regional agreement on port state control known as the Paris Memorandum of Understanding on Port State Control (Paris MOU) and information on all ships that are inspected is held centrally in an electronic database known as Thetis. This allows the ships of flags with poor detention records to be targeted for future inspection. Inspections of foreign flagged ships in UK ports are undertaken by surveyors from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. When a ship is found to be not in compliance with applicable Convention requirements, a deficiency may be raised. If the deficiency is so serious that it has to be rectified before departure, then the ship may be detained. All deficiencies should be rectified before departure if at all possible. When applicable, the list includes those passenger craft prevented from operating under the provisions of the EU Directive on Mandatory Surveys for the safe operation of regular Ro-Ro ferry and high speed passenger craft services (1999/35/EU).

/government/news/new-national-coastguard-operations-centre-opens,"The new National Maritime Operations Centre (NMOC) in Hampshire becomes operational for the very first time this week. New national Coastguard operations centre opens  Maritime and Coastguard Agency Operations from Solent Coastguard, which looks after Hampshire, Isle of Wight and parts of Sussex, are being transferred over from Monday 8 September 2014. The handover of Portland Coastguard, which covers Dorset and East Devon, will start on Monday 15 September 2014. The changes to Her Majesty’s Coastguard will see the NMOC and 10 other Coastguard Operation Centres around the UK work together to manage the workload. This means in a search and rescue incident there will be a much bigger and better support network available nationally. There will be no reduction in rescue resources. The availability of Coastguard Rescue Teams, lifeboats, rescue helicopters and other rescue units will be unaffected. Mark Rodaway has moved across from Portland Coastguard and taken up a new role at the NMOC . He said: The public won’t notice any difference to the way search and rescue missions are responded to. If you call 999 and ask for the Coastguard, or issue a mayday broadcast, we will still be here to help you. The only change is that we now have a new centre that will be able to oversee and assist with operations around the whole of the UK, with a mix of experienced personnel alongside Maritime Operations Officers that have chosen to pursue an exciting career with the Coastguard. I am incredibly grateful to the staff both at Solent and Portland Coastguard, who have served their region and local communities with great dedication and professionalism over many years. I am pleased that a good number of them are staying with the Coastguard and have relocated to roles at our new national centre.” 47 Coastguards are now based at the new centre near Fareham. Once the new national network is complete by the end of 2015, there will be 96 Coastguards based at the centre. Matthew West, who has moved from Solent Coastguard to the NMOC , said: Coastguards at the NMOC have been through an extensive training programme in the past few months, including live exercises with lifeboats and Coastguard Rescue Teams. It’s an exciting time for us, as we now have a new state-of-the-art operations centre where we can put our knowledge and skills to good use in coordinating search and rescue missions. The new national network is scheduled to be fully operational by the end of 2015. [Contact:1507]"
/government/news/lucky-escape-for-rib-trio-off-anglesey,"3 people and their dog had a lucky escape off Anglesey when they were thrown from a RIB which then circled them at high speed. Lucky escape for RIB trio off Anglesey  Maritime and Coastguard Agency The incident has underlined the need to use a kill-cord – the device that is attached to a RIB driver and immediately shuts down the motor when the wearer moves away, or is thrown, from the cockpit. In the past, deaths and horrific injuries have been caused by the propellers of high-powered, out-of-control boats to people who have fallen out. In this case, the occupants managed to avoid the circling RIB and swim to nearby rocks at Rosneigr Beach. They were picked up by a boat and taken to the shore unscathed; the RIB was quickly brought under control. The RIB ’s occupants told Holyhead Coastguard, who were alerted at 12.30pm on Thursday 11 September 2014 by the local surf shop, that the driver had removed the kill-cord to inspect a deflated buoyancy chamber and they had been thrown out of the craft when the throttle had been activated. Duty Watch Manager at Holyhead Coastguard, Barry Priddis, said: “This incident might have had a far more tragic conclusion and the occupants of the RIB had a very lucky escape. Kill-cords should be worn at all times, regardless of whether a boat is stationary or under way. All too often Coastguards deal with sometimes horrendous incidents where a kill-cord is removed only temporarily.” [Contact:1507]"
/government/news/concerns-that-angler-may-be-missing-from-mudeford,"Coastguards have issued an appeal to an angler, who may have left their fishing gear on the beach near Mudeford Quay, Christchurch. Concerns that angler may be missing from Mudeford  Maritime and Coastguard Agency Dorset Police reported that some high quality fishing tackle had apparently been abandoned on the steeply shelving beach at the entrance to Christchurch Harbour – leading to concerns that the angler may have entered the water and got into difficulties. The equipment was discovered by a dog-walker at 6:30am on Wednesday 17 September 2014. The Mudeford lifeboat, Southbourne Coastguard Rescue Team, the Coastguard search and rescue helicopter from Lee-on-Solent and the police were all involved in a search. Watch Officer at Portland Coastguard, Becky Clarke, said: The fact that some expensive fishing tackle has simply been left on the beach has raised fears that an angler has possibly gone into the water. We are appealing to anyone who thinks that they are this angler – or knows who it might be - to please get in touch with the Coastguard by calling 999. The search was suspended yesterday afternoon pending further information. [Contact:1507]"
/government/news/barge-operator-fined-for-releasing-dangerous-gas,"The operator of a Portsmouth-based barge has been made to pay almost £111,000 in fines and costs. Barge operator fined for releasing dangerous gas  Maritime and Coastguard Agency Serco Ltd admitted an offence at Portsmouth Crown Court in relation to the health and safety of workers aboard the barge 1706, which is operated as part of a service contract with the Ministry of Defence. The primary function of the barge is to collect waste products from naval vessels when they were moored in Portsmouth. On the 6 July 2011, barge 1706 was secured alongside a warship at Portsmouth Naval Base and was taking waste water from the vessel. A short while later, the crew started to smell the distinctive ‘rotten eggs’ odour of hydrogen sulphide (H2S). A crewman collected the only personal gas detector on board and, as soon as he went on deck, the monitor alarmed at 57 parts per million (ppm) – well above the prescribed danger limits of 5ppm (8 hour time-weighted average (TWA)) and 10ppm (15 minute TWA). The crew contacted the Operations Manager but the process was not stopped as it was decided that the monitor was malfunctioning. A safety boat was sent to the barge to standby as a precaution. A short while later, the gas monitor’s alarm was set off once again, this time registering at 87ppm. At this stage the crew started to feel unwell and the decision was then made to stop the operation and evacuate the barge. The two crew were taken to hospital for treatment. An investigation by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) showed a number of health and safety failings by the operator. These included unsafe practice by leaving the tank lids open; safety equipment, such as the gas monitor, not being properly maintained or calibrated, and the crew not properly trained in how to use the safety equipment. On Tuesday 23 September 2014, Serco Ltd were fined £50,000, with £60,716 in costs and a £120 victim surcharge. The court took into account the early guilty plea and, in passing, sentence HH Judge Hetherington said: There was a failure of local managment to ensure that the written instructions were complied with. This failure is made all the worse because the point had been identified that on more than one occasion audits had been carried out and it was noted that tank content guages were not active and the raising of tank lids was used instead. It is of course significant that, despite the serious risk, it was fortunate that there were no deaths or serious injuries. Julie Carlton, Seafarer Safety and Health Manager at the Maritime and Coastguard Agency said: This was a very serious yet avoidable incident. A properly functioning safety management system would have identified the need to maintain and calibrate the gas monitor correctly, ensuring it was in good working order. Then perhaps the crew and their supervisor would have trusted its reading, and recognised the need to stop the operation as soon as the hazard was identified. Companies must constantly be alert to risks and hazards involved in their operations and review and update their safety management systems at regular intervals accordingly. Front line staff are an excellent source of identifying risks and hazards and should be encouraged to speak up when they identify any. Their active input is key to the development of an effective safety management system. All need to be fully aware of safety procedures and understand the dangers of not following them.

/government/news/mca-chief-underlines-importance-of-superyacht-industry,"Sir Alan Massey, Chief Executive of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA), has outlined the importance of the superyacht industry. MCA Chief underlines importance of superyacht industry  Maritime and Coastguard Agency Sir Alan was speaking at the Monaco Yacht Show on Thursday 25 September 2014. He was there representing the UK’s Shipping Minister, John Hayes. Also in the UK contingent were Her Majesty’s Ambassador to Paris and representatives of the UK Chamber of Shipping, together with the industry body, Superyacht UK. The MCA is a world leader in maritime administration and the originator of the Large Commercial Yacht Code, LY3, which covers safety for yachts that are more than 24-metres in length. Ensign, the MCA ’s large yacht services division, offers sector-leading advice and guidance in areas including the LY3 code, the Maritime Labour Convention and Seafarers’ Standards. Opening his presentation, Sir Alan highlighted the commitment and continued support the industry receives from the MCA , on behalf of the Government, which extends to both the surveying and training aspects of the industry. He outlined new initiatives in yacht engineer officer training, including fully transferrable qualifications between different categories of vessel. He said: The MCA is one of a very few maritime administrations in the world dealing specifically with yacht qualifications under STCW . Sir Alan also spoke of his pride in the work the MCA is doing to implement Maritime Labour Convention (MLC) which, he said: …is so important for the safety and wellbeing of all those who earn their living at sea. The contribution of the industry to the work of the MCA was also praised. Sir Alan said: Those of us working in the field of standard setting and regulation are grateful for the solid support we get from industry – including the Professional Yachting Association and others – in collaborating in the industry working groups for LY3 and the Passenger Yacht Code. With a current focus on coding for passenger yachts – which Sir Alan highlighted as a sector that was clearly growing in confidence with new vessels under construction - the next task for the MCA would be the development of standards for sailing passenger yachts, working with the Superyacht Builders Association. Sir Alan closed his presentation by saying: I thank you for the continued support and cooperation with each other, and with the MCA . It is a relationship we welcome and treasure and want to see go from strength to strength. During the Monaco Yacht Show, detailed information on Ensign was available to visitors and exhibitors; MCA surveyors and its Head of Seafarer Services and Ship Registration were on hand to answer questions relating to current regulations and policies across the field of commercial yacht coding, surveying, training and certification, and United Kingdom ship registration.

/government/news/port-company-fined-650000-for-health-and-safety-breaches,"Port operator pleads guilty to health and safety breaches following deaths of three crew on the River Clyde in 2007. Port company fined £650,000 for health and safety breaches  Maritime and Coastguard Agency Clydeport Operations Ltd, who were sentenced at the High Court in Edinburgh today (Monday 29 September 2014), received fines totalling £650,000. In December 2007 the Flying Phantom was one of three tugs assisting the 70,000-tonne cargo ship Red Jasmine as it made its way along the River Clyde. As they approached the Erskine Bridge, the Flying Phantom was secured to the bow of the Red Jasmine, which was transporting animal feed. Just before 6pm, in thick fog, the Flying Phantom called the ship to say they had grounded and the pilot instructed the tug to let go the line. That was the last communication. The line came taut and the tug was pulled over and capsized – a situation known as “girting”. The tug’s master, Stephen Humphreys, 33, chief engineer, Robert Cameron, 65, and rating, Eric Blackley, 57, lost their lives. The mate, Brian Aitchison, 37, managed to climb clear before the tug sank and was rescued. Last week (Tuesday 23 September) in the Edinburgh High Court, Clydeport Operations Limited, owned by Peel Ports Limited, admitted breaches of the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974. The company accepted that between 29 December 2000 and 19 December 2007 there had been a systemic failure in risk assessments and safe systems of work. The company was fined £650,000. The tug operator Svitzer Marine Limited had previously admitted to proximate cause of the deaths. The MCA took over the maritime element of the investigation from Strathclyde Police, once it was determined that the deaths were not suspicious. However, the investigation remained under the control of the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service. The MCA found that there were also shortcomings in the application of the Port Marine Safety code in that neither the company secretary, nor the operations/human resources director, received training to adequately fulfil their role as the designated person with responsibility to ensure health and safety. The charges included a similar accident with a ship, the Abu Egila, at the same place in September 2000 when the Flying Phantom was also the lead tug. On this occasion the tug was let go and there were no injuries. Sentencing at the High Court in Edinburgh on 29 September the judge, Lord Kinclaven, said: The charges are severally and jointly very serious and extended for a long period of time, from 2000 to 2007. Captain Jeremy Smart, Head of Enforcement at the MCA , said: This was a tragic event and the MCA would like to express its sincere condolences to the families involved, who have endured a very difficult number of years. The investigation highlighted some very serious shortcomings in Clydeport Operations Limited’s safety management. [Contact:1507]"

While looking back is important, I want to just say a few words about the future. While the docks that once surrounded this ship have gone elsewhere, the sea remains the single most important connection between us and our trading partners. Put simply, shipping is an engine of growth for Britain’s economy. That’s why as Shipping Minister my commitment is to do all I can to ensure the British shipping industry continues to thrive . As an island nation the maritime industry is of crucial importance to the UK, up to 95% of our goods arrive by sea. Shipping contributes around £12 billion a year to the UK economy and provides employment for many thousands of people. British seafarers are recognised around the world for their skill, dedication and leadership. The fundamental reason for this is the quality of the vibrant maritime training programmes that are available. The long term health of the maritime sector relies on a sufficient supply of trained seafarers now and in the future. But there are problems to overcome. By 2021 it has been estimated that there will be a shortfall of around 3,500 British trained deck and engineering officers. Without the next generation of seafarers, it is unlikely that the UK will be able to retain its worldwide reputation for having the most skilled, highly trained and committed workforce. I want young people to know that a maritime career is an excellent decision. They need to know, it’s an industry which is interesting, challenging and there are good opportunities to progress. If you work hard, you’ll go far - and in shipping that could be very far indeed!. That’s a message I want to be heard far and wide. That’s why attracting and training more UK seafarers is one of the 3 priorities for UK shipping we agreed with the industry and trades unions last year. There are 3 primary things that we are doing to help. First, the Tonnage Tax has supported around 22,000 months of officer training so far. There are 78 company groups currently active within the scheme, accounting for around 880 ships. The total cumulative training commitment for 2013 is for around 1,700 trainee places. Second, the government is committed to putting the right mechanisms and infrastructure in place so the industry can build on what it has already achieved. As such, the government continues to invest in the future maritime workforce through the Support for Maritime Training programme ( SMarT ), which has an annual budget of £12 million per year. We announced last September that the £12 million budget set until 2016 will receive a boost of up to £3 million a year, an increase of 25%. That’s because we believe sustaining the UK’s skills base and to maintaining the quality of the maritime training programmes is essential. Third, maritime will be one of the priorities for our new apprenticeships schemes . The standards for deck, engine room and catering ratings will be developed by employers. That will ensure the apprenticeships provide the skills employers need and the qualifications people want to secure a good job. A few days ago I met with ministers from across government, industry representatives and the trades unions to see if more could be done. We agreed that we would make SMarT funding available for junior officers completing training towards their second certificate of competency. I believe that funding this training will be more attractive to those seeking to improve their qualifications and make them even more valuable to the marine industries. So that’s what we are doing to help. But as the philosopher John Locke said: education begins the journey but good company and reflection must finish it. That sums up for me why having a mentor is just so important. The cadets and junior officers who you will be supporting are embarking on a long voyage. You have the knowledge to guide them, particularly when they might have doubts and questions whether they’ve made the right decisions. And by being there you are an inspiration. You show that the long journey can be completed and they can fulfil their aspirations. That is something only you can do. So, in conclusion, I would like to take this opportunity to say: thank you. You are making a major long-term, commitment. But your commitment is incredibly important. I think you are absolutely one of the reasons British seafarers are widely held to be among the best in the world. By caring about the industry and the people who work in it, you play an absolutely vital role in its long term success. The Honourable Company is to be both envied and commended in designing this unique scheme which can be a beacon for other organisations in Britain and abroad. So thank you all for your fantastic contribution. I look forward to hearing about the details of the scheme and your roles within it. I hope you enjoy the rest of the afternoon."
/government/news/minister-awards-mcas-trainee-of-the-year,"The “hard work and dedication” of a 25-year old Merchant Navy officer cadet has been recognised. Minister Awards MCA's Trainee of the Year  Maritime and Coastguard Agency Jonty Turnbull of Blackpool and the Fylde College, who was serving on-board the Foreland Shipping-owned vessel, MV Hartland Point, is the 2014 winner of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency’s (MCA) Officer Trainee of the Year Award. The award will be presented at Haberdashers Hall, London, by the Rt Hon John Hayes MP, Minister of State for Transport, who said, “I am delighted to attend the ceremony tomorrow. It is so important that we celebrate these achievements, not just for the individuals involved, but to ensure we all share in the pride and grow through the success of all the winners. The esteem in which the UK maritime sector is held worldwide is itself a celebration of our maritime heritage - past, present and future.” The award aims to encourage and recognise quality within the maritime industry, which is hugely important to the UK economy, contributing around £14 billion per year. An essential component of the UK’s success in this sector are the excellent maritime training programmes available to new seafarers. Nominations are made by nautical colleges alongside the trainee’s Sponsoring Company. The winner is decided by a panel of judges, which includes representatives from the MCA and other industry figures. The Master of the MV Hartland Point, Captain Kevin Foulkes, said: “I am delighted that Jonty Turnbull has been recognised for this award, which is very well deserved. Jonty has currently stepped up to do the Second Officer role for a period of time and has taken this very much in his stride. He continues to impress colleagues with his hard work and dedication to the job.” In its citation, the judging panel said that they were “very impressed with Jonty and his achievements” and that, “his drive and enthusiasm for the Merchant Navy really stood out.” Julie Arnold, Training and Cadet Manager from Bibby Ship Management said: “I am really proud of Jonty as he was an outstanding Trainee Officer to mentor throughout his three year cadetship. He has worked relentlessly and we are proud of the fact that he represented Bibby Line Limited so well! We aim to provide excellent training to all our Trainee Officer’s to the highest standards and Jonty’s MCA Trainee Office of the Year Award highlights the fact that we’re on the right lines.” Sir Alan Massey, Chief Executive of the MCA, will attend the ceremony. He said: “Having high-calibre officers is vital to the future health of the UK shipping industry. At the Maritime and Coastguard Agency we are committed to recognising and promoting excellence and are therefore delighted that this year’s award is going to such a deserving candidate. I wish Jonty every success for what I am sure will be a very impressive career.” [Contact:1507]"
/government/news/hovercraft-pilot-jailed-for-being-over-alcohol-limit,"A Hovercraft pilot from the Isle of Wight has been jailed for 8 months after pleading guilty to being over the alcohol limit while on duty.  Hovercraft pilot jailed for being over alcohol limit  Maritime and Coastguard Agency 50-year-old Richard Pease fell ill at the controls of a Hovertravel hovercraft heading from Portsmouth to Ryde on 22 June 2014. During the course of the day, a total of 134 passengers had travelled on board the Freedom 90 hovercraft which was under the control of Pease. He had also been unable to get up the ramp at Southsea until a colleague boarded the vessel and took over the controls. No one was injured. Pease, from Cowes, was later breathalysed and was found to have 96 micrograms of alcohol in 100ml of breath, three times the drink drive limit of 35mg. At a previous hearing Pease pleaded guilty to being a master of a hovercraft having consumed excess alcohol, under the Railways and Transport Safety Act 2003. He was jailed for 8 months. In sentencing, Judge Susan Evans, said: You put in jeopardy the safety of your passengers, your crew and other vessels in the Solent. This was a grave dereliction of duty and your actions could have resulted in tragedy. Neil Cunningham, Maritime and Coastguard Agency Enforcement Officer, said: The Master of any vessel has a duty of care to their crew and passengers, so to carry out this responsibility whilst under the influence of alcohol is totally irresponsible. Mr Pease was clearly not in any fit state to carry out his duties safely. It is incredibly fortunate that no-one was hurt in this case. I would like to take this opportunity to praise the quick thinking of a crew member on board the Hovercraft Freedom 90 for safely bringing the craft to a stop in Ryde and also to thank Hovertravel for its cooperation and assistance throughout this investigation.

/government/news/crew-member-of-newlyn-fishing-boat-failed-to-keep-lookout,"A crew member of a Newlyn fishing boat has been ordered to pay a total of £2,100 in fines and costs after failing to keep a proper lookout. Crew member of Newlyn fishing boat failed to keep lookout  Maritime and Coastguard Agency At a hearing on Friday 10 October at Bodmin Magistrates Court, Andrew Cowan-Dickie , a crew member of the Newlyn based trawler, James R H Stevenson, pleaded guilty to failing to keep a proper lookout which resulted in a collision with another vessel. He was fined £1,000, with £1,000 in costs and a £100 victim surcharge, following an investigation by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. In sentencing, magistrates took into account Mr Cowan-Dickie’s previous good character. On 25 March this year, the James R H Stevenson left Newlyn harbour with four crew on board and headed towards fishing grounds south of Cornwall. Mr Cowan-Dickie took over as the Officer of the Watch and was the only person on the bridge. At 4:30pm that afternoon the vessel was in collision with a 2,000-tonne coaster, Pommern, 14 nautical miles south of Newlyn Harbour. The collision caused considerable damage to the coaster. Mr Cowan-Dickie was subsequently interviewed by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency’s Enforcement team and admitted that he was in control of the fishing vessel, but simply failed to see the coaster. Mr Chris Uglow, Principal Fishing Vessel Surveyor, based at the Maritime and Coastguard Agency’s Falmouth Marine Office, said: When under way all vessels should keep a proper lookout at all times using all available means; it is clear in this case that this did not take place, resulting in a collision that caused significant damage, and could easily have resulted in multiple casualties and pollution along the south coast of Cornwall. Notes to Editors A screen-grab of the vessel track, showing the location of the collision, and an image of Pommern are available from the MCA press office. [Contact:1507]"
/government/news/want-to-make-a-difference-in-north-yorkshire-become-a-coastguard,"This October, we are all being asked to ‘Make A Difference’ and what better way to do so than by volunteering with the Coastguard Rescue Service. Want to make a difference in north Yorkshire? Become a Coastguard  Maritime and Coastguard Agency ‘Make A Difference’ is a month long campaign by the charity Community Service Volunteers (CSV) to encourage more people to volunteer. Her Majesty’s Coastguard is the emergency service responsible for coordinating maritime search and rescue in the UK. One rescue resource often called into action is the Coastguard Rescue Teams. There are 347 of these teams in the UK, made up of more than 3,200 volunteers. The Redcar, Robin Hood’s Bay, Skinningrove, Staithes and Whitby teams are currently looking for new recruits. In the past year, the teams have collectively been involved in more than 200 incidents, ranging from capsized boats to people stuck on cliffs and water rescues. Chris Coulter, Senior Coastal Operations Officer at Whitby, said: Coastguard Rescue Officers are on call 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, ready to respond at a moment’s notice. They’re trained in first aid and a variety of rescue techniques, from water, mud, rope and cliff rescues, to search methods and assisting helicopter operations. People across Yorkshire are privileged to have these rescue teams which form an integral part of their communities. They respond to callouts every day of the year, in all weathers and often at unsocial hours to assist people in distress. You’ll be given regular training, and all we ask in return is that you are situated within 20 minutes of the Coastguard base, and be available to respond at most times. But it’s not just rescues that the teams get involved with. As a Coastguard Rescue Officer, you may also spend time educating people in coastal safety. This preventative work includes visiting schools and shows as well as patrolling the coast to advise people of the dangers. Keith Gregory, Deputy Station Officer at Staithes Coastguard Rescue Team, said: Since becoming a Coastguard Rescue Officer I have found that my life has been enhanced in a number of ways. Of course there is a lot of commitment needed at times. When you are sitting down to Christmas dinner and the pager goes off then you have to go. If you are fast asleep at 3am and the pager goes off, again we just go. However, the positive side of that commitment is the feeling that you have achieved something and are making a difference, however large or small, to people who need our help. It definitely changes you as a person. There’s a greater sense of self-worth from very early on. I would highly recommend joining.

Today (Friday 31 October 2014) Mr. Gallagher pleaded at Southampton Magistrates Court to breach of Section 58 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1995. He was fined £1,500 and told to pay £8,082 in costs plus a victim surcharge of £120. Gwen Lancaster, Surveyor in Charge at Hull MCA Marine Office, said: Mr. Gallagher should have kept a proper lookout at all times using all available means and be competent in using all his electronic navigational equipment.

A total of 3 vessels remain under detention at the end of September. In response to one of the recommendations of Lord Donaldson’s Inquiry into the prevention of pollution from merchant shipping and in compliance with the EU Directive on Port State Control (2009/16/EC as amended), the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) publishes details of the foreign flagged vessels detained in UK ports each month. The UK is part of a regional agreement on port state control known as the Paris Memorandum of Understanding on Port State Control (Paris MOU) and information on all ships that are inspected is held centrally in an electronic database known as Thetis. This allows the ships of flags with poor detention records to be targeted for future inspection. Inspections of foreign flagged ships in UK ports are undertaken by surveyors from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. When a ship is found to be not in compliance with applicable Convention requirements, a deficiency may be raised. If the deficiency is so serious that it has to be rectified before departure, then the ship may be detained. All deficiencies should be rectified before departure if at all possible.

/government/news/join-the-coastguard-rescue-service-in-tayside,"People living in coastal communities across Tayside are being asked if they want to make a difference and become Coastguard Rescue Officers. Join the Coastguard Rescue Service in Tayside  Maritime and Coastguard Agency Her Majesty’s Coastguard is the emergency service responsible for coordinating maritime search and rescue in the UK. One rescue resource often called into action at any time, day or night, is the Coastguard Rescue Teams. There are 347 of these teams in the UK, made up of more than 3,200 volunteers. The Arbroath, Montrose, Stonehaven and Carnoustie teams are currently looking for new recruits. So far this year, the teams have collectively been involved in almost 200 incidents, ranging from capsized boats, cliff fallers to missing anglers and people cut off by the tide. Coastguard Area Commander Ross Greenhill said: Coastal communities are privileged to have these rescue teams which form an integral part of society. They respond to callouts in all weathers and often at unsocial hours to assist people in distress. Coastguard Rescue Officers are trained in first aid and a variety of rescue techniques, from water, mud, rope and cliff rescues, to search methods and assisting helicopter operations. Aside from giving your time to a worthy cause, volunteering has a number of key benefits for your career too. It can help you stand out from the crowd, learn practical skills, and will look great on your CV. If you’d like to join, we’ll ensure you have regular training, and all we ask in return is that you are situated within 20 minutes of the Coastguard base, and be available to respond at most times. But it’s not just rescues that the teams get involved with. Coastguard Rescue Officers also spend time visiting schools, clubs and other public places to help people stay safe at sea and along the coast. Susan Simpson, from the Arbroath Coastguard Rescue Team, said: I am immensely proud to be a Coastguard Rescue Officer and during my 2 years in the service I have grown in confidence, not only for the job at hand but I have become a far more confident person in my private life too. My family and friends are also very proud of what I do and my daughter loves to tell anyone who will listen that ‘mummy helps people in danger’ which again fills me with pride. If you have ever thought about it, my advice is just do it. I am very passionate about what I do and being part of such a vital service to the community is a reward like no other.

/government/news/8-foreign-flagged-ships-under-detention-in-the-uk-during-november-2014,"8 foreign flagged ships were under detention in UK ports during November 2014 after failing Port State Control (PSC) inspection. 8 foreign flagged ships under detention in the UK during November 2014  Maritime and Coastguard Agency During November, there were 6 new detentions of foreign flagged vessels in a UK port. 2 vessels remained under detention from previous months and 5 vessels were released during November. A total of 3 vessels remain under detention at the end of November. In response to one of the recommendations of Lord Donaldson’s Inquiry into the prevention of pollution from merchant shipping and in compliance with the EU Directive on Port State Control (2009/16/EC as amended), the Maritime and Coastguard agency ( MCA ) publishes details of the foreign flagged vessels detained in UK ports each month. The UK is part of a regional agreement on port state control known as the Paris Memorandum of Understanding on Port State Control (Paris MOU) and information on all ships that are inspected is held centrally in an electronic database known as Thetis. This allows the ships of flags with poor detention records to be targeted for future inspection. Inspections of foreign flagged ships in UK ports are undertaken by surveyors from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. When a ship is found to be not in compliance with applicable Convention requirements, a deficiency may be raised. If the deficiency is so serious that it has to be rectified before departure, then the ship may be detained. All deficiencies should be rectified before departure if at all possible. When applicable, the list includes those passenger craft prevented from operating under the provisions of the EU Directive on Mandatory Surveys for the safe operation of regular Ro-Ro ferry and high speed passenger craft services (1999/35/EU).

/government/news/dutch-chief-mate-sentenced-for-fatal-collision,"Details of the court case for the ""Shoreway"" collision with the ""Orca"" Dutch Chief Mate sentenced for fatal collision  Maritime and Coastguard Agency On the 8th June 2014 the “Shoreway”, a 98 metre 5000 tonne dredger, owned by Koninklijke Boskalis Westminster NV, collided with a Moody 31 sailing yacht “Orca” at the entrance to the River Orwell in Suffolk. At the helm of the Shoreway at the time was Mr Gerardus Chapel who was employed as Chief Mate. The Shoreway had just finished dredging in Felixstowe and was going out to sea to dump the spoils. The Shoreway for an unknown reason left the deep water channel into an area frequented by pleasure vessels. In the area was the “Orca”, which was owned by Peter and Bernadine Ingram, who lived locally, were out for a day’s sailing in their yacht that they had owned for several years. Also on board the “Orca” were the Ingram’s two pet collie dogs. The “Shoreway” hit the “Orca” head on and cut a large hole in the vessel’s starboard side. The “Orca” sank almost immediately. Mr Ingram and one of his dogs managed to swim to the surface, but his wife and other dog were caught in the wreckage. Mrs Ingram’s body was recovered by divers the following day, along with their dog. At the time of the collision, the visibility was perfect and the weather was fine. When interviewed by MCA Enforcement Officers, Mr Chapel, who had been a qualified Captain for several years, admitted that he just did not see the yacht, even though it was clearly visible and on radar. Mr Chapel was sentenced to nine months, reduced to six months which has been suspended for 18 months, after pleading guilty to conduct endangering ships, structures or individuals, section 58 Merchant Shipping act 1995. In passing sentence His Hon Judge Devaux said “Chapel accepted responsibility, co-operated and pleaded guilty at the first available opportunity. “However, his failure to keep a proper watch caused Mrs Ingram’s death.” Captain Roger Towner, Assistant Director from the MCA ’s Maritime Safety & Standards branch said that it was clearly evident that Mr Chapel had failed to keep a proper lookout by all available means, which resulted in this tragic incident.

/government/speeches/our-future-as-a-maritime-nation,"Britain’s shipping industry has a proud history, but must meet the challenges of the modern world. Our future as a maritime nation  Maritime and Coastguard Agency Department for Transport Introduction Good afternoon everyone. And first of all thank you for finding time in your busy schedules to be here. Because the theme of my speech today (10 March 2015) is of immense importance. Not just to the future of Britain as a maritime power. But to our future as a major trading nation, with ambitions to compete and thrive in the 21st century global economy. We have so much to be proud of in our maritime industries . A rich and extraordinary history. A flag that is respected around the world. Ports, training institutions, and maritime services that are recognised globally for their excellence. Shipping and ports are the lifeblood of our economy. Moving up to 95% of the UK’s international trade. Providing UK consumers with an ever-growing choice of goods. And UK exporters with the connections they need to compete. Yet this self same industry. This priceless national asset. Is facing increasing challenges. Challenges from abroad. And challenges at home. If we fail to meet these challenges, then there’s a danger that our rivals will start to overtake us. And that would be a tragedy. Not just for the UK’s maritime industries. But for Britain itself. So today. Two months before the general election. Is an opportunity to take stock. To look at the progress we have made over the past 5 years. But also to set out a blueprint for the future. A clear plan of action for maritime, that I hope will help the next Shipping and Ports Minister, and the next government, to provide the support the industry needs. Vision I make no apologies for being ambitious. For those with the power to exercise change, to inspire and enthral, they must free themselves from the mechanistic constraints of a technocratic approach to politics. My ambition is for Britain to be recognised as the world’s most important maritime centre. I want to spread the word that we’re not just open for maritime business. But that we will scout relentlessly for new business around the globe. So we become a natural home for multinational maritime companies and organisations. A country with the skills, innovation and expertise to meet the needs of international trade. And which maintains the highest standards in safety and environmental protection. Challenges As I will explain today, in many ways, we are making progress towards this vision. But I also want to be frank about where we’re falling short. My first frustration is simply that we don’t shout about our maritime industry enough. Considering its influence and importance – it has an unaccountably low public profile. When was the last time you read a story about our shipping industry on the front page of your morning paper? News editors appear to love anything on rail, roads or aviation. But shipping? Which contributes £5.6 billion to the country’s GDP . Or ports? Which employ 107,000 people here appear to operate within a bubble. To such an extent that many people have no idea of just how important they are. And that brings a danger. As other countries compete harder and harder. That we underestimate our modern maritime industry. That we assume it’s a fading business in the high-tech 21st century. In an era of super-jumbo jets. Zero-emission motoring. And high speed rail lines criss-crossing continents around the world. One thing’s for sure. We cannot afford to live on past glories alone. Yes, we have a long and proud history as a maritime nation. Once, all knew that Britain ruled the waves. But I want us to be just as proud now. The image of the River Thames crowded with ships and barges laden with goods is not some distant memory of England past as evoked by HG Wells in Tono-Bungay or Joseph Conrad in Heart of Darkness. For supermarket shelves to be stocked. For raw materials to be delivered to our factories. And for world beating British firms to reach global markets. We depend on our docks, our shipping and our seafarers. In fact we are just as reliant on sea trade as we were centuries ago. When the East India Company was transforming links across the Empire. And when shipping was providing British industry with the competitive advantage it needed to prosper. Today, the UK remains home to a flourishing, dynamic and innovative maritime sector, successfully supporting UK trade and the wider economy. Seafaring, and the skills that support it, will be at the heart of our island nation’s life for all time. So let’s make sure we appreciate and promote our maritime industry. Not just abroad to potential customers but at home too. So everyone realises that if we want to thrive as a country, our maritime industries must also continue to thrive. Growth Because we certainly have a good story to tell. The volume of freight travelling through UK ports has increased by 19% since 1980. The gross tonnage of trading vessels registered to the UK flag increased five-fold between 1999 and the peak in 2009. And the gross value added of the sector as a whole trebled between 2002 and 2008. This puts the maritime sector on a par with aviation - and larger than pharmaceuticals. Britain’s shipping sector has responded well to technological change. Take the way that the industry has cut freight costs and carbon emissions by building larger, more efficient and greener ships. Or the way ports have modernised to service those bigger ships. British innovation has played a huge role in improving maritime safety, and reducing risks of environmental damage. Our maritime business services are renowned for their excellence. Staffed by skilled and dedicated professionals. And the quality of our flag is respected all over the world. So today I would like to pay tribute to everyone who has contributed to this success story. From ports and ship operators. To the maritime support sector and trade unions. And to my predecessors, including Stephen Hammond and Mike Penning - and ministers in previous administrations. Competition It is right that we celebrate what has been achieved. But we also have to look ahead. We know that world trade is expected to double over the next 20 years or so. But much of that increase will be outside Europe. Our position as a global maritime centre will face increasing competition particularly from the Far East. To secure our future and develop our sector we must be imaginative, innovative and inspire the next generation of entrepreneurs, embrace world-beating new developments and encourage tomorrow’s maritime leaders. The old contrasts between north and south hemispheres. Between Third World and First World. Or between west and east. Are rapidly breaking down. Countries like China, Brazil, Malaysia and India are emerging as new superpowers, with the political commitment, economic capacity and low cost labour to challenge the established economic order. And that’s going to change world shipping. In fact, it’s already doing so. Our position as a global maritime centre is under threat. And we are seeing some signs that we may be losing ground in the ensuing struggle. Since its high point around 2009, the UK ship register has declined by around 17% in gross tonnage. And estimates of the Gross Value Added from shipping – although not necessarily reflecting the maritime sector as a whole – also show signs of shrinking. We simply cannot afford to stand still while others up their game. Or simply undercut us. It is not just that we need to respond (I am never bound by mere necessity). We have a duty to respond. So let me explain how Explain what more we need to do to compete on a global level. Skills If you ask me where we can find the future of British shipping, my answer is clear. In our schools and universities. One of the best ways we can secure that future is to invest in skills and training. A subject close to my heart. A successful and sustainable industry needs the right people, with the right skills, and rewarding career paths to attract new entrants. We can all be stronger through opportunities grasped by those whose competencies reinforce our competitiveness. I want youngsters to be fired up about a maritime career. That means promoting it more effectively. As a dynamic industry providing rewarding and exciting job opportunities. So I was extremely pleased to see recent figures that showed the previous decline in UK seafarers has been halted - and numbers are beginning to rise. The maritime trailblazer group on apprenticeships has also made great strides. As a former Minister for Skills I am proud of our record on apprenticeships. More than 2 million have been created during this Parliament. That’s something to celebrate this week of all times as this is National Apprenticeship Week . In which we promote the range and breadth of apprenticeships. And we urge more businesses to take on apprentices, especially small business. There is no better way of learning a craft than by actually doing it, under skilled instruction in the workplace. And there is no better way to build a solid foundation for the future of the UK maritime sector. That is why we increased funding by 25% for the Support for Maritime Training (SMarT) scheme . To boost numbers of UK officer cadets and ratings. At £15 million a year, it is now the highest it has been. In 2014 we had 1,940 officer cadets in training – again the highest figure for very many years. And the quality of these cadets is outstanding. Something celebrated by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency Cadet of the Year Award. But of course there is more to be done, particularly around ratings training. So from October we will pilot an extension to the tonnage tax scheme. Allowing the option of training 3 able seafarer ratings each year in place of 1 officer cadet. To provide more opportunities for young people at every level of the industry. Business environment Skills are clearly integral to the maritime sector’s future. But the sector also needs a stable business and fiscal environment if it wants to grow. Building the best financial environment will encourage a bold, sustainable and home-grown maritime industry, attracting and supporting international business and inward investment to the UK. Britain will go into this general election in a dramatically better position than the last. We were absolutely clear when the coalition formed in May 2010 that our first priorities were tackling the record deficit, and stimulating an economic recovery. Well – we’ve kept our promise. Our long term economic plan is working. We’ve born down on our deficit, so today it’s half the level we inherited. And we are one of the fastest growing economies in the industrialised world. So we’ve built a stable economic platform on which shipping businesses can grow. And it’s critical that the next government doesn’t threaten that hard-earned advantage. We’ve worked incredibly closely with the maritime sector to take advantage of the opportunities that a stronger UK economy generates. For example, in 2013, we welcomed the world to the inaugural London International Shipping Week . I don’t need to remind you that it was a triumph. Preparations are well underway for the second Shipping Week this September. This will be another fantastic event, showcasing all that the UK has to offer. I encourage you all to play your part in making this as successful as the first event. Or even better. It’s also a real opportunity to raise the profile of maritime at home. We’ve also worked hard to develop a common understanding of important maritime objectives across Whitehall, and together with industry. The resulting joint strategic partnership plans for shipping and ports have provided a common framework for future action. A third plan – on maritime business services – will be published shortly. Together, these 3 initiatives set a very clear path ahead. Showing precisely what we need to do to create the right environment for businesses to thrive. Getting tax and regulation right remains among our highest priorities. We’ve seen how the introduction of a Tonnage Tax regime has spurred the regeneration of our maritime industries. Something that the UK helped pioneer. And something we continue to pioneer by linking Tonnage Tax and seafarer training. Through this scheme, we’ve provided shipping businesses with the stability and certainty they need to plan for the future. Despite others introducing similar schemes. Perhaps with fewer strings attached. We have retained our training requirement. So if you want to be in UK Tonnage Tax then you have to play your part in developing the skills base. We’ve helped reduce costs by significantly cutting red tape. We have simplified regulations dealing with ship safety, and also seafarer health and safety. And we have intervened to retain regulations if they have the potential to undermine safety in any way. Where possible, we’ve cut other costs, too. Last October, I agreed with my Irish counterpart that aids to navigation around the Republic of Ireland would be funded by income raised in Ireland. And I was delighted to announce another one penny cut in Light Dues, which will save the industry £2 million pounds a year. It means we will have reduced Light Dues by 19% in real terms since 2010. Shaping international outcomes So the business environment at home has improved significantly. But shipping is an international business by definition, and world trade that works for us requires international regulation and a level playing field for the whole industry. That is why we’re a stalwart supporter of the International Maritime Organisation, which we are most proud to host here in London. We’ve worked hard within the International Labour Organisation to secure an improved regulatory framework to protect the interests of seafarers. Within the IMO we have helped introduce an energy efficiency design index for new ships. This established for the first time a global mandatory greenhouse gas emission reduction regime for an entire economic sector. And we have ratified the ILO ’s Maritime Labour Convention, so that MCA surveyors are now checking that foreign flagged ships calling at UK ports meet the standards of seafarer welfare set out under the convention. Often, the international maritime community is in complete accord about new legislation. But sometimes, we to must say no to the EU to get the right results for UK shipping. So, where I’ve needed to, I’ve faced down the EU . We’ve turned the tide on the EU ’s port services regulation. And recognising that the new European sulphur limits were contentious. We worked with the industry to get our message across. Explaining the problems that the new regulations could cause. And developing more practical and proportionate ways to enforce the new standards. The seas flow everywhere, not just around Europe. This is therefore probably the least appropriate sector to have a strong EU influence. Operational delivery Maritime safety remains our absolute priority. The sea is brutal and unpredictable so maritime operations are often inherently hazardous. This is why we need a culture that ensures those using and working on the seas are as safe as they can be, and have the means and mechanisms to respond effectively should an incident occur. If ever any evidence were needed of such hazards, it was the tragic loss of the Cemfjord and the beaching of the Hoegh Osaka. So we will keep pushing to minimise risks. There have been countless examples over the last 5 years of government and maritime industry working together to protect seafarers from dangers. And to act with purpose when things do go wrong. As we did with the Hoegh Osaka. The Secretary of State’s Representative for Maritime Salvage and Intervention brings together everyone necessary to manage incidents. So today I’d like to thank all those who help in the event of trouble. The ever-present danger of the seas is why we invested £1.6 billion in the search and rescue helicopters, a vital service that operates in very difficult conditions to help 6,000 people a year. And when the coastguard transformation programme is finished in December, capability will improve still further. Keeping Britain supplied and connected Finally, let me turn to ports. The gateways to this country. Ports have grown, improved and thrived in recent times despite challenging conditions. Accepting the world’s largest and most specialised ships means we can ensure that UK ports are in pole position to generate growth. We will ensure ports continue to grow, and port infrastructure continues to attract inward investment. We have seen massive expansions at Felixstowe, London Gateway, Southampton, Immingham and Liverpool. All driven on a commercial basis with little need for taxpayer support. It was inspiring to see in January what was the world’s largest container ship visit Felixstowe as its first European port of call on its maiden voyage. But then only yesterday the same port hosted MSC Oscar, an even larger container ship. So the port sector is acutely responsive to the needs of its customers. Not just in taking goods off ships and onto land. But also providing added value to these industries. For example. Providing car storage to support the motor industry. Managing packaging and distribution to ensure the efficiency of supply chains. And supporting the growth of new energy supplies such as windfarms. And let’s not forget trust ports. Commercial businesses without shareholders but which are accountable to port users, local communities and Parliament. Our current trust port study is looking at the effectiveness of this model. While recommendations to strengthen accountability to ministers and the community will be made. I recognise that they too have developed new business. Supporting growth at both local and national levels. So UK ports have played an instrumental role in the economic recovery. And are in an excellent position to continue growing in the future. What next? So I’ve explained the challenges. From promoting the industry, to a more competitive trading environment. And I’ve talked about some of the ways in which we are responding. Now I want to turn to the future. And what we must do to secure our vision. For UK maritime to be a global leader, we need a strategy to meet the threats. And that will give us the greatest opportunities to grow. That is why we launched a ‘ Maritime growth study ’ earlier this year with an initial call for evidence. As Disraeli said: “The more extensive a man’s knowledge of what has been done, the greater will be his power of knowing what to do.” So the study asks: what are the future growth opportunities we should be focusing on? How can we best work together to seize those opportunities? And what action can be taken by both government and industry? We are already starting to hear a consistent message. Above all, we need regulatory stability. But the maritime industry also needs more investment in people and training. Everyone recognises the need for more coordinated promotion of the maritime sector. Of maritime business services. Of the value of the maritime sector to this country. Of maritime career opportunities. I am certain we can achieve all those things. Together. I am very grateful to Alderman Jeffrey Evans, who is chairing the study, and to Michael Parker who is heading up an essential industry advisory group. It is for Jeffrey, the advisory panel and the study itself to identify the necessary policy proposals and the evidence to support them. And I expect this work to shape the development of key policies beyond the election. Changes that will have to be taken forward if we are to sustain our position as a global maritime centre. By ministers, working in tandem with the industry and the trade unions. But although I don’t want to pre-empt the outcome of the study, I think it is possible to identify the broad areas where action will be needed. First, as I have made clear this afternoon, we must work collectively to raise the profile of the maritime sector. We cannot continue to be a world maritime centre if we do not trumpet our strengths and our objectives for the future. We will not attract high quality people if they’re unaware of what the industry has to offer in terms of rewarding and satisfying careers. And we will not win public support for UK maritime if people do not understand what you do or why it is important. I expect a radical shift in the way the industry is promoted. Second, we have to place even greater emphasis on supporting business, and welcoming investors who wish to come to the UK. Unless we show that we want businesses to come here, then they will choose somewhere else. That means demonstrating that we are responsive to their needs. We must resist interference in particular from the EU , which drives up costs and so blunts our competitive edge. So I call on my department to audit all up-coming regulatory proposals with the industry above and beyond the necessary. In short, I want no gold plating, no more pan-national bureaucratic burdens insensitive to our national interest. We must also co-ordinate efforts to sell ourselves internationally at every opportunity. What we have to offer is the largest concentration of maritime and marine services in the world. With unbeatable training, research and manufacturing facilities. These are fantastic assets – so let’s use them. Third, and I promised to be frank, we in government have to operate in a more joined up fashion. We cannot afford to have different departments implementing policies without others knowing what’s happening. It’s vital that businesses thinking of locating operations here know who they should be talking to. Let me give you an example. When I was a minister at BIS, I worked with the Department for Energy and Climate Change (not knowing then that I would be a minister in that department in the future) as we were seeking to build a new nuclear power station. The development of the Power Station, Hinckley Point B, requires a range of skills from its genesis to its end, following decommissioning perhaps a hundred years later. Mapping the competencies needed cooperation across government departments and partnership with a range of nuclear sector industries. We need to think on this scale, at this level, as we anticipate the consequences of other major infrastructure developments of the kind that must be at the heart of our ambitions for ports and shipping. To this end, we will establish a cross-departmental taskforce from which a plan with the maritime industries will be made Fourth – we have to accomplish these goals while sustaining and enhancing our reputation for safety, for quality and for the highest standards in everything we do. Lowering standards or dumbing down to compete with others is simply not an option. The Red Ensign is recognised around the world as a high quality flag. That is our biggest selling point. The UK is also recognised as a major player in setting international standards within the IMO . And as an island nation with some of the busiest shipping lanes in the world around our shores. So what we can offer is the very best that global maritime has to offer. Supported by the most pro-maritime and joined up government. With a determined conviction to support and grow our maritime sector further in the years ahead. And my fifth and final point - we need a continuing and renewed focus on high quality training, education and qualifications so we retain the skills we need as a maritime nation. Everyone I meet is passionate about maritime education and training – and rightly so. The breadth of career opportunities offered by the maritime and marine sectors is wide – from seafaring to marine insurance, from maritime law to boat building. We need to do more to raise the public consciousness of these opportunities. Particularly for young people. I want to see new opportunities created to attract and retain fresh talent across the whole of the sector. For without skilled people our maritime industries will die. It’s a sad fact that a large proportion of UK seafarers are nearing retirement age. While international competitors are successfully attracting much more young blood into the industry. I task everyone here in the room this evening with delivering this vision - of creating the maritime and marine sectors of the future. We already have some of the best, if not the best, maritime training institutions in the world. We need to make sure that they are filled with bright youngsters. Ambitious, professional and skilled people bringing fresh perspectives and ideas. And we work together - collectively – to create opportunities to train them at sea as well as ashore. I wondered about establishing a number, a target for recruitment and announcing it today, but that would not be right, whilst we have an industry led growth study missioned to make recommendations on such matters. So I task that study to determine a target for recruitment into this industry and to recommend a plan to make it happen. I expect numbers and details to be acted upon. Conclusion In conclusion then, we have seen real progress and improvement in recent years. But as we head for the general election, I think we need to be honest about where we’ve come from. And what we still have to do. That’s why the booklet , which I have pleasure to launch today, looks not only at our achievements and successes, but where future challenges lie. We have an extraordinary maritime history. And we have so many strengths. A strong flag. Superb maritime services. World-leading expertise. That’s why I am sure that the UK maritime industry can lead once again. So we’re not just a nation that is proud of its maritime past. But also proud of what we can be in the future. It is my vision that government, industry, the trade unions, universities and colleges come together to create and promote more opportunities for the UK. And where better than London International Shipping Week in September. While the eyes of all maritime nations are upon us to bring together the champions of maritime industries to set out how we will achieve our shared vision of a modern, open, commercial maritime sector. Staffed by professional, dedicated and highly skilled people. And part of a growing, quality flags. Which once again will rule the waves. Government should know its limits; so only do what is desirable in the cause of virtue and wouldn’t be done otherwise. Much of what I have set out today will only be achieved by the sector; those who know best in the professions of the maritime world, working with ministers. While I have a voice in government what I can say is that you have a champion to work for you and fight for you, inspired by our seafaring past, excited by our maritime present and relentlessly ambitious for its future. Thank you."

/guidance/wreck-and-salvage-law,"Wreck and salvage laws, the role of the Receiver of the Wreck, wreck owners and salvors and how to report wreck material. Wreck and salvage law Protected sites and species Marine Maritime and Coastguard Agency There are thousands of wrecked vessels and aircraft around the UK coast. Many wreck sites are protected for their historic importance or because they are considered dangerous. If you recover wreck material within UK territorial waters, or bring wreck material into UK territorial waters, you must report it to the Receiver of Wreck. This guide explains the roles and responsibilities of the Receiver of Wreck and the law relating to wreck and salvage. You will also find information about the responsibilities and rights of wreck owners and salvors, and how to report wreck material. There are also contact details for organisations that can provide help, advice and information on wrecks. Responsibilities of the Receiver of Wreck In the UK, the Receiver of Wreck administers the Merchant Shipping Act 1995 in relation to wreck and salvage. The Receiver is appointed directly by the Secretary of State and the post of Receiver of Wreck currently sits within the Maritime and Coastguard Agency ( MCA ). The Receiver is responsible for processing incoming reports of wreck and ensures that the interests of both salvor and owner are taken into consideration by: researching and establishing who owns the wreck liaising with the finder and owner, and other interested parties such as archaeologists and museums Definition of wreck According to section 255 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1995, the definition of wreck includes “jetsam, flotsam, lagan and derelict found in or on the shores of the sea or any tidal water”. Jetsam, flotsam, lagan and derelict Jetsam describes goods cast overboard to lighten a vessel in danger of sinking. The vessel may still perish. Flotsam describes goods lost from a ship which has sunk or otherwise perished. Goods are recoverable because they remain afloat. Lagan describes goods cast overboard from a ship which afterwards perishes. The goods are buoyed so they can be recovered. Derelict describes property, whether vessel or cargo, which has been abandoned and deserted at sea by those who were in charge of it without any hope of recovering it. If a boat comes off its moorings, it isn’t generally classified as a wreck for the purposes of the Merchant Shipping Act 1995, as it hasn’t been abandoned without hope of recovery. Also, buoys such as data buoys and mooring buoys aren’t classed as wreck. However, buoys which form part of fishing equipment may be classed as wreck when adrift. The Receiver’s remit and duties The Receiver’s remit is set down in the Merchant Shipping Act 1995, Part IX. This covers wreck from UK territorial waters, and wreck brought into the UK from outside UK territorial waters. The Receiver’s remit extends to tidal waters in the UK, so it doesn’t cover lakes or rivers beyond tidal reach. The Receiver aims to give owners the opportunity of having their property returned and to make sure a fair salvage award payment is made where necessary. The Receiver will also recover any costs paid from the public purse during this process. The Receiver is required to notify Lloyds of recovered property considered to be worth more than £5,000. The duties and rights of the salvor If you recover wreck material, you must declare it to the Receiver. Finders should report their recoveries by submitting a completed Report of wreck and salvage form within 28 days of the recovery. You should give a full description of the wreck and will usually be asked to hold recovered material to the Receiver’s order. The duties and rights of wreck owners If you own a wreck, you must prove ownership to the satisfaction of the Receiver where wreck material has been recovered and reported. You must provide proof of ownership within one year of the material being reported. You will be entitled to have your property back as soon as you have paid any due expenses and an appropriate salvage award. Unclaimed wreck If wreck from UK waters remains unclaimed at the end of one year, it becomes the property of the Crown or grantee of the Crown such as the Duchy of Cornwall. If you believe you are entitled to unclaimed wreck, you must provide evidence of entitlement to the satisfaction of the Receiver. If wreck from UK territorial waters is unclaimed at the end of one year, the Receiver will dispose of the find on behalf of the Crown. If wreck from outside UK territorial waters is unclaimed at the end of one year, the Crown makes no claim. Salvage awards A salvor, acting properly under the law, is likely to be entitled to a salvage award. This salvage award cannot exceed the salved value of the recovered material. The Receiver can arrange for independent valuations to help owners and finders agree on a fair salvage award. Other factors are also taken into account when determining salvage awards, including: the measure of success obtained by the salvor the skills and efforts of the salvor the nature and degree of danger Wreck law The Receiver of Wreck is responsible for enforcing the Merchant Shipping Act 1995 in relation to wreck and salvage and actively monitors diving and salvage activities as well as informing and educating sea users of their responsibilities. Some wrecks are also covered by other pieces of legislation including the Protection of Wrecks Act 1973 or the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986. The Receiver works closely with other government departments and heritage organisations involved in matters related to wreck. The Respect our Wrecks initiative is a PADI, BSAC and SAA initiative supported by the Receiver. It highlights the concern for sensitive and correct behaviour by all divers when visiting wreck sites. These organisations have also signed a Memorandum of Understanding to implement best practice in matters of wreck. The law relating to wreck In the UK, there are three main laws which apply to shipwrecks: Merchant Shipping Act 1995 Protection of Wrecks Act 1973 Protection of Military Remains Act 1986 Depending on where the wreck site is, the Ancient Monuments & Archaeological Areas Act 1979 may also apply. Merchant Shipping Act 1995 Under the Merchant Shipping Act 1995, you must report to the Receiver of Wreck all wreck material recovered from UK territorial waters and any wreck material brought into the UK from outside UK territorial waters. This includes: wreck material found in or on the sea wreck material washed ashore in tidal waters material recovered from a wreck site - regardless of age, size or apparent importance or value When you report recovered wreck material to the Receiver, you may be entitled to a salvage award. Protection of Wrecks Act 1973 Section 1 of the Protection of Wrecks Act 1973 is designed to protect wrecks which are of historic, archaeological or artistic importance. This is administered by National Heritage organisations on behalf of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport ( DCMS ). When a wreck is protected under this legislation, there is a protected area around the designated site and diving is prohibited unless an appropriate licence has been issued by the relevant National Heritage Agency. Section 2 of the Protection of Wrecks Act covers wrecks considered as being potentially dangerous and is administered by the Receiver of Wreck through the MCA . In the interest of safety, there is a strict no-entry policy for wrecks considered dangerous because of their contents. These wrecks have a prohibited area around them. Protection of Military Remains Act 1986 The Protection of Military Remains Act 1986 deals with wrecks of both aircraft and ships, and all military aircraft is automatically protected under this legislation. This act is administered by the Ministry of Defence ( MOD ) - RAF for aircraft, Navy for vessels. Under this act, vessels may be designated either as a protected place or as a controlled site. Divers may visit a protected place on a ‘look but don’t touch’ basis, however they are prohibited from visiting controlled sites. The process of reporting wreck Under the Merchant Shipping Act 1995, you must report to the Receiver of Wreck all wreck material (regardless of size or significance) recovered from within UK territorial waters - up to the 12 nautical mile limit - or recovered outside the UK and brought within UK territorial waters. Reporting wreck is a simple process. You just need to complete a Report of wreck and salvage form and send it to the Receiver of Wreck. Wreck material can take many forms, including: portholes bells compasses fixtures and fittings personal belongings cargo material aircraft medieval pots, gold coins, cannon etc If wreck material comes from non-tidal waters, it is treated as if it was found on land and falls under other legislation, such as the Treasure Act 1996, or the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979. Settlement of salvage When you report a find - whether modern or historic material - to the Receiver, you may be entitled to a salvage award. Settlement of ownership When you report wreck material to the Receiver, wreck owners are given the opportunity to be reunited with their property, and the salvor may receive a salvage award. Find out who owns wreck items The Receiver investigates ownership of wreck items. If you find wreck, you should assume that it has an owner, for example: an individual a company or insurance company a dive club the MOD or the Department for Transport ( DfT ) An owner has one year after the Report Form is received in which to come forward and prove ownership of the property. During this time, the finder is normally allowed to hold the wreck on indemnity to the Receiver of Wreck. If an owner decides that they would like their property returned, they will first have to settle salvage with the legal finder of the material. Historic wreck material When material of historical or archaeological importance is reported, the Receiver may seek further advice from experts in a related field. For wreck material that is of historical or archaeological importance, the Receiver of Wreck will try to ensure that it is offered to an appropriate museum. If you find historic wreck material, your views will be taken into consideration when placing the material in a museum and you may still be entitled to a salvage award. Fees and forms The Receiver doesn’t currently charge a fee, but will expect to recover any expenses incurred such as storage or obtaining a valuation of the salved property. If you recover any wreck material, you’ll need to complete a Report of wreck and salvage form and send it to the Receiver within 28 days of the recovery. Both you and a witness should sign a hard copy of the form before returning it to the Receiver. Receiver of Wreck - enforcement and penalties The Receiver of Wreck tries to ensure the fair treatment of both legal salvors and legal owners. They also expect all sea and coast users to abide by the law when recovering wreck. The Receiver will investigate any report of possible offences regarding the treatment of wreck. If the investigation reveals sufficient evidence, the Receiver may prosecute those suspected of having committed an offence. The Receiver may share information with other prosecuting authorities, for instance, when offences come to light in relation to the Theft Act 1968 or the Firearms Act 1968. Summary of offences and penalties Under the Merchant Shipping Act 1995, there are offences for illegal activity which carry penalties, for example: S.236 - failing to declare a wreck find without a reasonable excuse carries a £2,500 fine on summary conviction, plus loss of salvage rights, and payment of twice the value of the find to the person entitled to the wreck S.237 - concealing or keeping possession of wreck or cargo and refusing to surrender it carries a £2,500 fine on summary conviction S.245 - taking undeclared wreck from UK waters into a foreign port and selling it carries a maximum of five years’ imprisonment on indictment S.246 (1) - boarding a vessel in distress without permission of master carries a £1,000 fine on summary conviction S.246 (3) - impeding or hindering attempts to save a vessel, concealing any wreck, defacing or obliterating any mark, and wrongfully carrying away or removing any wreck carries a £2,500 fine on summary conviction Time limit for declaring recovered wreck material The Receiver considers that 28 days is a reasonable time for a finder to declare wreck by completing and submitting a Report of wreck and salvage form . If you recover wreck material and require more time to declare it, you can apply to the Receiver in writing, giving details of the reasons why. However, if a find is not registered within 28 days, or a request for an extension is considered unreasonable, the Receiver may, without further notification, commence proceedings under section 236(2). Monitoring diving activities Where possible the Receiver monitors diving activities in conjunction with Ministry of Defence, Police, Coastguard, Diving Organisations and other interested parties, and will continue to educate all sea-users through leaflets, presentations and visits. Protected wrecks Around the coast of the UK there are more than 100 wreck sites designated as protected wrecks by one of three main pieces of legislation: Protection of Wrecks Act 1973 Protection of Military Remains Act 1986 Ancient Monuments & Archaeological Areas Act 1979 Section 1 of the Protection of Wrecks Act 1973 Section 1 of the Protection of Wrecks Act 1973 provides protection for designated wrecks which are deemed to be important by virtue of their historical, archaeological or artistic value. List of protected wrecks designated under Section 1 of the Protection of Wrecks Act 1973 . Diving at these sites is prohibited unless an appropriate licence has been issued by the relevant National Heritage Agency. There are 4 levels of licence: visitor licence survey licence surface recovery licence excavation licence The administration of Section 1 of this Act and associated licences is the responsibility of: Historic England in England Historic Scotland in Scotland Cadw in Wales Environment and Heritage Service in Northern Ireland Section 2 of the Protection of Wrecks Act 1973 Section 2 of the Protection of Wrecks Act provides protection for wrecks that are designated as dangerous because of their contents. It is administered by the Receiver of Wreck through the MCA . Diving on these wrecks is strictly prohibited. The Protection of Military Remains Act 1986 The Protection of Military Remains Act 1986 makes it an offence to interfere without a licence with the wreckage of any crashed, sunken or stranded military aircraft or designated vessel. This is irrespective of loss of life or whether the loss occurred during peacetime or wartime. You can find wrecks designated as military remains on the Legislation.gov website . Download guidance for the recovery of crashed military aircraft (PDF, 63KB) . All crashed military aircraft receive automatic protection, but vessels must be individually designated. Wrecked vessels are protected under this Act both in UK waters and abroad. There are two levels of protection offered by this Act, designation as a protected place or as a controlled site. Protected places The designation of protected places includes the remains of any aircraft which crashed while in military service or any vessel which sank or stranded in military service after 4 August 1914. Although crashed military aircraft receive automatic status as a protected place, vessels need to be specifically designated by name. The location of the wreck does not need to be known for it to be designated as a protected place. You are allowed to dive on an aircraft or vessel designated as a protected place, on a ‘look but do not touch’ basis only, however it is an offence to: conduct unlicensed diving or salvage operations tamper with, damage, remove or unearth any remains enter any hatch or other opening Controlled sites Controlled sites are specifically designated areas which cover the remains of a military aircraft or a vessel sunk or stranded in military service within the last 200 years. Within a controlled site, diving operations are prohibited unless you are authorised by a specific licence. It is also an offence to: conduct diving, salvage or excavation operations for the purposes of investigating or recording the remains tamper with, damage, move or unearth any remains enter any hatch or opening You can obtain further information on this Act and its administration by contacting the MOD . Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979 The Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979 relates primarily to land-based sites and structures and provides for the scheduling of monuments of national importance. In recent years, this act has also been used to provide some level of protection for underwater sites. Once a wreck has been scheduled a maritime monument, public access to it - ie diving on the site - is permitted on a ‘look but do not touch’ basis. Without scheduled monument consent, it is an offence to: demolish destroy alter or repair For this reason, only suitably robust sites are likely to be scheduled, such as the remains of the German High Seas Fleet at Scapa Flow. Contact the relevant National Heritage Agency for further information. Other types of protected wrecks There are restrictions on other wrecks not covered by the legislation above, for example by harbour authorities or by directives issued by the Secretary of State’s representative for maritime salvage and intervention. You can find the most up-to-date list of protected wrecks by contacting the appropriate authority. Any artefact that is recovered from a protected wreck site under licence to the Secretary of State must still be reported to the Receiver of Wreck.

/government/news/government-announces-updated-coastguard-reforms,"Modernisation proposals announced for coastguard stations. Government announces updated coastguard reforms  Department for Transport Maritime and Coastguard Agency Coastguard stations will be better coordinated and more resilient to the challenges of the coming decades under updated modernisation proposals announced today (14 July 2011) by Transport Secretary Philip Hammond. The coastguard has been helping to manage our seas and protect those who use them for over two centuries. However, the service has undergone few changes over the past forty years and is now in need of modernisation as the current structure is not sufficiently resilient and fluctuating workloads cannot be properly distributed. The government launched a consultation in December 2010 on modernisation proposals designed to address these issues and provide enhanced career opportunities for coastguard officers. There were a total of over 1,800 responses to the consultation and while these reflected a general acceptance that change and modernisation is necessary, they also expressed concerns over a potential loss of local knowledge and a perceived weakening of operational relationships. The government’s updated proposals reflect these responses and propose creating a nationally networked system of coastguard stations comprising: 1 maritime operations centre in the Southampton/Portsmouth area with a back-up facility at the existing Dover site which will be retained as a 24 hour centre 8 sub-centres, all operated on a 24 hour basis, located at Falmouth, Milford Haven, Holyhead, Belfast, Stornoway, Shetland, Aberdeen and Humber. The small station at London is also retained. Previously the government had proposed establishing 2 maritime operations centres (in the Southampton/Portsmouth area and Aberdeen) and 5 sub-centres, operating in daylight hours only, as well as retaining the 24 hour centre at Dover which oversees English Channel activity. Transport Secretary Philip Hammond said: We have been clear that modernisation is required to deliver a resilient coastguard service, fit for the 21st century. But we have always been open to debate about how that should be achieved. This has been a genuine consultation that has seen a high level of engagement and many well-thought out responses - including specific alternative proposals. It is clear from the responses that there is huge public and political admiration for the work of our coastguard, a clear consensus that change and modernisation is necessary, but also some specific concerns about the original proposals. Our updated proposals will ensure the safety of seafarers and coastal communities, delivering the modernised and more cost-effective service we need for the 21st century, while also responding to the concerns raised during the consultation process. Under existing arrangements, neighbouring stations are ‘paired’, allowing them to provide back-up to one another when needed. Today’s announcement means that one station in each pair is retained. Under today’s proposals the coastguard stations at Clyde, Forth, Portland, Liverpool, Yarmouth, Brixham, Thames and Swansea would close progressively over the period 2012 to 2014/15. The station at Solent will be replaced by a new maritime operations centre in the Portsmouth/Southampton area. There will now be the opportunity for people to comment on those elements of today’s announcement which differ from the original proposals. These will be the subject of a further period of consultation, which will run for twelve weeks ending on 6 October 2011. Further information Detail of today decisions In detail, the government has concluded: that it is right to continue with proposals for a nationally networked system with the introduction of 1 maritime operations centre ( MOC ) capable of managing incidents anywhere and ensuring optimum distribution of workload across the system that establishing 1 MOC , rather than the 2 previously proposed, allows us to address concerns over local knowledge and the robustness of the future concept of operations by retaining one of each of the current ‘paired’ stations with the retained centres operating as part of the nationally networked system 24 hours a day rather than during daytime only - staff in each of the current ‘pair’ of stations are already familiar with, and frequently exercise, taking calls and managing incidents in an adjacent area that the Northern Ireland Coastguard centre at Bangor should be retained because of the specific requirement to manage the civil contingency arrangements unique to Northern Ireland and the relationship with search and rescue partners in the Irish Republic with whom we coordinate closely in air sea rescues in the waters around Ireland that, in light of the decision to retain 1 station from each pair, and concerns about Welsh language communication, the Holyhead station, rather than the one at Liverpool should be retained that, in response to concerns expressed over the resilience of infrastructure and communication links within the Scottish Islands and with the Scottish mainland, coastguard centres in both Stornoway and Shetland should be retained that, in the light of a further review of the potential costs of vacating the existing sites in Swansea and Milford Haven which has shown that there are no financial reasons to favour either location, and in view of the department’s substantial levels of employment in Swansea, the coastguard centre at Milford Haven rather than the centre at Swansea should be retained A review of all the responses to the consultation launched in December 2010 has been produced under the leadership of a Non-Executive Director of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, involving a number of serving coastguard officers and members of the PCS union. This has been placed in the Library of the House of Commons and can be found on the Maritime and Coastguard website. The consultation document on the updated proposals may be found at the Maritime and Coastguard Agency website. [Contact:1017]"

/government/news/maritime-growth-study-evidence-published-to-boost-british-competitiveness,"Shipping Minister Robert Goodwill welcomes milestone as major report continues into Britain’s maritime industries. Maritime Growth Study evidence published to boost British competitiveness  Department for Transport Maritime and Coastguard Agency Reforms and ideas to drive the UK’s position as a leading maritime nation have been published today, Thursday 16 July. The work will be used by the chair of the Maritime Growth Study , Lord Mountevans, as he examines how Britain’s maritime industries can build on their multi-billion pound contribution to the economy. The results of an industry consultation are now available on GOV.UK alongside an independent report into the international competitiveness of the UK maritime sector . A report commissioned by Maritime and Coastguard Agency has also been published. This report provides an industry perspective on the performance of the UK Ship Register and gives recommendations on how it can become more internationally competitive, subsequently boosting the number of ships flying the UK Flag. Shipping minister Robert Goodwill said: The publication of this evidence base represents a major milestone in the Maritime Growth Study. I am impressed by the broad range of contributors and the quality of material submitted to the study. The government is committed to supporting a competitive and world leading UK maritime sector and I look forward to receiving Lord Mountevans’ findings later this year, underpinned by this evidence. Chris Thomas, MCA Acting Director of Maritime Safety and Standards, said: I’d like to thank our industrious panel members for their contributions. Their hard work will give us the direction we need to improve the UK Ship Register and, of course, have provided the Maritime Growth Study with invaluable background information. The Maritime Growth Study is chaired by Lord Mountevans, and supported by an advisory group of leading industry figures. The final report will be published in September during London International Shipping Week. [Contact:1017]"

/government/speeches/the-growth-of-the-uks-maritime-industries,"Shipping Minister Robert Goodwill welcomes the publication of the Maritime Growth Study. The growth of the UK’s maritime industries  Maritime and Coastguard Agency Department for Transport I am delighted to announce the publication of Lord Mountevans’ Maritime Growth Study , on the first day (7 September 2015) of London International Shipping Week 2015. It’s fitting that we are meeting in the Brunel and Smeaton rooms. John Smeaton and Isambard Kingdom Brunel are giants of Britain’s maritime past. Together responsible for the design of many ships, lighthouses and harbours. A towering legacy. Yet if we learn anything from them, it’s not just the need to remember past maritime successes. But the need to focus on the future. And that is why we commissioned the Maritime Growth Study. The first study of its kind for more than 15 years. A complete review of the strength of the UK’s maritime industries An analysis of how well we fare against our competitors, and how we should aim to contribute to the growth in world sea trade. The world has changed significantly since the last time the government undertook a review of this kind. Manufacturing has gone east. Ships grow ever larger. Aviation plays a bigger role in moving goods. But one thing will never change. And that’s the vital importance of the UK’s maritime industry. Directly, it adds at least £11 billion a year to the UK economy. And indirectly, it supports every type of commerce, every job, every business in these islands. But that doesn’t mean we aren’t facing competition from overseas. Other maritime centres in Europe and the far east are experiencing rapid growth, and seeking to replicate our success. This report makes some important recommendations as to how we can keep ahead. To strengthen leadership by the government and in the industry. To improve promotion. And support the workforce. The government will consider these recommendations carefully. Where we need to take action, we will. And I can already announce some changes we’ll be making in response to the study. First, the Secretary of State for Transport will convene and chair a Ministerial Working Group for Maritime Growth. The working group will increase UK exports and productivity through better collaboration with our maritime industries. Second, the Maritime and Coastguard Agency will give more independence to the UK Ship Register , allowing it greater commercial flexibility. This will include the appointment of a new director to lead the register and deliver improvements in service. And third, we will also look at the case for reforms to the MCA itself, so it can better compete with other successful international ship registers. That’s some of what the government will be doing. But the report also makes recommendations to the industry. Such as the need to establish a single, industry-wide promotional body to work with government; not only to raise its domestic profile, but to market the UK abroad as the place for maritime business. So in conclusion, I am immensely grateful to Lord Mountevans for his chairmanship of the project. Jeffrey’s leadership and experience has made a compelling case for the future of the UK maritime industry. I now invite Lord Mountevans to say a few words himself. Thank you."

Major maritime report launched as London International Shipping Week gets underway  Closed organisation: Department for Business, Innovation & Skills Department for Transport HM Treasury Ministry of Defence Wales Office Maritime and Coastguard Agency A major report examining how to maximise Britain’s potential as a maritime nation is published today, (7 September 2015), marking the first day of London International Shipping Week 2015. The study led by Lord Mountevans, Chairman of Maritime UK, examined how Britain can build on the success of an industry that contributes at least £11 billion to the UK economy annually and supports more than 113,000 jobs and 6,600 businesses. Recommendations in the study include: the establishment of a ministerial working group in government to drive forward action on maritime issues, set clear targets and monitor progress creating a new standalone unit within the Maritime and Coastguard Agency to focus on attracting more ships to be British registered and fly the Red Ensign government and industry to develop a joint strategy to identify skills gaps and increase apprenticeships i‎n the UK maritime sector and increase apprenticeships the creation of a single industry body to promote the UK maritime sector to international markets Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said: “London International Shipping Week is an opportunity to remind the world of the benefits Britain offers, whether it’s our world-leading ports, maritime business services or skilled workforce. We are determined to grow our share of the global maritime sector, helping talented people find careers in its industries and attracting companies to do business in the UK. “Our maritime history is something Britain can be proud of, but the sector is taking us into the future. I want Britain to feel the benefit of its international reputation by driving economic growth and increasing jobs. We have already seen millions invested in the UK, including at London Gateway and Liverpool - demonstrating the central place Britain already holds in the industry. “I thank the chair who has produced an important piece of work and look forward to working with industry to ensure we do all we can to keep Britain a great maritime nation.” Chair of the Maritime Growth Study Lord Mountevans said: “I am a passionate believer in the importance of the maritime sector to our island trading nation, and very aware of the reliance of the rest of the world on our diverse maritime cluster. “This report is the culmination of months of work involving widespread engagement and detailed research. I am very grateful to all those who have engaged in the study. “The result is a ‘call to arms’ to industry and government to actively support and raise the profile of a vital sector that contributes significantly to the economy and which the nation relies on to meet its daily needs.” The report launches London International Shipping Week 2015, which runs from 7 to 11 September.

/government/speeches/the-importance-of-britains-maritime-pilots,"Sea trade is set to grow, and the UK's maritime pilots will help secure that growth. The importance of Britain's maritime pilots  Maritime and Coastguard Agency Department for Transport Introduction Good morning. It is a pleasure to join you on this historic ship, whose role in the North Atlantic convoys reminds us of how seafarers have served our country in the past. As some of you may know, I am the proud owner of a historic vessel myself. The MV Coronia - one of the little ships that saw service at Dunkirk. She rescued 900 men that day, making 3 runs to and from the French beaches. And today she works the Yorkshire coast offering short cruises to the people of Scarborough. But just as importantly, she gives me a direct stake in our maritime sector. So this morning I want share some of my hopes for our industry. But first, let us remember the things that already make British maritime great. Our world leading maritime business services. Our prestigious flag. Our skilled workforce. Our competitive tax regime. And our safe, efficient and successful ports, in which our pilots play the central role. In conditions like these, our maritime sector should grow and thrive. The opportunity of world trade For centuries, sea trade has defined our way of life on this island, and in recent times it has helped lift millions out of poverty around the world. Today, over 80% of global trade is moved by sea. And by 2030, sea trade is predicted to double. With trade so reliant on the maritime sector, our challenge is a good one. How do we prepare for this growth? That was the question we asked when we commissioned the ‘ Maritime Growth Study ’ a year ago. When it was published in September, the report made some important recommendations; such as that we need to strengthen leadership, promote the industry, and support the workforce. The government is now carefully considering how we can best put these recommendations into effect. And ahead of our formal response, change is already under-way - the Maritime and Coastguard Agency is being reformed to support our ambition to see more ships joining the UK Ship Register. The role of government But if there is one thing we can learn from maritime history, it is that governments do best when they give the market the freedom to do its job. We must guard against protectionism, and overzealous regulation. We must promote competition, while doing what is necessary to ensure our seafarers are well trained, and enjoy a safe environment in which to work. And for that, we must work together. I commend the guidance your Association has developed, with North P&I Club insurance, on the exchange of information that takes place every time a pilot boards a ship. And I am glad that representatives from ports and shipping, including Captain Don Cockrill, the Association’s Chairman, are reviewing the ‘ Port Marine Safety Code ’ and its ‘ guide to good practice ’ to make sure the code and the guide are as clear and as effective as possible. I agree with Captain Cockrill’s suggestion that the new version of the code must include advice on resolving maritime disagreements. Maritime skills And as global sea trade grows, we need more seafarers; Deck Officers, Engineering Officers, Chief Mates and Masters, many of whom may develop their careers as the pilots of tomorrow. So I am excited about the UK Global Maritime Knowledge Hub that will be sited at Wirral Waters. The Hub is a new addition to the UK’s maritime training institutions, of which we already have the greatest concentration in Europe, doing world-class research and providing respected qualifications - and it will grow the UK’s Maritime skills base. I’m also delighted that Associated British Ports is inviting applications for its Marine Pilotage apprenticeship programme. And by the work of Port Skills and Safety to develop a marine pilot certificate to help ports and pilots record their training and skills. These are vital investments in training for this critical role on which our ports depend. Meanwhile, through the £15 million support for maritime training fund , this government continues to invest in training for officers and ratings. The fund contributes significantly towards the cost of Merchant Navy training, as well as supporting existing seafarers who seek to qualify as officers. International regulation But no speech on shipping would be complete without touching on the international nature of the sector. The world needs international shipping, and that means governments must work together. Radically different rules for different parts of the world rarely make sense. Rival regulatory regimes tend to increase cost and inefficiency. So we must ensure that in the years ahead we support effective international law. And I believe that the International Maritime Organization is the right forum for those efforts. And while action from regional bodies to open world markets and support free trade should be welcomed, we must always seek global action to produce a level playing field and avoid the distortions of regionally derived rules. Conclusion So, in conclusion. In recent decades, the maritime sector has shown its spirit of innovation and enterprise. We will depend on that spirit in coming decades, too. Governments can play their part, but they can never exceed the ingenuity of those who work in the industry - on land or sea or both - to deliver safety, prosperity and opportunity for us all. Thank you."

/guidance/support-for-maritime-training-smart,"Support for maritime training (SMarT) funding is available for merchant navy training until March 2016. Support for maritime training (SMarT)  Maritime and Coastguard Agency Background The Government’s Support for Maritime Training (SMarT) scheme has been running since April 1998 and supports courses approved by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) and the Merchant Navy Training Board (MNTB) for the training of officers, officer cadets and ratings. The Government’s principal objective in supporting merchant navy training is to facilitate an adequate supply of UK maritime expertise to meet the nation’s economic and strategic requirements. SMarT is currently administered on behalf of the MCA by MaTSU, an independent unit of Ricardo-AEA. The budget is held by MCA, whilst MaTSU provides the funding direct to training providers and conducts audits to ensure compliance. Initially there were five SMarT categories (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). These funded training towards a first and second certificate of competency, watch rating training and also rating to officer conversions and conversions from STCW ‘78 to STCW ‘78, as amended (‘95). More information can be found in MGN 455 (M) . In financial year 2011 to 2012 following an announcement by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport (Mike Penning) the SMarT categories were rationalized to just three categories SMarT 1, 3 and 5. A fixed annual budget of £12 million was announced until 31 March 2015 to support maritime training. The majority of this money was focused on supporting initial training for cadets studying at junior officer level (SMarT 1). On 9 September 2013 the Transport Secretary, Mr Patrick McLoughlin, announced that the SMarT budget, over the Spending Review period to the end of March 2016, would receive an increase of up to £3 million a year. This is in recognition of the importance of sustaining the UK’s skills base for this important sector. This has enabled the reintroduction of SMarT 2 and increased the scope of SMarT 3 funding to help with the costs of additional ancillary training courses. There are currently four categories of SMarT (1, 2, 3 and 5), more information can be found in MGN 455 (M) , MIN 466 (M) and MIN 486 (M) . Who can claim? SMarT coversup to 50% of actual training costs and is paid to the training providers (shipping companies) who sponsor the trainees, not to individuals or colleges. SMarT funding is available for MNTB and MCA approved merchant training programmes and centres. Eligible Shipping Companies (TPs) must apply to become a TP within SMarT before they are able to claim for eligible trainees. Unemployed seafarers wishing to train as either a Rating or who is a Rating and wishes to become an Officer, may apply for funding through the Merchant Navy Training Provider.

/government/speeches/government-response-to-maritime-growth-study,"Explains progress being made following publication of the 'Maritime growth study: keeping the UK competitive in a global market' report. Government response to maritime growth study  Maritime and Coastguard Agency Department for Transport In November 2014, the Department for Transport launched a comprehensive study, chaired by Lord Jeffrey Mountevans, now Lord Mayor of the City of London, into maintaining the UK’s status as a world-leading maritime centre. The ‘Maritime growth study: keeping the UK competitive in a global market’ was published on 7 September 2015, the opening day of London International Shipping Week 2015, with a commitment from government to formally respond to the report by the end of the year. The last such review took place nearly 2 decades ago and the global economic landscape has changed significantly since then. However, one constant has been the continuing contribution of UK maritime and marine industries to our economy and in keeping seaborne trade moving worldwide. The study highlights that this has been achieved through a highly advanced, world-class maritime cluster spread across the nation that attracts investment and exports services worldwide. The sector’s direct economic contribution is at least £11 billion, while directly supporting at least 113,000 jobs and 6,600 businesses. The UK is truly a ‘one-stop-shop’ for the global maritime market, but the study concludes that there is still much more that it can achieve. The report recognises that other maritime centres in Europe and the Far East are experiencing rapid growth and seeking to replicate our success. Government and industry must therefore work together to reinforce the UK’s role in the global market and put our nation in the best possible position to exploit the expected doubling in world sea trade by 2030. A successful maritime sector will support the government’s commitment to enhancing domestic productivity, rebalancing the UK economy, increasing exports and raising our global status. The study involved extensive engagement and independent research to inform and shape its conclusions and recommendations. The process also benefitted from the scrutiny and support of an industry advisory group chaired by Michael Parker, Chairman of the UK arm of global shipping company, CMA-CGM, and comprising senior business leaders from across the sector. The report encompasses Lord Mountevans’ recommendations for government and industry, focusing on 4 themes in particular; government leadership, industry leadership, the need for a skilled workforce and the opportunities for marketing maritime UK. The government welcomes his findings and will take forward the recommendations in all 4 of these areas, partnering with and involving industry as required. Significant progress is already being made. A new ministerial working group for maritime growth has been established to drive growth and tackle issues impacting the sector. The working group, including representatives from industry, met for the first time last month to discuss items on maritime inward investment and export growth, as well as the opportunities presented by the government’s proposed reform of apprenticeships. The working group will be supported by a committee that will bring together senior officials from key departments with an interest in maritime in the New Year to identify what further action is required. Officials will shortly begin the process of updating the government’s assessment of the seafarer requirement in the UK maritime sector so we have the most up-to-date picture of supply and demand. This will ultimately inform the chair’s recommended review of our support for maritime training ( SMarT ) scheme to ensure it remains fit for purpose. A key focus of the study was the role played by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency ( MCA ) administered UK Ship Register. The register has now seen nearly 12 months of modest, but continuous growth in gross tonnage. However, we will not be complacent about this success and fully support Lord Mountevans’ ambitions for the register, which were informed by evidence from the independent UK Ship Register advisory panel. In addition to the agency’s existing plans for creating a more efficient, flexible and customer-focused survey and inspection function, I am pleased to be able to announce the appointment of Simon Barham as Director of the UK Ship Register. Simon brings a wealth of commercial shipping experience to the role and will begin the process of making the Register more independent from the MCA ’s regulatory functions when he starts in 2016. These improvements are being implemented against the backdrop of longer term work by the department exploring the scope for more significant reform of relevant MCA services, in particular the UK Ship Register. While the specific recommendations for industry are for them to consider and respond to, the outcomes being sought, including greater coordination to promote the sector as a whole, are vital to achieving the chair’s vision for maritime. The government is happy to support industry in this endeavour. I am grateful to Lord Mountevans for his chairmanship of the project. His leadership and experience have helped to produce a compelling report on a sophisticated sector consisting of multiple markets and industries. He played an important role in successfully corralling the views of an expansive and diverse industry with varying interests. It is now for government and industry to work in partnership to lever the findings from the study and keep the UK maritime sector at the forefront of the global market. The report, Maritime growth study: keeping the UK competitive in a global market can be found on GOV.UK and copies were made available in the libraries of the House on its publication in September."

Government commits to action on driving maritime growth  Department for Transport Maritime and Coastguard Agency The Minister of State for Transport Robert Goodwill laid out the government’s response to the maritime growth study today (16 December 2015). The Shipping and Ports Minister committed to taking steps to drive growth in the maritime sector, encouraging greater investment and making the UK flag more attractive to ship owners. Training is also a key focus with pledges to identify skills gaps, support maritime education and promote the wide range of careers in the sector. The government has committed to taking forward recommendations made in the study including establishing a ministerial working group to tackle key issues in the sector and identify opportunities for future growth. The group met for the first time in November 2015. The DfT will also undertake a fresh look at how many seafarers are needed for the future, and work to improve career opportunities including a review of the government’s support for maritime training ( SMarT ) scheme. The study called for reform of the UK Ship Register to create a more commercial focus and encourage more ships to fly the world-famous Red Ensign. This has already begun with the announcement today of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency’s appointment of a new director of the UK Ship Register. Minister of State for Transport Robert Goodwill said: “The maritime industry is a success story for our nation, and we are determined that the UK grows as a major international shipping country. We face strong competition across the world and it is vital we stay ahead of the curve. “That is why the publication of the maritime growth study earlier this year was an important milestone and we are already acting on the recommendations. “We will continue to offer our full support to industry, and together we can continue to build on the UK ’s proud maritime history.” The UK ’s maritime sector currently contributes at least £11 billion to the economy each year, and supports around 113,000 jobs and 6,600 businesses.

/government/speeches/the-uks-new-search-and-rescue-helicopter-base-at-prestwick,"UK government has put £2 billion into search and rescue and has spent over £70 million of that on facilities and helicopters at Prestwick.   The UK's new search and rescue helicopter base at Prestwick  Maritime and Coastguard Agency Department for Transport Thank you for inviting me to lead celebrations for the launch of the UK’s search and rescue helicopter service here in Prestwick. Today (18 December 2015) we mark a historic occasion; the passing of search and rescue operations from the British military to Bristow Helicopters Ltd, operating on behalf of Her Majesty’s Coastguard. I would like to start by paying tribute to the Royal Navy’s search and rescue unit at HMS Gannet. From 1 January, the unit will stand down responsibility for search and rescue duties and will hand that responsibility over to the Bristow crew here at Prestwick. The UK government is very grateful for the lifesaving work you have done since HMS Gannett was established here in Prestwick in 1971, and will continue to do until the end of the year. It cannot be overstated how much we all appreciate the vital work of the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force search and rescue helicopter crews and engineers. For over 60 years, you have worked around the clock in all weathers to rescue tens of thousands of people, and in doing so have saved many lives. You have set the bar for search and rescue very high indeed. It now falls to Bristow to continue to clear that high bar. And after the response to the recent flooding, when new Bristow aircraft from Caernarfon and Humberside joined forces with the Sea King from HMS Gannet to rescue people in danger, I am confident that Bristow will do their search and rescue forerunners very proud. Of course, Bristow has been rendering search and rescue services to Her Majesty’s Government for over 30 years. And that service will continue here in Prestwick and in 9 other places around the UK. Your job is the single-minded pursuit of saving lives. You will work with the best technology. The best aircraft. And the finest, most well-trained, and dedicated people the world of search and rescue has to offer. Many people here today will be based at this facility and have joined from other parts of Bristow’s SAR operations. Others have taken the decision to leave behind their military careers to stay with search and rescue. And still others are volunteers. I am very proud to speak on behalf of the whole of Her Majesty’s government when I express our gratitude for the daring and endeavour of those who go out in all weathers, night or day, at a moment’s notice, to bring people in danger safely back to dry land and their homes and families, or indeed to, sadly, have to recover the bodies of those lost at sea. Of course, the crews could not do their jobs but for the highly-skilled engineers and support staff also here today. I know that everyone will carry out their jobs with the utmost professionalism and commitment to their task. And in doing so, you will be working with some magnificent machines. As minister responsible for Her Majesty’s Coastguard, I am delighted to see these wonderful Sikorsky aircraft bearing HM Coastguard livery. Sikorsky has provided search and rescue helicopters for coastguard operations since 1983, starting with the Sikorsky S61s which operated from the coastguard base in Shetland. Over 20 state-of-the-art aircraft like the ones you see here today are already operating throughout the UK as part of our new UK search and rescue helicopter service, operated and maintained by 200 pilots, technical crew, and engineers. And they are just one example of the state-of-the-art search and rescue technologies that will be available at Prestwick and across the UK. The UK government has put £2 billion into our search and rescue services and over £70 million of that has been spent here in Prestwick. It’s a great example of where the UK government is co-ordinating vital work across the whole country. So I know this facility will give you the very best chance of succeeding in your missions. And I wish you many, many successful missions in the years ahead. So thank you for the work you do. Thank you for serving our country. And thank you, ahead of time, for all the lives you will save from Prestwick and the 9 other bases across the UK."

/government/news/transport-secretary-sees-thriving-uk-marine-sector-at-london-boat-show,"Patrick McLoughlin meets next generation of boat designers keeping Britain ahead of the worldwide competition. Transport Secretary sees thriving UK marine sector at London Boat Show  Department for Transport Maritime and Coastguard Agency Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin today (13 January 2016) saw the cream of Britain’s world-class marine sector as he visited the London Boat Show at ExCeL. He met exhibitors showcasing the latest state-of-the-art, British-built boats and also heard first-hand about skilled job opportunities from university design students currently taking part in a Superyacht UK design competition. The UK’s maritime industry, including commercial shipping and sea ports, currently contributes at least £11 billion to the economy each year, and supports around 113,000 jobs and 6,600 businesses. It encompasses the marine sector, which focuses primarily on the engineering and innovative technology behind the vessels. Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said: “The UK’s maritime industry is a major success story and the London Boat Show displays the impressive skills and world-class products provided by the sector. “Britain’s highly advanced, leading maritime industries are creating jobs and keeping the UK ahead of the worldwide competition. We are determined to play our part by supporting the UK’s continued growth as a leading international maritime nation, from leisure boats to the biggest container ships afloat today.” Among the exhibitors Patrick McLoughlin met were Princess Yachts International, who employ over 2,300 people at a former naval yard in Plymouth that was redeveloped following support from the government’s Regional Growth Fund . Also, Williams Jet Tenders who started in 1995 creating handcrafted wooden power boats from a garden shed and have since developed into a worldwide brand. Howard Pridding, Chief Executive of British Marine, said: “We were delighted to host the Secretary of State at the London Boat Show. The UK’s marine industry is a vibrant sector, growing again for the fourth consecutive year. We welcome the government’s renewed focus on marine and maritime and we are working with departments across government to meet the ambitions set out in the Maritime Growth Study. As always, there is more that can be done from all of us and we look forward to working with Secretary of State to further the success of the sector.” Maritime Minister Robert Goodwill also attended the London Boat Show to give a speech to the Royal Yachting Association detailing the work undertaken by the Department for Transport to support the industry following the Maritime Growth Study . Last month the government responded to the study with pledges to work with industry to boost training in the sector, identify skills gaps, support maritime education and promote the wide range of careers in the sector. The government also took forward one of the study’s key recommendations by establishing a ministerial working group to tackle key issues in the sector and identify opportunities for future growth. The group met for the first time in November 2015. [Contact:1017]"

/government/news/foreign-flagged-ships-under-detention-in-the-uk-during-december-2015,"The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) announced today that four foreign flagged ships were under detention in UK ports during December 2015 after failing Port State Control (PSC) inspection. FOREIGN FLAGGED SHIPS UNDER DETENTION IN THE UK DURING DECEMBER 2015  Maritime and Coastguard Agency During December, there was one new detention of a foreign flagged vessel in a UK port. Three vessels remained under detention from previous months. A total of four vessels remain under detention at the end of December. In response to one of the recommendations of Lord Donaldson’s Inquiry into the prevention of pollution from merchant shipping and in compliance with the EU Directive on Port State Control (2009/16/EC as amended), the Maritime and Coastguard agency (MCA) publishes details of the foreign flagged vessels detained in UK ports each month. The UK is part of a regional agreement on port state control known as the Paris Memorandum of Understanding on Port State Control (Paris MOU) and information on all ships that are inspected is held centrally in an electronic database known as Thetis. This allows the ships of flags with poor detention records to be targeted for future inspection. Inspections of foreign flagged ships in UK ports are undertaken by surveyors from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. When a ship is found to be not in compliance with applicable Convention requirements, a deficiency may be raised. If the deficiency is so serious that it has to be rectified before departure, then the ship may be detained. All deficiencies should be rectified before departure if at all possible. When applicable, the list includes those passenger craft prevented from operating under the provisions of the EU Directive on Mandatory Surveys for the safe operation of regular Ro-Ro ferry and high speed passenger craft services (1999/35/EU).

/government/news/foreign-flagged-ships-under-detention-in-the-uk-during-february-2016,"The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) announced today that eight foreign flagged ships were under detention in UK ports during February 2016 after failing Port State Control (PSC) inspection. Foreign flagged ships under detention in the UK during February 2016  Maritime and Coastguard Agency At the beginning of February there were four vessels under detention. During February there were four new detentions, and one vessel was released after making satisfactory improvements. At the end of February a total of seven vessels remain under detention. In response to one of the recommendations of Lord Donaldson’s inquiry into the prevention of pollution from merchant shipping, and in compliance with the EU Directive on Port State Control (2009/16/EC as amended), the Maritime and Coastguard agency (MCA) publishes details of the foreign flagged vessels detained in UK ports each month. The UK is part of a regional agreement on port state control known as the Paris Memorandum of Understanding on Port State Control (Paris MOU) and information on all ships that are inspected is held centrally in an electronic database known as THETIS. This allows the ships with a high risk rating and poor detention records to be targeted for future inspection. Inspections of foreign flagged ships in UK ports are undertaken by surveyors from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. When a ship is found to be not in compliance with applicable convention requirements, a deficiency may be raised. If any of their deficiencies are so serious they have to be rectified before departure, then the ship will be detained. All deficiencies should be rectified before departure if at all possible. When applicable, the list includes those passenger craft prevented from operating under the provisions of the EU Directive on Mandatory Surveys for the safe operation of regular Ro-Ro ferry and high speed passenger craft services (1999/35/EU).

/government/news/foreign-flagged-ships-under-detention-in-the-uk-during-april-2016,"The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) announced today that five foreign flagged ships were under detention in UK ports during April 2016 after failing Port State Control (PSC) inspection. FOREIGN FLAGGED SHIPS UNDER DETENTION IN THE UK DURING APRIL 2016  Maritime and Coastguard Agency During April, there were three new detentions of foreign flagged vessels in a UK port. Two vessels remained under detention from previous months. A total of five vessels remain under detention at the end of April. In response to one of the recommendations of Lord Donaldson’s inquiry into the prevention of pollution from merchant shipping, and in compliance with the EU Directive on Port State Control (2009/16/EC as amended), the Maritime and Coastguard agency (MCA) publishes details of the foreign flagged vessels detained in UK ports each month. The UK is part of a regional agreement on port state control known as the Paris Memorandum of Understanding on Port State Control (Paris MOU) and information on all ships that are inspected is held centrally in an electronic database known as THETIS. This allows the ships with a high risk rating and poor detention records to be targeted for future inspection. Inspections of foreign flagged ships in UK ports are undertaken by surveyors from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. When a ship is found to be not in compliance with applicable convention requirements, a deficiency may be raised. If any of their deficiencies are so serious they have to be rectified before departure, then the ship will be detained. All deficiencies should be rectified before departure if at all possible. When applicable, the list includes those passenger craft prevented from operating under the provisions of the EU Directive on Mandatory Surveys for the safe operation of regular Ro-Ro ferry and high speed passenger craft services (1999/35/EU). Notes on the list of detentions Full details of the ship.

/government/news/foreign-flagged-ships-under-detention-in-the-uk-during-june-2016,"The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) announced today that seven foreign flagged ships were under detention in UK ports during June 2016 after failing Port State Control (PSC) inspection. FOREIGN FLAGGED SHIPS UNDER DETENTION IN THE UK DURING JUNE 2016  Maritime and Coastguard Agency During June, there were three new detentions of foreign flagged vessels in a UK port. Four vessels remained under detention from previous months. A total of four vessels remain under detention at the end of June. In response to one of the recommendations of Lord Donaldson’s inquiry into the prevention of pollution from merchant shipping, and in compliance with the EU Directive on Port State Control (2009/16/EC as amended), the Maritime and Coastguard agency (MCA) publishes details of the foreign flagged vessels detained in UK ports each month. The UK is part of a regional agreement on port state control known as the Paris Memorandum of Understanding on Port State Control (Paris MOU) and information on all ships that are inspected is held centrally in an electronic database known as THETIS. This allows the ships with a high risk rating and poor detention records to be targeted for future inspection. Inspections of foreign flagged ships in UK ports are undertaken by surveyors from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. When a ship is found to be not in compliance with applicable convention requirements, a deficiency may be raised. If any of their deficiencies are so serious they have to be rectified before departure, then the ship will be detained. All deficiencies should be rectified before departure if at all possible. When applicable, the list includes those passenger craft prevented from operating under the provisions of the EU Directive on Mandatory Surveys for the safe operation of regular Ro-Ro ferry and high speed passenger craft services (1999/35/EU).

ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 are standards that relate to maximising quality (ISO 9001) and minimising environmental impact (ISO 14001) through the implementation of documented management systems. Both ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 focus on how an organisation manages its processes. Both these management standards state the requirements that the management system must have in order that the company’s processes focus on how they manage quality and environmental impact. Benefits of implementing the ISO 9001 standard. ISO 9001 provides customers with a benchmark standard against which your customers can measure your performance and be assured that your product and / or service are carefully monitored for quality. This leads to: Improved customer satisfaction Reduced costs by reducing losses Increased effectiveness in use of resources Motivated & committed employees Experience & Knowledge Benefits of implementing the ISO 14001 standard Cutting costs, e.g. energy, waste, raw materials Ensuring compliance with regulatory and legal requirements Building public image towards clients, regulatory bodies and other stakeholders Motivating your employees Benefits of Certification Reduced costs – increased profits Good customer relations Improved image/market share Help define best practices Competitive edge Why Choose MCA QA? MCA QA is a branch of MCA that offers a harmonised audit programme that covers the ISM Code, ISO 9001, ISO 14001, MLC 2006 and the ISPS Code.

/guidance/offshore-renewable-energy-installations-impact-on-shipping,"How wind farms and wave and tidal energy devices can endanger navigation, emergency response operations, marine radar and GPS communications. Offshore Renewable Energy Installations: impact on shipping Maritime safety Maritime and Coastguard Agency Introduction In the UK, there is an increasing number of Offshore Renewable Energy Installations ( OREIs ) including wind farms, and wave and tidal energy devices. This forms part of the government’s commitment to reducing its carbon footprint and tackling climate change. The location, size and irregular shape of OREIs present new challenges to the safe navigation and communication of shipping and emergency rescue. These difficulties could contribute to a marine casualty leading to injury, death or loss of property, either at sea or among the population ashore. This guide provides details on the impact of OREIs on navigational safety and emergency response. The information is particularly useful for OREI developers. It also provides information on navigation and voyage planning to help you assess all risks and plan safe passage. Finally, this guide includes research on the impact of OREIs on marine radar, communications and positioning systems and search and rescue helicopter operations. Offshore Renewable Energy Installation impact on navigational safety and emergency response Existing or proposed OREIs in UK internal waters, territorial sea or in the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) beyond the territorial sea have the potential to affect marine navigation and safety. The impact must be assessed and mitigation measures put in place to ensure the safety of life at sea.  Assessments need to be made of the consequences of ships deviating from normal routes and recreational or fishing vessels entering shipping routes in order to avoid proposed sites.  As an OREI developer, you will need to ensure that you minimise the impact of your developments. OREIs can include: offshore wind farms marine current turbines wave generators any other installation Recommendations for OREI If you are an OREI developer seeking formal consent for marine works, you will need to consider recommendations from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency ( MCA ). If you fail to consider these recommendations, there may be objections to your proposal on the grounds of navigational safety or emergency response preparedness. Download Marine Guidance Note ( MGN ) 543 (M+F) Navigational, safety and emergency response guidance for OREIs . You can find information on development consents and licensing for OREIs over 100 megawatts in England and Wales on the Infrastructure Planning Commission website and for OREIs in Scotland on the Marine Scotland website . You can also find information on development consents and licensing for OREIs between 1 and 100 megawatts on the Marine Management Organisation website and Natural . The recommendations also include information to address the navigational impact and emergency response of proposed OREI sites. The development of an OREI requires a clear consent process to deal with potential detrimental effects and should take account of local factors, national standards and international aspects which could influence the establishment of an OREI . The Energy Act 2004 also established a regulatory regime for OREIs beyond territorial waters, in the UK’s EEZ. This supplements the regime which already applies in UK internal and territorial waters and Section 99 deals specifically with navigation. Read the Energy Act 2004 on the Legislation.gov website . How and when the OREI recommendations should be used If you are an OREI developer, you and your contracted environmental and risk assessors should take the recommendations into account for all sites within the jurisdiction of port limits or in open sea areas for the preparation of: Scoping Reports Environmental Impact Assessments ( EIA ) Environmental Statements ( ES ) You may also be required to comply with specific criteria from port authorities. Also, where proposals within port limits could affect navigation or emergency planning or response, the port authorities will be under an obligation to review its safety management system, in accordance with the Port Marine Safety Code. You should undertake such reviews in parallel with your EIA , with the outcome addressed in the resulting ES . You should comply with the recommendations during all phases of: planning construction operation decommissioning During these phases, you should immediately send information concerning the navigational impact to all relevant mariners, organisations and authorities. You should plan and practice contingency arrangements to deal with marine casualties in or adjacent to sites, including responses to environmental pollution, to test their efficiency. These recommendations can be changed or modified by the MCA - on the basis of experience or in accordance with internationally recognised standards - in the interest of safety of life at sea and protection of the marine environment. Navigational considerations You should assess navigational and communication impacts or difficulties around the site area and surroundings to determine any potential obstruction of, or danger to, seafarers or emergency response services. This assessment will also help to establish the best options to be adopted, including those of operational site monitoring. You should consult with local and national search and rescue authorities, and consider the types of aircraft, vessels and equipment which might be used in emergencies. This should include the possible use of OREI structures as emergency refuges and any matters that might affect emergency response within or close to the OREI . You should also assess the consequences of ships deviating from normal routes and recreational or fishing vessels entering shipping routes in order to avoid proposed sites. It is important to consider any situation which could lead to safety of navigation being compromised, eg: an increase in end-on or crossing encounters reduction in sea-room or water depth for manoeuvring - leading to choke points When considering navigational priority, you should treat all seagoing water craft, operations and mariners as the same. Navigation and voyage planning around Offshore Renewable Energy Installations Around the UK, the number of Offshore Renewable Energy Installations ( OREIs ) is increasing and they may be close to shipping routes. You should be aware that there is no right of access to any type of OREI . They are private property and appropriate warning signs are displayed. Access to an OREI requires skill and is limited by the state of the sea, and should only be undertaken in controlled circumstances by trained personnel. The visibility of offshore wind, wave and tidal energy installations will depend on the device type as some installations are totally submerged while others may only protrude slightly above the sea surface. The marking of offshore wave and tidal energy installations will be based on recommendations of the International Association of Marine Aids to Navigation and Lighthouse Authorities ( IALA ). Download offshore structures marking guidance from the IALA website Wind farms When planning a voyage, mariners should assess all hazards and associated risks, including the proximity of wind farms and turbines, for example: spacing - wind farm turbines are usually spaced 500 metres or more apart depending on the size of the turbine depth of water - most wind turbines operate in relatively shallow water though new generations of wind farm will be constructed in deeper water, possibly restricting navigable channels seabed changes - wind farm structures could, over time, affect the depth of water in their vicinity through scouring of the seabed making depth information unreliable tidal streams - wind farm structures may obstruct tidal streams locally, creating eddies nearby small craft - vessels involved in turbine maintenance and safety duties may be encountered or obscured within or around a wind farm - fishing vessels may also operate and be obscured in the area shore marks - in coastal areas shore marks may also be obscured by wind farm structures electrical transformer stations - can be found in or adjacent to larger wind farms rotor effects - can change the flow of the wind and impact on a vessel [Download MGN 372 (M+F) guidance for mariners on operating in the vicinity of OREIs in the UK (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mgn-372-guidance-to-mariners-operating-in-vicinity-of-uk-oreis). Offshore wave and tidal energy installations Unlike wind farms, you may have difficulty seeing systems using wave or tidal energy as they are likely to be located at or near the surface, for example: attenuators point absorbers oscillating wave surge converters oscillating water columns overtopping devices submerged pressure differentials There are also many other devices that may have unique and very different designs to the more well-established types of technology, for example: tidal energy convertors ( TECs ) horizontal axis turbines horizontal axis turbines (enclosed blade tips) vertical axis turbines oscillating hydrofoils The visibility of offshore wave and tidal energy installations will depend on the device type as some installations are totally submerged while others may only protrude slightly above the sea surface. The marking of offshore wave and tidal energy installations will be based on recommendations of the IALA . Download offshore structures marking guidance from the IALA website Methods for fixing wave energy convertors ( WECs ) and TECs to the seabed You will need to know the various methods by which WECs and TECs can be fixed to the seabed, as it will affect their visibility above the surface, for example: seabed mounted/gravity base devices - physically sit on the seabed by virtue of the weight of the combined device/foundation - some may also have additional fixing to the seabed pile mounted - attached to a pile penetrating the ocean floor floating flexible mooring - tethered via a cable/chain to the seabed, allowing considerable freedom of movement floating rigid mooring - secured into position using a fixed mooring system, allowing minimal movement hydrofoil inducing down force - uses a number of hydrofoils mounted on a frame to induce a positioning down force from the tidal current flow transformer station or hub - a special structure containing power conversion equipment either within or outside the wave/tidal energy group to which individual generators are connected via a power cable - a submarine cable transfers the power ashore from the hub, which may be a separate fixed or floating platform Safety zones There are a few safety zones in place around some UK offshore wind farms currently under construction, with more likely to be introduced in the near future, all of which will be monitored and policed. A temporary safety zone may be established during the construction, major maintenance and decommissioning of OREIs and therefore should be avoided. Notices to mariners and radio navigation warning broadcasts may be used to inform people of such a zone, and chart and hydrographic publications will be used. These zones will be monitored by support craft which may include fishing vessels employed by developers as guard vessels. Permanent safety zones are not expected to be established around entire wind farm groups, though single installations may be considered. The effect on navigation and communication systems of OREIs OREIs can be large and there could be several of them within a particular area. As a result, OREIs that cover large areas of open water can present potential hazards to navigation. This is particularly dangerous if there are a number of OREIs close to or encroaching into waters where there is a high density of shipping movements, fishing vessels and recreational craft usage. Because of their nature, OREI positions are exposed to weather conditions and are often in shallow water, which could affect the navigation of vessels, particularly small craft and inshore shipping, gaining access to ports or to waters that provide a more sheltered passage required in bad weather and sea conditions. Also, tidal streams of varying sets and rates pass through all wind farm sites and some sites are within port limits or lie within Vessel Traffic Services ( VTS ) operational limits. Maritime communication Mariners and organisations require consistent and effective radio communications systems. If you are within close range of an OREI , you should be able to rely on marine navigation systems as much as if you were in open sea. However, those requiring line of sight promulgation may be affected by wind turbines. You will also need to be able to detect other craft in the area and to take appropriate avoiding action. Port authorities and VTS operators require effective detection, identification and tracking of vessels navigating in their areas to: organise traffic provide traffic information provide navigational assistance services to vessels operating within port approaches prescribe routing schemes to meet their statutory responsibilities in respect of the safety of navigation Emergency services such as Royal National Lifeboat Institution vessels and HM Coastguard require the ability to rapidly detect and react to maritime casualties. If there is a failure of any radar, navigation or communication system it could: reduce safety levels lead to marine casualties reduce the effectiveness of emergency service operations If an incident involves a passenger vessel, or a vessel carrying dangerous and polluting cargo, it could have serious consequences for the public and the environment, both at sea and ashore. Theoretical studies into the impact of OREIs on radio systems Experiments were carried out to test the theoretical results from an earlier study that predicted the impact on marine radio systems by the North Hoyle wind farm, off the North Wales coast. In the theoretical study, results showed that wind turbines have very large radar cross-sections, which scatter a large proportion of any incident electromagnetic energy. The turbines also cast shadows behind themselves, looking from the direction of the transmitter. The study suggested that small vessels within the North Hoyle wind farm would be detectable with marine radar - both 3 gigahertz and 9 gigahertz - if they were not in the shadow of a turbine. However, detection of the vessel could be compromised if it was very close and directly behind a turbine. The effect of the shadow at 3 gigahertz was found to be much less severe than at 9 gigahertz. The impact on Global Positioning Systems ( GPS ) was found to be minimal, with any interference very rarely causing any corruption to the GPS data. Unless a GPS receiver was within 70 metres (based on a signal-to-noise ratio of 15 decibels) of a wind turbine then any interference would be insignificant. The study looked at very high frequency ( VHF ) communications and concluded that due to the wavelength of the VHF systems, any interference caused by wind turbines would be negligible. Scientific and practical research The North Hoyle wind farm research tried to obtain scientific and practical operational data on the performance of various navigation and communications systems within and in the vicinity of offshore wind farms. The research focused on how the performance of systems would be adversely affected, with cost effective solutions recommended. Four different trials were designed to test the validity of the results from the theoretical study and indicated that there is minimal impact on: VHF radio GPS receivers cellular telephones automated identification system Ultra high frequency and other microwave systems suffered from the normal masking effect when turbines were in the line of the transmissions. The turbines produced strong radar echoes giving early warning of their presence. At close range, turbines may produce multiple reflected and side lobe echoes that can mask real targets. These develop at about 1.5 nautical miles, with radar displays becoming worse as the range closes. Where a shipping lane passes within this range, considerable interference may be expected along a line of turbines. The target size of the turbine echo increases close to the turbine, with target definition and bearing discrimination becoming worse on both 3 and 10 centimetre radars. Following on from these trials, a critical assessment of search and rescue ( SAR ) activities within and close to offshore wind farms was carried out. This outcome may be used to inform the consents process of offshore wind farm applications.

/government/news/foreign-flagged-ships-under-detention-in-the-uk-during-august-2016,"The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) announced today that seven foreign flagged ships were under detention in UK ports during August 2016 after failing Port State Control (PSC) inspection FOREIGN FLAGGED SHIPS UNDER DETENTION IN THE UK DURING August 2016  Maritime and Coastguard Agency During August, there was one new detention of foreign flagged vessels in a UK port. Six vessels remained under detention from previous months. A total of four vessels remain under detention at the end of August. In response to one of the recommendations of Lord Donaldson’s inquiry into the prevention of pollution from merchant shipping, and in compliance with the EU Directive on Port State Control (2009/16/EC as amended), the Maritime and Coastguard agency (MCA) publishes details of the foreign flagged vessels detained in UK ports each month. The UK is part of a regional agreement on port state control known as the Paris Memorandum of Understanding on Port State Control (Paris MOU) and information on all ships that are inspected is held centrally in an electronic database known as THETIS. This allows the ships with a high risk rating and poor detention records to be targeted for future inspection. Inspections of foreign flagged ships in UK ports are undertaken by surveyors from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. When a ship is found to be not in compliance with applicable convention requirements, a deficiency may be raised. If any of their deficiencies are so serious they have to be rectified before departure, then the ship will be detained. All deficiencies should be rectified before departure if at all possible. When applicable, the list includes those passenger craft prevented from operating under the provisions of the EU Directive on Mandatory Surveys for the safe operation of regular Ro-Ro ferry and high speed passenger craft services (1999/35/EU).

/government/speeches/a-new-generation-of-shipbuilders,"Shipping Minister John Hayes delivers a speech to the Worshipful Company of Shipwrights. A new generation of shipbuilders  Department for Transport Maritime and Coastguard Agency Thank you for inviting me to speak today (19 October 2016). And thank you to the Worshipful Company of Shipwrights for organising what’s set to be yet another successful series of lectures and presentations. Livery companies like this one were a fundamental part of the evolution of trades; embodying, codifying, and verifying the skills without which the highest standards could not be achieved The role that they undertake has changed through the years, since the Shipwrights was founded over 700 years ago. But they still play a vital role in providing shape and character to trades and skills. As a former minister for Further Education, Skills and Lifelong learning, I have a deep appreciation for apprenticeships and the value of practical learning. I am personally proud of the role I played in helping businesses create more apprenticeships than modern Britain has ever seen. It was a mission shaped in opposition as shadow minister and delivered in government when I stepped from the shadows to the light. It was, in no small part, inspired by what apprenticeships symbolise: the passing-on of skill from one generation to the next, proof that learning by doing is just as demanding and praiseworthy as learning from a book. Everyone gathered together in this room today has a great and historic responsibility. On your shoulders rests Britain’s future as the world’s leading maritime nation. If, 100 years from now, we are still to be famous as the country that builds, repairs and maintains the finest vessels that sail the seas; if we are still to be renowned as the home of shipbuilding genius and skill; and if we are still to be celebrated as the nation that leads the world’s maritime affairs, it will be because those in this room today seized the opportunity to learn, to train, and to excel at everything you do. No one should overlook the importance of your task – of carrying on our country’s tradition of maritime achievement, innovation and leadership. So I am honoured to speak with you today. This is the second time I have been appointed Minister for Shipping. Once by David Cameron, and once by Theresa May. And both times it has been thrilling to meet and work with the people whose roles are the foundation of our economy and even our way of life. Yet there’s something about the way people talk and think about maritime sector in this country that I’d like to see change. And that’s the perception among the general public that this sector’s greatest achievements are in its past. I understand the pull of our maritime past. I grew up in the shadow of Woolwich dockyards, which were for hundreds of years the shipping workshop of the world. Yet for all the glories of the past, if we allow them to obscure the triumphs of the present and the future, we’re letting the industry down. It simply isn’t true that the sector’s greatest achievements are behind us. Just as the film at the beginning demonstrated. The UK is a major global shipbuilder, producing life-saving rescue boats, science-shaping polar research ships, world-beating naval vessels including aircraft, autonomous surface and underwater vehicles, and our cutting-edge superyachts – some of which I had the pleasure of admiring during my visit to the Southampton Boat Show a few weeks ago. All of these drive innovation every bit as advanced as the work that goes into driverless car technology, drones and spacecraft. And so often, it’s the maritime sector leading the march of new technology. Of course, we also export these cutting-edge craft around the globe, generating £2.5 billion a year for our economy. And it’s for these reasons that we want to see more people joining you. We want to see more people starting careers in the marine and maritime industry and being trained to the highest standards. I would like to recognise and applaud the marine industry’s creation of apprenticeships in advanced systems engineering, boatbuilding and for mechanical and electrical fitters. Apprenticeship standards like these set the bar for what employers need from their apprenticeship programmes, making sure they are high quality, relevant and responsive to the needs of the industry, which all in turn supports you in embarking on highly successful careers in the marine industry. And when that training is completed, there are great opportunities. Yet we want to see more of the economic growth that generates those opportunities. So one of my roles is to serve as the Chairman of the Ministerial Working Group for Maritime Growth. This team of ministers has been established to maintain and enhance the UK’s position as a leading maritime centre. We’re currently focusing on increasing exports to China, Korea and Brazil, securing inward investment, reforming the UK Shipping Register and developing a maritime skills strategy. And, tomorrow, I am travelling to Birkenhead and Liverpool, with its justly earned reputation as a maritime cluster of global significance. There I will open a new Simulation Suite, the most advanced bridge simulator in Europe. And, of course, the £200 million polar research ship RSS Sir David Attenborough is currently being built in Birkenhead . The boat is perhaps better known as the vessel the online voting public wanted named Boaty McBoatface. There’s a lesson in that tale for all politicians: don’t ask the public a question to which you might not like the answer. When the RSS Sir David Attenborough sets sail in 2019, it will provide the UK with the most advanced floating research fleet in the world, and its construction in Merseyside is supporting 400 jobs and 60 apprenticeships. And, I am quietly pleased to say, the name Boaty McBoatface will live on as the title of one of RSS Sir David Attenborough’s high-tech, remotely operated on-board submarines. These developments, and others, reflect the UK’s strengths and our ability to compete with the world. Yet as I said at the beginning, all of these plans come to nothing without talented people able to make good on the government’s ambitions. And that means we need you, gathered here today. So thank you for everything you do in your working lives as you lead a new generation of British shipbuilding excellence. Before I relinquish the stage, I am delighted to hand over to Molly Ransom and Adam Hall, both recently graduated as Pendennis Shipyard apprentices, for a presentation which will illustrate a little of just how they are going about shaping the exciting future of this industry. Molly Ransom has recently graduated from an engineering apprenticeship at Pendennis Shipyard in Falmouth, Cornwall. During her 4 year course, Molly was awarded Apprentice of the Year in her second year, and has now progressed to a full-time role in the technically challenging environment of superyacht engineering. Her colleague, Adam Hall, also graduated this year, becoming a member of the Joinery team. During his training Adam was also awarded Apprentice of the Year by Pendennis, and his high level of competence was recognised at the annual UK Skills Awards 2015, where he was presented with a gold medal in cabinet making."
/government/news/mca-non-executive-chair-appointed-for-first-time,"Transport Secretary appoints non-executive chair to the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. MCA non-executive chair appointed for first time  Department for Transport Maritime and Coastguard Agency A non-executive chair, with over 40 years of commercial experience, has been appointed to the Maritime and Coastguard Agency ( MCA ) for the first time, in a move that will help keep the UK at the forefront of global shipping. Michael Parker will provide the MCA with vast experience, additional leadership and guidance as they continue to transform the agency. The Secretary of State for Transport made the appointment, fulfilling one of the key recommendations of the Maritime growth study 2015 . Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said: “I am delighted that Michael Parker has agreed to bring his wealth of experience to the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. International trade is vital to the UK ’s economic growth and bringing commercial expertise to the MCA will keep us at the very centre of global shipping, a position of added importance as we look to forge our future outside the EU .” This announcement coincides with the start of the countdown to London International Shipping Week ( LISW ) 2017 which will bring together global leaders from the maritime industry and showcase the best of the sector in the UK . Lord Mountevans’ ‘Maritime growth study’ was published during LISW 2015 and this appointment implements one of the key recommendations from the study. Michael Parker said: “I am very pleased to be taking up the role and look forward to the challenge of ensuring that the MCA continues to provide a high quality service while adapting to the changing needs and commercial requirements of international shipping. The UK is a world leading maritime nation and ensuring that the MCA provides both an effective and responsive service is central to retaining this position.” This appointment is part of a wider commitment to generate growth in the maritime sector, encourage greater investment in the UK and promote the UK flag as a world-class register that attracts quality ship owners. The maritime sector contributed at least £13.4 billion to the UK economy in 2014 and supports at least 111,000 jobs across the country. Michael will formally take up the role in January 2017. He brings over 40 years of experience in the shipping industry to the role, most recently as the chairman of CMA CGM Holdings ( UK ) Ltd , part of the third largest container operator in the world. Michael is a past President of the UK Chamber of Shipping and past board member of the International Chamber of Shipping. He is a Shipwright and Freeman of the City of London, Chairman of the Ellerman Benevolent Fund and trustee of the Institute of Marine Engineers. [Contact:1015]"

/government/news/foreign-flagged-ships-under-detention-in-the-uk-during-october-2016,"The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) announced today that nine foreign flagged ships were under detention in UK ports during October 2016 after failing Port State Control (PSC) inspection. FOREIGN FLAGGED SHIPS UNDER DETENTION IN THE UK DURING October 2016  Maritime and Coastguard Agency During October, there were five new detention of foreign flagged vessels in a UK port. Four vessels remained under detention from previous months. A total of four vessels remain under detention at the end of October. In response to one of the recommendations of Lord Donaldson’s inquiry into the prevention of pollution from merchant shipping, and in compliance with the EU Directive on Port State Control (2009/16/EC as amended), the Maritime and Coastguard agency (MCA) publishes details of the foreign flagged vessels detained in UK ports each month. The UK is part of a regional agreement on port state control known as the Paris Memorandum of Understanding on Port State Control (Paris MOU) and information on all ships that are inspected is held centrally in an electronic database known as THETIS. This allows the ships with a high risk rating and poor detention records to be targeted for future inspection. Inspections of foreign flagged ships in UK ports are undertaken by surveyors from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. When a ship is found to be not in compliance with applicable convention requirements, a deficiency may be raised. If any of their deficiencies are so serious they have to be rectified before departure, then the ship will be detained. All deficiencies should be rectified before departure if at all possible. When applicable, the list includes those passenger craft prevented from operating under the provisions of the EU Directive on Mandatory Surveys for the safe operation of regular Ro-Ro ferry and high speed passenger craft services (1999/35/EU). Notes on the list of detentions Full details of the ship.

/government/consultations/coastal-access-in-norfolk-sea-palling-to-weybourne,"Proposals for improved access to the Norfolk coast between Sea Palling and Weybourne. Coastal Access in Norfolk: Sea Palling to Weybourne  Natural England On 22 July 2013 Natural England submitted a report to the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs setting out our proposals for improved access to the Norfolk coast between Sea Palling and Weybourne. This follows on from a three-month public consultation asking for people’s views on the draft proposals for this stretch of coast. Under the Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009, Natural England has a statutory duty to improve access to the English coast. As well as securing a long-distance route around the whole of the coast, its role is to provide improved levels of access for local residents and visitors where they can walk, rest and admire the view. The report outlines key improvements to existing access along the coast in Norfolk between Sea Palling and Weybourne, with proposals: to identify a clear and continuous walking route along this part of the coast, bringing sections of existing coastal footpath closer to the sea; to allow the route to ‘roll back’ if the coastline erodes or slips, solving the long-standing difficulties of maintaining a continuous route along the coast; and to secure statutory rights of public access to areas of beach, cliff and coastal land for the first time in places where people currently enjoy access by long tradition or with the landowners’ permission."

/government/news/natural-england-welcomes-conviction-for-illegal-poisoning-of-birds-of-prey,"Natural England welcomes the conviction of a Norfolk gamekeeper for illegally poisoning 11 birds of prey on an estate in 2013. Natural England welcomes conviction for illegal poisoning of birds of prey  Natural England Allen Lambert, 65, who worked on the Stody Estate near Holt, was found guilty at Norwich Magistrates’ Court yesterday of two charges relating to killing 10 buzzards and a sparrowhawk and possession of associated pesticides and equipment. The remains of a further five buzzards were found on the estate but these birds were too decomposed for pesticide analysis. Lambert had earlier pleaded guilty to five other charges including unlawfully possessing nine dead buzzards – a protected species. Sentencing will take place on 6 November. The offences were discovered in April 2013 by a member of the public, who alerted the RSPB, and by a subsequent inspection of Lambert’s sheds and vehicle by a Natural England official, operating under a warrant from the Health and Safety Executive, accompanied by Norfolk Constabulary and the RSPB. Rob Cooke, Natural England’s Director of Sustainable Development, said: “The sheer scale of the offences in this case is shocking and I am dismayed that incidents like this are still occurring. We welcome the conviction and hope it will act as a significant deterrent to others. “I am pleased that Natural England were able to take part in this successful investigation with Norfolk Constabulary and other agencies, working under the Wildlife Incident Investigation Scheme ( WIIS ). It demonstrates that together we will not rest until those behind such crimes are brought to justice.”"

/government/news/england-coast-path-a-step-closer-in-cumbria,"Natural England has published its formal proposals to improve public access along a 55 km stretch of coast in Cumbria, between Whitehaven and Silecroft.  England Coast Path: a step closer in Cumbria  Natural England From 15 October 2014, there is a period of 8 weeks for legal interests and members of the public to make objections or representations. The Secretary of State must take these into account when considering whether to approve the proposals. If approved, this route will become part of the England Coast Path – the long distance walking route and National Trail - that is being developed around the entire English coast. Once completed, the path will be one of the longest coastal routes in the world. Natural England has been working on the Cumbria section of the England Coast Path since 2011. The first new access rights were opened between Allonby and Whitehaven earlier this year. This 55 km stretch extends south from Whitehaven and the proposed walking route will link together settlements such as St Bees, Seascale, Ravenglass and Silecroft. The route takes in mainly low-lying agricultural land and is in contrast to the dominating cliffs at St Bees Head. The proposals at St Bees will also help to provide an improved and secure first stage of the classic Wainwright Coast to Coast route. Here, the cliffs rise high above sea level, to provide spectacular views of the Cumbrian mountains and coast. Since 2012, Natural England and Cumbria County Council have met landowners and interested parties to ‘walk the course’, consider local issues and discuss the new route. The report outlines improvements to some of the existing access, as well as recommending many new sections between Whitehaven and Silecroft, with proposals to: identify a clear and continuous way-marked walking route along this part of the coast, bringing some sections of the existing coastal footpath closer to the sea and linking some places together for the first time allow the route to ‘roll back’ if the coastline erodes or slips, solving the long-standing difficulties of maintaining a continuous route along the coast secure legal rights of public access for the first time to the area’s beaches Anyone can make representations to Natural England about the report during the 8 week consultation period. Owners and occupiers of affected land can make objections about the report on specified grounds, which will be considered by a Planning Inspector before the Secretary of State makes a final decision. All representations and objections must be received by Natural England no later than 5pm on Wednesday 10 December 2014. Copies of the report can be viewed in several locations along the coast between Whitehaven and Silecroft: the Copeland Centre, Whitehaven; Seacote Hotel, St Bees; Tarnside Caravan park, Braystones; Seascale Library; and The Pennington Hotel, Ravenglass . The full report and all the forms and guidance on how to make a representation or objection within the next 8 weeks are also available on GOV.UK. Natural England’s area manager Simon Humphries said; “This is the next step to establish the England Coast Path route along the Cumbria coastline, which will take in some fine views and many areas of coastline that have not previously had access. “We’ve worked closely with Cumbria County Council, landowners and interested groups to identify a route and thank everyone for their time so far. We encourage anyone with a view on coastal access to take a look at the plans, which are now available for comment for the next eight weeks. Owners of land affected by the proposals may also submit a formal objection should they wish ”. Councillor Keith Little, Cumbria County Council’s cabinet member for highways, said: “We are pleased to see the progress being made in developing this route further down the coast, following the successful completion of the section between Allonby and Whitehaven earlier this year. When linked together, these two stretches will give a fantastic walking experience, provide a real boost to the local economy and take us a step closer to a new national trail along our outstanding coastline.” This report is issued under the revised coastal access scheme, which is the methodology for the whole project. This scheme was approved by the government in July 2013, and simplifies the process followed on each stretch of coast. Notes to editors Natural England press office contact: Emma Lusby, press officer / 0300 060 4231 / emma.lusby@naturalengland.org.uk The Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009 places a duty on the Secretary of State and Natural England to secure a long distance walking trail around the open coast of England, together with public access rights to a wider area of land along the way for people to enjoy. The England Coast Path will be a new long distance National Trail that will eventually allow people to walk 4,500km around the whole of the English Coast. In addition to Cumbria, Natural England is also currently working to deliver coastal access in several other locations around the country: south west: Somerset and Dorset south east: Kent east of England: Norfolk north east: Durham, Sunderland and Hartlepool, and North Yorkshire and East Riding of Yorkshire. The right of access has already been introduced on stretches of the coast near Weymouth, and on other parts of the coast in Cumbria and Durham/Hartlepool and Sunderland.

The closing date for representations or objections is 5pm, Wednesday 10 December 2014. About coastal access Work is underway to create a footpath around the entire coast of England. When completed, the England Coast Path will be 4,500km long and include new sections of coastline where people will be able to walk, rest and admire the view. It means that walkers will be able to arrive at our coast and turn left or right to enjoy a well-marked National Trail. It will be one of the longest coastal trails in the world. The route will join up existing coastal paths and for the first time, the route will be able to ‘roll back’ where it erodes. Teams are currently working in 6 areas around the country, on up to 3 stretches of route at a time. They follow a series of steps, to put the route in place. Stage 1: local authorities and other key interests are approached when the stretch project team is ready to start work in their area Stage 2: landowners are contacted and route proposals are discussed on the ground to identify the best line for the trail. Stage 3: proposals for the route are drawn up and presented to the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs for consideration. This also creates an 8 week window where objections or representations can be made on the plans. A public hearing may be held at the Planning Inspector’s request, if objections are upheld and unresolved. Stage 4: the route is approved by the Secretary of State. Work can then begin by the local authority to put the route markers, gates and other structures in place. Stage 5: the route is opened to the public This map shows where progress is being made on the route ."
/government/news/rare-plants-to-receive-intensive-care-on-devon-coast,"Conservation work to ensure the survival of 2 of Britain’s rarest plants to be carried out by Natural England and Torridge District Council. Rare plants to receive ‘intensive care’ on Devon coast  Natural England The sand dunes of Northam Burrows are home to the water germander – found in only 2 other locations in England – and the sea stock, which only grows in a handful of other places. The dunes are so important to these and a range of other plants that they are protected as a Site of Special Scientific Interest. However, the spread of thick vegetation in the area is threatening the survival of these rare plants. In order to help them thrive, Torridge District Council and Natural England – the government’s conservation adviser – are to begin essential conservation work later this autumn. Diggers will be used to carefully ‘scrape’ off a thin layer of vegetation, exposing bare sand across parts of the site in which sea stock and water germander can thrive. The growth of the more vigorous vegetation will then be held in check with the help of grazing by sheep and horses. The fen orchid has already become extinct from the Taw-Torridge dunes, but with the help of this “intensive care” plan it is hoped that the sea stock and water germander will avoid a similar fate. Water germander (Teucrium scordium), which looks a little like mint but smells of garlic, prefers damp open ground with no other vegetation, and will not grow under scrub. To reproduce it sends out creepers, but is fairly exacting in its requirements, and doesn’t like too many other plants nearby to compete with it. It favours the damp sand dune slacks at Northam Burrows but is being crowded out by grasses and other species. It’s only other strongholds in England are in nearby Braunton Burrows and Cambridgeshire. Sea stock (Matthiola sinuata), with its pale violet flowers and delightful perfume, has evolved to thrive in pure sand. It cannot tolerate dense vegetation, shade or high nutrient levels. Justin Gillett, Natural England’s conservation adviser, said: “Northam Burrows is a superb coastal site and home to some of the rarest plants in the country. But the vegetation on the dunes is causing serious problems for these plants. “Every single species plays an important role in the fabric of our natural environment and we can’t afford to see the water germander and the sea stock disappear from the area like the fen orchid. That’s why Natural England and Torridge District Council are keen to give them a helping hand. This work is seen as critical in reversing the decline in key species for which the site has become renowned.” Councillor Roger Johnson, deputy leader and lead member for Northam Burrows, said: “The Burrows really is a unique environment but unless we manage it carefully some of our rarest wildlife treasures could be lost forever. I am really excited that this project will both maintain and increase the area of grazing for domesticated stock, but also add diversity to the landscape of this important site for the benefit of the public. Perhaps most importantly though it will provide the intensive care now needed to safeguard all the rare species for which the site has been famed for over a hundred years. It is great to see so many organisations both national and local come together to deliver this welcome and carefully planned package of conservation measures.” Northam Burrows hosts no fewer than 46 nationally and locally rare, scarce and threatened plant species which give the site its distinctive characteristics. In fact, this particular combination of rarities is thought to be unique to this single site in Britain. The conservation work is expected to take up to 2 years to complete. As well as benefitting the protected plants it will appeal to visitors by creating different areas of interest across this larger site and enhancing access. It is being funded through Higher Level Stewardship, a government scheme that provides grants to land managers and farmers to help them manage important sites for nature conservation."

Wildlife licensing: changes to class licence WML-CL22 - non native bumblebee release in commercial glass houses and poly-tunnels  Natural England Due to both the accepted risks associated with non native bumblebees and the switch by many growers to use native (British) commercial bumblebees, Natural England is proposing to not re-issue a grower class licence which permits growers in England to release non native bumblebees. The current licence expires on 31 December 2014. This change will not affect or place any restrictions on the use of commercial native pollination bumblebees. We believe that as native bumblebees are commercially available as an alternative to non natives, it is now appropriate to consider proposals for release of non native bumblebees on a case-by-case basis, rather than permit releases through a class licence. If growers wish to continue to release non native bumblebees they will need to apply to Natural England for an individual licence for this activity."

England Coast Path in Kent: two steps forward  Natural England Folkestone to Ramsgate Approval for a new stretch of the England Coast Path has been given by the Secretary of State. Work can now begin to open up or improve 59 kms long stretch of access along the well-known coastline between Folkestone and Ramsgate This will be ready for walkers to enjoy when it is opened later in the year. Kent County Council will now lead the implementation work to prepare this new stretch of coast path for public use. Their first step is to contact owners and occupiers to finalise the design and location of any new infrastructure, such as signs and gates. The new walking rights will commence once the route has been established and any necessary works have been completed. When officially opened, this 59 km route will provide, for the first time, new rights of access to coastal land including foreshore, beaches, and cliffs; including areas where everyone can rest, relax and admire the view. Crucially, the path will be able to ‘roll back’ should the cliffs erode or slip – enabling a replacement route to be put in place quickly if necessary, helping to maintain a continuous route along the coast. Improved access will support local economies, by attracting visitors to explore this popular coastline, and boosting business for local shops, pubs and hotels. James Seymour, Natural England Manager for Sussex and Kent, said: “We are delighted this route, which takes in famous and historic landmarks has been given the green light. I’d like to say a huge thank you to everyone who has been involved in the preparations, as their significant knowledge and expertise has been invaluable in helping to shape the route. We have worked closely with a wide range of local interests in developing the proposals and we now look forward to working with Kent County Council to put the route in place for everyone to enjoy.” The England Coast Path is due to be completed by 2020 and will be a way-marked 4700km long National Trail , around the whole English coast. Work is already underway on more sections around England and proposals are being developed in close discussion with local authorities, landowners and businesses. This route includes the White Cliffs of Dover, one of our most familiar landmarks, along with Pegwell Bay National Nature Reserve where Harbour seals haul-out on the nearby mudflats. The trail will make extensive use of existing coastal paths such as the Saxon Shore Way, Stour Valley Walk, Thanet Coastal Path, and the North Downs Way National Trail – and will improve access around the Stour Estuary. It will include new access to the historic site of Richborough port, which played a significant role in campaigns during both world wars; and will go through Sandwich town. Natural England has recently published a map which shows where and when coastal access will be improved over the next five years. Ramsgate to Whitstable: proposals published In addition, Natural England has published proposals to improve public access along a 40 km stretch of coast between Ramsgate and Whitstable. If approved, this route will also become part of the England Coast Path. This route includes the famous resort towns of Ramsgate, Margate and Broadstairs along with iconic Reculver Castle. The route also ascends the cliff via The 39 Steps, made famous in John Buchan’s novel of the same name and ends in the picturesque town of Whitstable. The trail will make extensive use of existing coastal paths including the Viking Coast Trail, the Oyster Bay Trail and the Thanet Coastal Path. It has improved access in places such as Kingsgate where a new path will take walkers off the busy coast road. Anyone can make representations to Natural England about the report during the next eight weeks. Owners and occupiers of affected land can make objections about the report on specified grounds, which will be considered by a Planning Inspector before the Secretary of State makes a final decision.

Malcolm Hodgson, National Trails Officer for the Cleveland Way which runs along much of the proposed route, said: The England Coast Path will use part of the existing Cleveland Way National Trail and the proposals include taking the route through the urban areas of Whitby and Scarborough for the first time – a plus for businesses in those towns. It’s important though that everyone with a view on where the route should go has a chance to see the plans and submit a formal response if they wish. I’m looking forward to continuing to work with Natural England and the local authorities to help improve the route for walkers in our area. As well as recommending new sections to the route, the report outlines improvements to existing access to the coast between Filey Brigg and Newport Bridge with proposals to: identify a clear and continuous way-marked walking route along this part of the coast, bringing some sections of the existing coastal footpath closer to the sea and linking some places together for the first time allow the route to ‘roll back’ if the coastline erodes or slips, solving the long-standing difficulties of maintaining a continuous route along the coast to secure legal rights of public access for the first time to the area’s beaches The England Coast Path is the new long distance National Trail that will allow people to walk 4,500km around the whole of the English Coast. Natural England are working to complete the route in five years and have recently published a map which shows where and when coastal access will be improved."

/government/news/green-bridges-safer-travel-for-wildlife,"Natural England reports that bridges built across roads and railways to allow wildlife movement can stop species from becoming isolated and reduce the number of traffic accidents. Green bridges: safer travel for wildlife  Natural England The bridges are known as green bridges, landscape bridges or wildlife overpasses and are usually planted with a variety of local trees or shrubs and other vegetation. They allow birds, mammals and insects to keep moving despite a road or railway blocking their path. Green bridges are common in Europe and North America, but only a few have been built in Britain. The report: “Green Bridges – a literature review” was undertaken by Land Use Consultants on behalf of Natural England. It looks at scientific evidence from 56 examples across the world, ranging from the Mile End green bridge in east London to the Compton Road faunal overpass in Brisbane, Australia. It is the first worldwide study of green bridges and has found that they could become an important part of the sustainability of future transport projects by: creating a safe crossing point for wildlife movement joining up habitats and connecting colonies, as they are also used by wildlife as a home in their own right creating a crossing point for people and benefit pollinators integrating roads and railways into the surrounding landscape As the government’s conservation agency, Natural England’s role is to make sure that the natural environment is conserved, enhanced and managed for the benefit of present and future generations. It gives advice on environmental impacts to planning authorities and developers to promote sustainable development. The information contained in the review will help developers and planners involved in major infrastructure projects to factor new green bridges into their construction plans or consider converting existing bridges to green bridges. Clare Warburton, Natural England’s Senior Transport Specialist, said: “People often think of roads and railways as cutting a swathe through important wildlife habitat but this study shows that green bridges can significantly reduce their environmental impact. Not only can green bridges provide an important connection between wildlife colonies, they can also provide a home for wildlife in their own right.” “By giving wildlife a clear route across major roads, green bridges also increase safety for roads users and animals alike. If sensitively designed to accommodate wildlife and people, they can also provide attractive routes that help local communities access the wider countryside. I hope the evidence in this review will help those planning transport projects to decide how and when to use green bridges both in England and beyond.” Sheena Crombie, Senior Ecological Advisor at Highways England, said: “Highways England recognises that roads may prevent effective movement for some species around the wider countryside, contributing to habitat fragmentation. Over the years it has investigated the possibility of providing green bridges at key localities but has found two significant problems when considering their construction. One has been a lack of knowledge on how the structures work and function, and secondly the high cost for what were unproven benefits. This document will help to give a better understanding on both these issues, providing clear guidance on the design of green bridges to designers and planners working to improve and enhance the environmental performance of the Strategic Road Network. The publication will add to the knowledge base for civil engineers and the ecological community.” Examples of green bridges England The UK currently has a small number of green bridges. One of the most celebrated spans the A21 at Scotney Castle in Kent in the High Weald Area of Natural Beauty (AONB). Completed in 2005 as part of a dual carriageway by-pass for Lamberhurst, it enabled the historic drive to the castle to be preserved, reduced the impact on local landscape and was soon being used by dormice. In London, a green bridge was built to overcome the fragmentation of Mile End Park by a number of roads and railway lines. Spanning five lanes of the A11, the Mile End green bridge is 25m wide with landscaped parkland. Rainwater runs off the bridge into tanks on either side and is then recycled to maintain the water content of the soil. Europe Green bridges were pioneered in the Netherlands, where at least 47 ecoducts as they are known have been constructed since the first in 1988. One of the earliest ecoducts was the Terlet overpass which is planted with trees. Within six years three species of deer were recorded using it, along with wild boar, red fox, badger, wood mice, common shrew and common vole. Groene Woud ecoduct, also in the Netherlands, has a chain of small pools across the overpass and its access ramps for amphibians. Common toad, common frog, marsh frog, edible frog, smooth newt and great crested newt were all found on the ecoduct. An overpass in Sweden enabled roe deer and moose populations to move around without having to cross the road. Allied to the construction of roadside fences, the overpass led to a 70% reduction in accidents caused by roe deer. Trans-Atlantic Further afield, two green bridges over the Trans Canadian Highway in Banff have allowed sufficient movement of bears to prevent genetic isolation. In Brisbane, the Compton Road faunal overpass closely resembles the dense, surrounding eucalyptus forest and is remarkably similar in species richness. A study found that twice as many species of bird were flying over the bridge as were flying over the road.

/guidance/public-rights-of-way-landowner-responsibilities,"As the owner or occupier of land with a public right of way across it, you must keep the route visible and not obstruct or endanger users. Public rights of way: landowner responsibilities Access and rights of way Natural England These rules apply to agricultural or any other land. Find out if there’s a public right of way on your land Your local authority (national park authorities, county councils, some district councils, metropolitan boroughs or unitary authorities) will normally have a ‘definitive map’ of your area showing public rights of way. Definitive maps are a legal record of public rights of way in 4 categories: footpaths bridleways restricted byways byways open to all traffic Keep public rights of way clear of obstructions As the owner or occupier of land with a public right of way across it, you must: avoid putting obstructions on or across the route, such as permanent or temporary fences, walls, hedgerows, padlocked gates or barbed wire make sure vegetation does not encroach onto the route from the sides or above, bearing in mind the different clearances needed for users of different types of route, for example by horse riders Obstructing a public right of way is a criminal offence. The highway authority has the right to demand you remove any obstruction you cause. If you don’t, the highway authority can remove the obstruction and recover the cost from you. You must not disturb the surface of byways, restricted byways and unsurfaced public roads, eg by cultivating. Field-edge and cross-field public rights of way You must not cultivate (eg plough) footpaths or bridleways that follow a field edge. The minimum width you need to keep undisturbed is: 1.5 metres for a field edge footpath 3 metres for a field edge bridleway You should avoid cultivating a cross-field footpath or bridleway. If you have to cultivate make sure the footpath or bridleway: remains apparent on the ground to at least the minimum width of 1 metre for a footpath or 2 metres for a bridleway, and is not obstructed by crops is restored to at least the minimum width so that it’s reasonably convenient to use within: 14 days of first being cultivated for that crop 24 hours of any subsequent cultivation, unless a longer period has been agreed in advance in writing by the highway authority Waymarking and warning signs If official waymarking leaves it unclear where a public right of way goes, you may add informal waymarks to remedy this so long as these are not misleading. You must indicate the route of a reinstated cross-field footpath or bridleway. If necessary, use signs to warn users of any dangers that are not obvious, such as slurry lagoons. Note that erecting misleading signs (such as signs about absent bulls) is an offence and local authorities have powers to remove them. See Waymarking public rights of way for more details. Structures for access Where a stile or gate on a public right of way is your responsibility, you must maintain it so it is safe and reasonably easy to use. You can claim 25% or sometimes more of the cost of any replacement work from the highway authority. Some authorities provide materials, or others may carry out the work themselves. Where a stile needs replacing, always consider with the highway authority whether to do this with a gate or preferably a gap, so that it will be less of an impediment to people with mobility problems. You must seek the local highway authority’s permission before installing any new structure on a public right of way. Unauthorised structures are obstructions and may be removed by the highway authority at the landowner’s expense. If you add new ditches or widen existing ones (having secured any necessary permissions, including from the highway authority) you must provide adequate bridges for public rights of way users. Cross Compliance requirements See GAEC (Good Agricultural and Environmental Conditions) 7b: Public Rights of Way in The guide to cross compliance in England 2015 for the 4 requirements you must meet. Livestock on land crossed by a public right of way: banned animals Bulls of recognised dairy breeds (Ayrshire, British Friesian, British Holstein, Dairy Shorthorn, Guernsey, Jersey and Kerry) that are over the age of 10 months are banned by law from fields containing a public right of way. Bulls over 10 months of any other breed must be accompanied by cows or heifers when in fields with public access. Make sure that any warning notices relating to a bull are displayed only when it is actually present in a field. Horses may be kept loose in fields crossed by public rights of way, as long as they are not known to be dangerous. You can be prosecuted if you keep any potentially dangerous animal on land crossed by a public right of way. Spraying on land crossed by a public right of way If you have to spray land crossed by a public right of way, use pesticides approved for such use and follow the product instructions. Where a public right of way crosses or runs alongside a field, you can provide an informal alternative route that they can use for this period if you wish, but this does not close the public right of way. If the public are still using the public right of way, despite warning notices, you must stop spraying temporarily. Creating, closing, upgrading, downgrading or re-routing public rights of way Highway authorities have certain powers to make changes to the public right of way networks in their area. You can agree to create a new public right of way or apply to your local authority to make an order extinguishing, diverting, upgrading or downgrading a footpath, bridleway or restricted byway in some circumstances. You can get more information from the rights of way section of the highway authority. See more details about making changes to the legal status of public rights of way . Problems with public rights of way If you experience a problem with a public right of way contact the rights of way section of the highway authority through whose area the route passes."

/government/news/natural-england-doesnt-object-to-proposed-work-at-pagham,"Natural England's desire is to help achieve the best long-term outcome for the local community and the unique environment of Pagham. Natural England doesn't object to proposed work at Pagham  Natural England Pagham in West Sussex has seen the growth of a coastal spit in recent years which has led to increased erosion of the beach and subsequent risk of erosion and flooding to nearby properties. Natural England recognises the problems posed by the coastal erosion at Pagham and is committed to helping the community, the parish council and Arun District Council ( DC ) to reduce the erosion risk to people’s homes. Arun DC , the local authority, has undertaken defence works to protect these properties and Natural England has worked closely with the local community and parish council over several years to advise on the environmental impacts of different options. This stretch of coast is one of the most important in Europe for wildlife, providing habitat for breeding and overwintering birds, aquatic creatures and is one of the best examples in the country of a dynamic coast. This means the area has a number of protections under environmental law. Natural England’s statutory role is to provide advice, so that any impacts on this special wildlife are considered during the planning process. We’ve been working with the community’s representatives, their consultants, the local authorities and Environment Agency on identifying a solution to the erosion and advising how this would affect the special wildlife of the area. The option preferred by the local community is to cut a channel through the spit to decrease erosion at Pagham beach and their planning application is now being considered by the planning authorities (Arun DC , Chichester DC and the Marine Management Organisation). We’ve advised the planning authorities on the steps they should take in relation to the environment before reaching a legally-robust decision. Our official letter of advice, although providing sound information, lacked the degree of clarity we aim for and we are now taking steps to address this and we’ll reissue the letter shortly. It’s important to stress that our advice doesn’t object to or reject the proposal or seek to prevent the proposal going ahead – it’s aimed at ensuring that the consequences for the natural environment are properly considered by the planning authorities in reaching their decision. Our desire is to help achieve the best long-term outcome for the local community and the unique environment of Pagham. In the interim we’ve continued to give consent to beach management works requested by Arun DC to reduce the erosion risk to the properties in the short term."

Route alteration near Micklam Farm A change to the rights of way network in the vicinity of Micklam farm allows for a slightly different route to be followed by coast path walkers in the short to medium term. 17 December 2012 - Natural England published its proposals for improved access to the Cumbrian coast between Allonby and Whitehaven 18 July 2013 - these proposals were approved by the Secretary of State 10 May 2013 - a definitive map modification order had been made confirming the addition of a public bridleway to the definitive map of public rights of way between point A and B near Micklam Farm . Natural England considered proposing that the ECP should follow the disused mineral railway (that now carries the bridleway) between points A and B , but chose not to do so due the apparent likelihood of a development on land at Micklam farm that seemed likely to affect that part of the route. As the proposed development has not yet got underway, Natural England does not intend to undertake establishment works to the approved route of the ECP between points A and B until the situation becomes clearer. Should the development not proceed, Natural England will consider proposing a variation of the approved route, to align the ECP between A and B with the recently confirmed public bridleway.

/government/news/pagham-coastal-spit-planning-application-to-protect-housing-in-west-sussex,"Natural England says it won’t block a planning application to cut through the spit at Pagham, West Sussex.  Pagham coastal spit: planning application to protect housing in West Sussex  Natural England Natural England met local residents in Pagham to confirm it won’t block the planning application submitted by Pagham Parish Council to protect houses from erosion along this dynamic stretch of coastline. The growth in recent years of the coastal spit at Pagham in West Sussex has led to increased erosion of the beach and subsequent risk of erosion and flooding to nearby properties. The local community has campaigned for their preferred option to cut a channel through the spit to decrease erosion at Pagham beach. Natural England’s area manager James Seymour met community representatives in Pagham today (28 January) to share the revised advice Natural England is providing for both Arun and Chichester district councils and the Marine Management Organisation ( MMO ) ‘the planning authorities’. Natural England recognises the significant problems posed by the coastal erosion at Pagham and understand how distressing and difficult it is for those who are affected. Natural England is committed to helping the community in any way that it can to support their search for a solution that ensures protection of properties and the unique environment of Pagham. James Seymour said: We want to make it crystal clear that we are not standing in the way of this planning application. We are confident the work to submit the current application provides a clear basis for addressing the environmental issues. The planning authorities will now be able to consider all aspects of the project. Natural England clarified its advice from earlier this month to make it clear that it can work with the community and authorities to deal with any environmental reasons why planning permission cannot be sought, and help the authorities work through the legal process needed to support a legally robust decision. During the meeting Mr Seymour also reassured residents the consultation regarding a potential new marine Special Protection Area ( SPA ) for foraging terns within the Solent and along the Dorset coast, will not make it harder to get planning permission, as this is already being taken into account. Mr Seymour praised the hard work of the community’s representatives, their consultants, the local authorities and Environment Agency in considering and identifying solutions to protect the wildlife of the area, whilst progressing with the option preferred by the local community to cut a channel through the spit to decrease erosion at Pagham beach. The planning application can now be considered by the planning authorities. Natural England has advised the planning authorities on the steps they should take in relation to the environment before being able to reach a legally-robust decision on the environmental considerations. This stretch of coast is one of the most important in Europe for wildlife, providing habitat for breeding and overwintering birds, aquatic creatures and is one of the best examples in the country of a dynamic coast. This means the area has a number of protections under environmental law. Natural England’s statutory role is to provide advice, so that any impacts on this special wildlife are considered during the planning process. Natural England is now satisfied that those environmental concerns are being considered fully to enable this proposal to proceed. Natural England’s desire is to help achieve the best long-term outcome for the local community and the unique environment of Pagham. In the interim Natural England has continued to give consent to beach management works requested by Arun DC to reduce the erosion risk to the properties in the short term. Further information Contact Natural England senior press officer Heather Duncan on 0300 060 0555 /07775 410 141 for further details: More information is available on the consultation for Solent to Dorset Coast potential SPA . The consultation is open until 21 April 2016. Natural England advises that the MMO will need to undertake a Stage 1 Marine Conservation Zone Assessment test of the potential impacts on the Pagham Harbour Marine Conservation Zone. Natural England advises that the lead authority should undertake an appropriate assessment in accordance with the Habitats Regulations."

England Coast Path: Whitehaven to Silecroft  Natural England  Map of the stretch Since April 2013 Natural England has been preparing proposals to improve public access along a 51 km stretch of the Cumbria coast between Whitehaven and Silecroft. Stage of progress Stage 5: Open On 28 September 2015 the Secretary of State announced her decision to approve a stretch of the England Coast Path in Cumbria between Whitehaven and Silecroft. The original proposals have been modified by the Secretary of State. The changes include minor amendments to the landward boundary of the coastal margin just south of Whitehaven. The landward boundary of the coastal margin now coincides with existing boundary features such as walls and fences. See the consultation outcome page for more information. Next steps Work is now underway to prepare the new stretch of coast path for public use. The first step is to contact owners and occupiers of the affected land to discuss the design and location of any new infrastructure which is needed, such as signs and gates. When preparations are complete, new access rights will come into force along the route and adjoining spreading room. This is expected to be ready in late 2016 or early 2017. Route near river Irt and river Esk The full length of the trail won’t be available for use near the river Irt and the river Esk until new river crossings have been built and nearby sections of the route have been approved. Until this time, no new public access rights will apply on the sections shown on these maps: river Irt to Hall Carleton Walls Bridge to Eskmeals (near the river Esk) Find out more about the England Coast Path See information about all stretches in preparation around England’s coast .

/guidance/open-access-land-and-the-coastal-margin-how-to-restrict-public-access,"As a land manager, understand how to restrict public access to protect visitors, or your use of the land at certain times.  Open access land and the coastal margin: how to restrict public access Access and rights of way Natural England Overview The Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 ( CROW Act) normally gives a public right of access to land mapped as ‘open country’ (mountain, moor, heath and down) or registered common land. These areas are known as ‘open access land’. Much of the ‘coastal margin’ that is being created as part of the work to implement the England Coast Path , is also open access land under the same Act. If you own or have a legal interest in land which has a public right of access under the rights of access under the CROW Act, it may be possible to limit this right at times if necessary. This page explains how. You can’t use these powers to restrict land: along footpaths, bridleways or other public rights of way on open access land that already existed before the CROW Act Restrictions you don’t need to apply for You have the right to exclude or restrict public access to your land in certain circumstances if you are the land owner or farm tenant: ‘28-day’ restrictions You can use these to exclude or restrict public access rights for up to 28 days per calendar year except for land in the coastal margin. If you’re the farm tenant of the land, you, rather than the owner of the land have this 28 day restrictions allowance. These restrictions can’t be used on: bank holidays, Christmas Day or Good Friday Saturdays between 1 June and 11 August Sundays between 1 June and 30 September more than 4 weekend days in any calendar year You have to notify these restrictions to Natural England beforehand. The amount of notice you need to give depends on the circumstances. For more information, contact the Open Access Contact Centre ( OACC ) . Dog control There is a general rule that visitors using their open access rights must keep their dogs on a short lead of no more than 2 metres between 1 March and 31 July each year (except in the coastal margin), and at all times in the vicinity of livestock. In the coastal margin, dogs must be under effective control at all times. In some circumstances you may be entitled to exclude people with dogs completely from: Small lambing fields If you use a field of up to 15 hectares for lambing, you can exclude people with dogs from it for one period of up to 6 weeks in each calendar year if you are the landowner or farm tenant and the land isn’t part of the coastal margin. Grouse moors If the land you own is managed as a grouse moor, you can exclude people with dogs from it for up to 5 years at a time, except along public rights of way. You can find out more about how this works from the OACC . Note that: these restrictions don’t apply to people with registered assistance dogs they can’t be used on land on the ‘coastal margin’, or land with no access rights under the CROW Act. Restrictions you do need to apply for You can apply to restrict public access rights to open access land under the CROW Act if you hold a legal interest in the land. This includes: the owner tenants individuals who hold rights over registered common land individuals or organisations with sporting or other ‘property’ rights over land held under licence or agreement You can apply to restrict access for any period of the year, but only if this is necessary for land management, public safety or fire prevention reasons. Land management You may apply for a restriction for any type of land management activity on access land including: farming forestry sporting activities events If you have rights over an area of registered common land, you may only apply for a restriction directly related to the rights you hold. Natural England may give land management restrictions in the coastal margin with or without an application from the land owner. Public safety restrictions You can’t restrict public access to manage risks to public safety from natural features (eg cliffs or potholes). Visitors to your land should take responsibility to keep themselves and their children safe. You are not liable for any injuries caused by natural landscape features while the public rights of access under the CROW Act apply. In the coastal margin, you are not liable for any damage or injury caused by any physical feature on the land, whether it is a natural feature of the landscape or a man-made one. Relevant authorities may give public safety restrictions on access land without receiving an application where they consider this necessary. The relevant authority is: the national park authority for land within a national park the Forestry Commission for dedicated woodland Natural England for all other open access land in England, and for all land in the coastal margin Fire prevention restrictions Public access to areas mapped as open access land under the CROW Act may be suspended for the purpose of fire prevention in exceptional conditions. These restrictions aim to minimise the risk of accidental fires breaking out. The Met Office has developed a Fire Severity Index ( FSI ) to give an objective method of identifying when exceptional conditions occur. You can view the FSI maps on the Met Office website. If you feel that a fire prevention restriction is required for your land, contact the OACC for more information. You need to do this before exceptional conditions occur, to avoid unnecessary delay at those times. Restrictions for fire prevention may be given by the relevant authority with or without an application from the land manager. They can’t be used along the England Coast Path. Find out if land has pre-existing public access rights Where open access rights existed over your land prior to 2000, they are likely to apply instead of the rights under the CROW Act, and the restriction powers under that Act won’t apply. Land subject to such pre-existing rights is called section 15 land, and you can view maps of these areas on the MAGIC website : Click ‘Get started’. Read the terms and conditions and if acceptable, tick box and click ‘OK’. On the left-hand side of the screen, click the ‘+’ symbol to expand the ‘Access’ section. Select: ‘Countryside and Rights of Way Act, Section 15 Land (England)’. Use the map search or zoom functions to view the area of land you are interested in. Applying for a restriction Restrictions that are needed on access land in the coastal margin will be identified when proposals for the route are published. You can apply to restrict land you own once the England Coast Path is open. Contact the OACC if you want to apply for a restriction. How your application will be assessed If you submit an application, you will receive a decision from the relevant authority within: 6 weeks for applications to restrict public access for less than 6 months 4 months for applications to restrict public access for more than 6 months The relevant authority will decide whether a restriction or exclusion can be issued using the statutory guidance provided by Natural England. Contact the OACC if you want to know more about the statutory guidance. The relevant authority will decide which is the least restrictive option that meets the need without placing a significant cost on the land owner. They may: give the restriction you applied for give a restriction that is different from the one you applied for, but meets the need refuse your application, if it they consider it isn’t necessary The relevant authority must consult with the local access forum and other interested parties for applications involving a potential restriction of more than 6 months. Once the relevant authority has reached a decision they will provide you with details in writing. If you don’t know the exact dates that a restriction will be required in advance, the relevant authority can give an outline restriction if necessary. You will normally then need to notify the OACC once you know when the restriction will be needed. Appealing against the relevant authority’s decision If you disagree with the relevant authority’s decision on your application, you have the right to appeal to the Secretary of State within 6 weeks from the date of the decision by contacting the Planning Inspectorate . Checks on whether the restriction is still needed If you have been given a restriction that lasts for more than 5 years, the relevant authority must review it at least once every 5 years to make sure it is still appropriate. The relevant authority will contact you when your restriction is being reviewed. Relevant authority restrictions In some circumstances the relevant authority can close public access land without you submitting an application. This can be done for: nature conservation heritage preservation fire prevention public safety land management reasons, in the coastal margin saltmarshes and flats in the coastal margin You’ll be contacted by the relevant authority if this applies to your land. The Secretary of State for Defence or the Home Secretary may also restrict public access without receiving an application, for defence or national security reasons. Tell the public about the restriction Restrictions are published by Natural England on the CROW access maps website . You may want to draw attention to restrictions on your land using signs placed where visitors are most likely to try to enter the land. Contact your access authority for more advice. The access authority is either your local county or unitary authority, or where appropriate, the national park authority.

/government/news/england-coast-path-takes-step-forward-as-somerset-section-opens,"Some of Somerset’s most spectacular coastline is open to the public for the first time following the opening of 58 miles of coast path. England Coast Path takes step forward as Somerset section opens  Natural England The new stretch, following two thirds of the county’s coast from Brean Down to Minehead , represents a significant step towards the creation of an England Coast Path. The longest section to be added to the national route so far, it was opened by Natural England’s Chairman, Andrew Sells, at a ceremony in Doniford. Natural England is currently establishing a 2,700 mile continuous path around the entire English coastline by 2020. Work is already under way on more than half the path, described by Andrew Sells as “the most significant rights of way project for a generation.” Speaking in Doniford today, Andrew Sells said: The England Coast Path is a fabulous legacy for our great island nation and I’m delighted to open this new stretch in Somerset. For the first time, people will be able to walk the length of Somerset’s coast along a high-quality footpath and enjoy some stunning new views and coastal wildlife. Visits to the coast remain one of our most popular activities and are worth millions of pounds to our regional economies. Approval for the new stretch in Somerset was granted by the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Elizabeth Truss. Commenting on the approval, Rural Affairs Minister Rory Stewart said: Walkers can now roam the glorious coast all the way from the heights of Brean Down to Exmoor National Park at Minehead, taking in the astonishing beauty of Somerset along the way. Today’s new path adds to over 100 miles of England Coast Path already officially open, giving people all over the country easy access to our spectacular coastline. By 2020, we’ll have opened up a path around the whole of England’s coast, providing a place to rest, relax and admire the view and a destination for bracing, energetic walks, great for nature and for our health. Today’s ceremony means that Somerset’s entire coastline, encompassing glorious beaches, wonderful wildlife and dramatic views, will be open to everyone for the first time. Not only will it allow local people to enjoy the amazing landscape and seascape on their doorstep, it will draw visitors from far and wide, bringing people closer to nature and providing a boost for local businesses. The 15 mile Somerset section of South West Coast Path currently generates around £11.6 million a year for the regional economy, equating to £770,000 for every mile. If that level of success were replicated on the section opened today, over time it would mean the path could generate around £44 million for local businesses each year. According to the South West Research Company, there were more than 7.5 million day visits to Somerset’s coast in 2014, which resulted in spending of more than £260 million. Tourism employs 23,777 people in Somerset, or 4% of the population. According to Natural England’s research, 10% of all visits to the natural environment are to the coast and most of these visits involve a walk or visit to a beach. Tourist services, local businesses and public organisations celebrated alongside walkers at the opening event at Doniford Farm . In Doniford, as part of the new route, a 15 metre footbridge has been built over the river Swill. For the first time, this provides an easy-access walking route between the two sides of the village, allowing those staying at several nearby caravan sites to walk safely to Doniford Farm shop and café, the nearby halt for the West Somerset Railway, or onwards down the coast. It is also the first time such a major piece of infrastructure has been built for the England Coast Path. A local group of Ramblers celebrated by walking a short section of new path on their way to the event. Walkers can enjoy several new sections of path between Watchet and East Quantoxhead, which opens up spectacular new views over the Bristol Channel. Somerset Wildlife Trust has also provided 7 new interpretation boards along the stretch, to reveal more about the stunning wildlife and landscape features that walkers will be able to see and enjoy along ‘Somerset’s brilliant coast.’ This new access joins existing coastal footpaths to create a stretch of high-quality, well-signposted coastal National Trail. Natural England consulted 238 landowners, including 183 businesses, and worked closely with Somerset County Council to plan and create the route. Councillor David Fothergill, Cabinet Member with a responsibility for Highways at Somerset County Council, installed a waymarker on the bridge at the opening ceremony. He said: We are extremely happy to be launching the new section of Coast Path in Somerset. We know how popular they are with both locals and those new or visiting the region, and hope this new path will prove to be a draw for tourists. Supporting the Coast Path brings great economic benefits to the County of Somerset and we look forward to further additions being planned for the future which will complete the England Coast Path in Somerset. Councillor Anthony Trollope-Bellew, Leader of West Somerset Council, said: I am delighted that this section of path is opening in our district. Walking is one of the top activities that visitors come to enjoy in West Somerset. We have some of the most spectacular coastline in the country, and this new route will allow all to experience the fantastic wildlife, heritage and scenery of the area. Tourism is a vitally important industry locally with as many as a third of the local workforce employed in this sector. The path is another attraction to add to the many we are proud of and it will attract more visitors, providing new opportunities for tourism businesses. Steve Clothier, partner at Doniford Farm Park said: Doniford Farm is popular with locals as well as visitors, especially families enjoying a visit to the coast, but most of them arrive here by car. I’m expecting the new path – and especially the new footbridge over the Swill – to bring lots more customers on foot which will be great for us and for all tourist businesses along the Somerset coast. Nicky Philpott, Director of Advocacy and Engagement at the Ramblers, said: We’re delighted to see this new stretch of the England Coast Path opened in Somerset. There is huge public love for our coast and we’ve been leading the campaign for many years to open up our coastline for everyone to enjoy. Today brings us one step closer to achieving this longstanding Ramblers’ dream. Michele Bowe, Somerset Wildlife Trust’s Head of Conservation said: Somerset has stunning wildlife and a rich and varied coastal landscape and we’ve provided some colourful interpretation boards along the coast path which reveal some of the features and species walkers will be able to see. The route will provide an enormous opportunity for all of us to enjoy the outdoors, get reconnected to nature and improve our health and wellbeing. Background information According to figures from the South West Coast Path report Unlocking our Coastal Heritage , the 15 mile Somerset section of South West Coast Path currently generates around £11.6 million a year for the regional economy, equating to £770,000 for every mile.

Once published, the report will be available on GOV.UK and advertised in the local press. Copies of the report will be placed in council offices and other appropriate locations in the local area for people to view. Natural England will contact affected owners and occupiers and the local and national organisations that must be notified by law, to make sure they’re aware that the report has been published. Next steps Stage 4: Determine Once the report has been published, you’ll have 8 weeks to comment on the proposals. Anyone who wishes to comment will be able to make a representation on the report and owners or occupiers of affected land will be able to make an objection. The Secretary of State will consider all representations and objections before making a decision about approval of Natural England’s report.

/government/news/natural-england-launches-south-easts-first-section-of-england-coast-path,"Walkers can enjoy 66 miles of new and improved National Trail with the launch of the first stretch of the England Coast Path in Kent and East Sussex today. Natural England launches south east’s first section of England Coast Path  Natural England The continuous route between Camber and Ramsgate is the first section of the England Coast Path to open in the south east of England. It gives unbridled views of coastline, including the iconic White Cliffs and the unique areas of Dungeness and Pegwell Bay, popular for bird watching, their landscape and their summer flowers. Natural England is currently establishing a 2,700-mile path around the entire English coastline by 2020 and work is already under way on 60 per cent of the route. When completed, it will be the longest continuous coastal walking route in the world. It will also become a National Trail – the nation’s finest and most popular long-distance paths. Speaking at the National Trust’s White Cliffs centre, the Chairman of Natural England, Andrew Sells, said: I am delighted to be here for the formal opening of this 66-mile section of the England Coast Path – the most significant rights of way project for a generation. This beautiful and iconic stretch will allow walkers to enjoy amazing views, fabulous wildlife and places with significant cultural and historical value – all from a high-quality footpath. It will also connect coastal communities and encourage walkers to visit more of the coast, bringing an added economic boost to the region. Dame Helen Ghosh, Director General of the National Trust, said: We are a proud partner in Natural England’s England Coast Path. The path represents one of the biggest steps forward for countryside and coastal access in a generation, making space for nature and people around our shores. The coast path offers the chance to create a corridor for wildlife habitats to recover and thrive, while allowing people to experience natural heritage at first hand. Environment Minister Therese Coffey said: We have already opened up miles of coastal paths across the country, allowing thousands of people to explore and enjoy our spectacular coastline. The White Cliffs of Dover are one of our country’s most iconic and instantly recognisable landmarks, and with none of us living further than 75 miles from the sea – many much closer – opening this path will allow more people than ever before to experience this national treasure first-hand. The route provides a link between communities and towns along the coast including Camber and Lydd, Greatstone and Hythe and Deal and Sandwich. It includes areas of great heritage: from the supposed landing site of Caesar at Walmer to embarkation points on the River Stour at Richborough used by soldiers and horses in the First World War; and from Napoleonic Martello towers dotted along the coast near Dymchurch to extensive Second World War defences at Dover, such as Winston Churchill’s tunnels inside the cliffs at Fan Bay. Three miles of new path have also been created at Sandwich, giving access around the peninsula for the first time. Walkers can enjoy new views along the River Stour across Pegwell Bay towards the cliffs at Ramsgate and overlook the wonderful National Nature Reserve of Sandwich and Pegwell Bay. Latest Natural England research (2016 Coastal Analysis of Monitoring of Engagement with the Natural Environment) due to be published this summer, shows 313 million visits were made to the English coast between March 2014 and February 2015. Findings also show that between March 2009 and February 2015, there was a 138 per cent increase in visits to paths, cycleways and bridleways at coastal locations. On average, during the same period (2009 to 2015) £18 was spent on coastal visits, compared to £6 on a visit to the countryside. The creation of coastal paths in other parts of the country suggests the new path in Kent and Sussex will bring clear benefits to the local economy. According to figures from the South West Coast Path report Unlocking Our Coastal Heritage , the National Trail is worth £400 million a year to the regional economy, equating to £630,000 per mile. Cross-channel visitors will be able to step off the ferry at Dover or Ramsgate and straight onto the England Coast Path. According to Visit Kent, access to the coast and its natural and cultural attractions generates a significant part of the county’s £3.4 billion tourism industry. Natural England has worked closely with Kent County Council and East Sussex County Council, who have made the path ready to open today. Clive Pearman, Kent County Council’s Deputy Cabinet Member for Environment and Transport, said: The opening of this section of the coastal path will give local residents and visitors alike the opportunity to enjoy the outdoors, with its stunning views and scenery, and the unique wildlife, in its many forms, which frequents this coastal region. This is a wonderful opportunity for everyone, and we hope that this section of the coastal path invites many of the visitors to our county to step beyond the traditional visitor attractions to both enjoy this area, and thereby to contribute to the economic growth of Kent. Background information One in ten visits to the natural environment is a visit to the coast. Most visits to the coast are to walk or go to the beach ( MENE ). Natural England is working on 5 stretches of the Kent coast ; 2 of those open today and we expect the remaining ones to open over the next couple of years. The next section of coast path opens in 2 days time, on 21 July 2016 in Middlesbrough. It will be 68 miles long and stretch from Filey in North Yorkshire to Newport Bridge in Middlesbrough. The England Coast Path #EnglandCoastPath also gives walkers new rights of access to typical coastal land including foreshore, beaches, dunes and cliffs, including areas where everyone can rest, relax and admire the view. And, crucially, the path will now be able to ‘roll back’ as the cliffs erode or slip – enabling a replacement route to be put in place quickly if necessary, so solving longstanding difficulties with maintaining a continuous route along the coast. Natural England worked with 421 landowners and 150 businesses between Camber and Ramsgate including beach-side properties, commercial ports and farmers. The proposals for the route were published between 2013 and 2014 when landowners and those with interests were able to make objections or representations. The route was scrutinised by an independent Planning Inspector and recommended with one small change to access at Richborough and approved by the Secretary of State. Stunning drone footage of the route is available on our YouTube channel ."

Coastal Access in Kent: Folkestone to Ramsgate  Natural England On 28 October 2013 Natural England submitted a report to the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs setting out our proposals for improved access to the Kent coast between Folkestone and Ramsgate. The period for making formal representations and objections on our final report will close at 5pm on Sunday 22 December 2013. Under the Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009, Natural England has a statutory duty to improve access to the English coast. As well as securing a long-distance route around the whole of the coast, its role is to provide improved levels of access for local residents and visitors where they can walk, rest and admire the view. The report outlines key improvements to existing access along the coast in Kent between Folkestone and Ramsgate, with proposals: to identify a clear and continuous walking route along this part of the coast, bringing sections of existing coastal footpath closer to the sea; to allow the route to ‘roll back’ if the coastline erodes or slips, solving the long-standing difficulties of maintaining a continuous route along the coast; and to secure statutory rights of public access to areas of beach, cliff and coastal land for the first time in places where people currently enjoy access by long tradition or with the landowners’ permission."

/government/news/longest-section-of-england-coast-path-opens-in-middlesbrough,"Natural England today opens the latest stretch of England Coast Path in Middlesbrough, bringing an economic boost to the region. Longest section of England Coast Path opens in Middlesbrough  Natural England Sixty eight miles of sign posted National Trail will give walkers new and improved access and connect the urban heartland of Teesside to its open coast. The continuous route starts at Filey Brigg and passes north through the popular resorts of Scarborough and Whitby, Saltburn and Redcar, providing stunning views of the North York Moors and coastline. It follows much of the well-known coastal section of Cleveland Way National Trail with improvements to the route. Natural England is currently establishing a 2,700-mile path around the entire English coastline by 2020 and work is already under way on 60 per cent of the route. When completed, it will be the longest continuous coastal walking route in the world. It will also become a National Trail – the nation’s finest and most popular long-distance paths. Natural England’s Chief Executive, James Cross, said: It’s an honour to open this section of coast path near my home town in Teesside. This route showcases the diversity of our coastline, from the views over the expansive North York Moors and the winding streets of postcard-perfect villages to our industrial heritage, and diverse wildlife all year round. We want people to enjoy exploring all of this coast, using a high-quality, well-signposted route. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs also today confirmed that an additional 8 mile section between Newport Bridge and North Gare - which links the previously open 34 miles of coast path in Durham with the new section opening today – has also been approved and is expected to formally open next year. Walkers will then be able to enjoy 110 miles of continuous England Coast Path from Filey Brigg to South Bents. Environment Minister Thérèse Coffey said: With none of us living further than 75 miles from the sea – many much closer – thousands of people are already exploring and enjoying our spectacular coastline thanks to new stretches of coastal path across the country. Middlesbrough’s old docklands and harbours represent an important and iconic part of the region’s history, and this picturesque stretch of coastline will allow the generations of our future to connect with the landscapes of our past. This is the second stretch of England Coast Path to open in the north east of England and is the longest one in the country so far; the second longest – a 66 mile stretch – opened in Kent this week . A small section of new access has been created near Staithes, where the trail has been brought closer to the headland, and opened new and spectacular views down into the harbour. North of Saltburn, where the Cleveland Way turns inland, the route continues through Marske to Redcar along open coast, before turning west to follow The Teesdale Way. Walkers will enjoy the fascinating industrial heritage of the Tees Estuary before arriving in the historical centre of Middlesbrough. Thanks to funding from Tata Steel and Redcar and Cleveland Borough Council, a footbridge to the east of Lord McGowan Bridge has been restored in order to re-establish the “Black Path”, a previously blocked section of the Teesdale Way. Signposting along the entire route and some improvements to surfaces will enable walkers to navigate the route with confidence. Attending the event, Middlesbrough Mayor Dave Budd, said: We are delighted this route through Middlesbrough is the latest in the England Coast Path project to be opened up to the public. Around the various beauty spots of our town we have many marked walking routes which are very popular so to be able to add this new path, with its dramatic vistas and route past the Newport and Transporter Bridges, is fantastic. When we talk of the things which make Middlesbrough a great place to live we are always quick to highlight the places on our doorstep, such as the coast, the moors, the seaside villages, so we want to thank Natural England for making this path a reality. Sir Gary Verity, Chief Executive of Welcome to Yorkshire, said: The North Yorkshire coastline boasts some of the finest scenery in the UK and includes the second most popular holiday destination outside London – Scarborough – so it is terrific to see new and improved access to attract even more visitors and boost the economy. Latest Natural England research (2016 Coastal Analysis of Monitoring of Engagement with the Natural Environment) due to be published this summer, shows 313 million visits were made to the English coast between March 2014 and February 2015. Findings also show that between March 2009 and February 2015, there was a 138 per cent increase in visits to paths, cycleways and bridleways at coastal locations. On average, during the same period (2009 to 2015) £18 was spent on coastal visits, compared to £6 on a visit to the countryside. The creation of coastal paths in other parts of the country suggests the new path in North Yorkshire and Middlesbrough will bring clear benefits to the local economy. According to figures from the South West Coast Path report Unlocking Our Coastal Heritage , the National Trail is worth £400 million a year to the regional economy, equating to £630,000 per mile. According to counters on the previously opened South Bents to North Gare route, 10,000 people a year have enjoyed access to the coast and cliffs in a location which was previously inaccessible. In addition to Middlesbrough Borough Council, Natural England also worked closely with three other local authorities to plan and prepare the route. Malcolm Hodgson, National Trails Officer for the Cleveland Way based within the North York Moors National Park said: Three of the top four views in Yorkshire are along the Cleveland Way National Trail according to a recent poll. Now that the trail is also part of the England Coast Path, and with a stunning new view of Staithes open to walkers, there’s a chance we could claim all top 4 spots! North Yorkshire County Councillor Don Mackenzie, Executive Member for Access to the Countryside said: Walking is an extremely popular activity with tourists and locals in North Yorkshire, and this path will offer visitors and residents alike a new way to enjoy the county’s beautiful coastline and take in the wildlife and heritage along its length. Tourism is hugely important to North Yorkshire and this high-profile new route offers fresh opportunities for tourism businesses. In addition, the path provides a new way for locals to enjoy the health benefits of walking. Cllr Carl Quartermain, cabinet member for jobs, skills and leisure at Redcar and Cleveland Borough Council said: We are delighted to be supporting Natural England with the creation of its 2,700 mile-long coastal footpath, which is cutting through some of the most scenic areas of Redcar and Cleveland. Our borough has a stunning coastline and beautiful countryside, and we hope this new right of access will encourage more visitors to come and enjoy it. Background information The England Coast Path #EnglandCoastPath gives walkers new rights of access to typical coastal land including foreshore, beaches, dunes and cliffs; including areas where everyone can rest, relax and admire the view. And, crucially, the path will now be able to ‘roll back’ as the cliffs erode or slips – enabling a replacement route to be put in place quickly if necessary, and so solving longstanding difficulties with maintaining a continuous route along the coast. Tourism in Yorkshire is worth £7 billion annually and employs almost a quarter of a million people. The north Yorkshire and Middlesbrough coastline already attracts millions of people every year who enjoy visiting the popular destinations of Scarborough, Whitby and Saltburn. Welcome to Yorkshire estimate that just under 6 million tourism day trips were made to Scarborough in 2014 and day trip expenditure per head increased. Natural England is working on 3 stretches of the north east coast , and we expect the remaining ones to open over the next couple of years. Drone footage and photos of the coastline are available on Natural England’s YouTube channel ."

Catch with traps Traps should be placed at least 150mm below ground in the main tunnel of a mole run. You should check traps at least once a day. You can use spring traps, but you must: only use spring traps commonly used for catching moles humanely kill any live moles you catch Control with gas You should use someone trained in the use of gassing products if you choose this method of control. See the HSE information sheet: Gassing of rabbits and vertebrate pests for more information. Control with repellents There are no commercially available repellents approved for use against moles. Mink Catch with traps Mink can be effectively trapped in the mating season (February to March) and when their young leave the den (August to November).

If you have any queries about the confidentiality of information you might provide, please email volunteer.enquiries@naturalengland.org.uk . Handling confidential information You may have access to confidential information, such as names and addresses of private individuals or locations of threatened species, while volunteering with Natural England. Natural England asks all of its volunteers to respect the confidentiality of such information, both during and after the completion of their placement. Equal opportunities It’s Natural England’s policy that all eligible people will have an equal opportunity for placement as a volunteer on the basis of their ability. This policy applies to all volunteers, irrespective of their sex, sexual orientation, marital status, age, disability, race, colour, religion, belief, nationality, ethnic or national origins. Natural England: will treat its volunteers fairly, and understands that combining home and work life with a voluntary role is sometimes difficult will always respect the right of the volunteer to decline a task at any time believes that its volunteers should reflect our constituency of support in the local community - building the diversity of our volunteers is an important part of involving local people in our work If you would like more information on equal opportunities, please email the volunteering team volunteer.enquiries@naturalengland.org.uk . Claim out-of-pocket expenses Contact your Natural England volunteer supervisor for a volunteer expenses claim form. Volunteering while claiming benefits Volunteering may affect any entitlement to benefits unless you follow a few basic rules for good practice. If you are in receipt of benefits, you should check with the relevant local benefits office whether there are any restrictions on the type and quantity of voluntary work you can be involved. The following information will be useful when you inform the benefits office that you plan to, or are already registered as a volunteer with us as you: aren’t required to provide any minimum amount of commitment have no obligation to remain a volunteer for any length of time must not receive more than out-of-pocket expenses Insurance In the event of personal, or third party, accident or injury Natural England ‘self-insures’ both volunteers and staff in the same manner (incidents are dealt with on a case-by-case basis). This means that provided volunteers have not behaved negligently, have acted in good faith and followed all guidelines or instructions provided by an authorised person, Natural England will endeavour to support them in the same manner as it supports its staff. Incidents or accidents, no matter how small or seemingly insignificant, must be reported as soon as possible to Natural England following the accident reporting guidelines. Driving vehicles Natural England promotes the use of public transport wherever possible. However, where the use of public transport is impractical, volunteers may prefer to use their own vehicles. Private vehicles If you use your car during your voluntary role - for example to travel to and from a site - you must inform your motor insurance company. Most national insurance companies recognise that, as drivers do not make a profit from voluntary work, it’s not a ‘business use’ of a vehicle and therefore recommend that existing insurance premiums should not be affected. The standard mileage rate for reimbursement, used by Natural England is classified as a non-profit rate by the Inland Revenue, under the Fixed Profit Car Scheme. For information about business use insurance, see insurance and claiming expenses . If you still have queries then contact your supervisor or support adviser. Average running costs The 45 pence standard mileage rate offered by Natural England is sufficient to cover average running costs. The Automobile Association (AA) website gives details of average running expenses. This includes fuel, oil, tyres, servicing, repairs and replacements (it does not include standing costs of car ownership such as finance, road tax, insurance, breakdown cover or depreciation). Maintenance responsibilities Volunteers are responsible for the maintenance of their cars. Natural England accepts no responsibility for costs incurred for MOTs, insurance, servicing, repair, breakdown cover, depreciation, oil or fuel."

/government/news/walkers-to-enjoy-new-stretch-of-coast-path-in-norfolk,"A stretch of England Coast Path opens in Norfolk as new figures reveal people make over 300 million visits a year to England's coast. Walkers to enjoy new stretch of coast path in Norfolk  Natural England With walking found to be the most popular activity at the coast, the opening of the route in Great Yarmouth by Lord Gardiner of Kimble and Natural England Chairman Andrew Sells means many more people can enjoy our stunning coastlines. The 21 mile route between Hopton-on-Sea and Sea Palling includes 3 new miles of access between Horsey and Sea Palling, where walkers and wildlife watchers will enjoy a beautiful and quieter section of Norfolk’s coastline, some of it for the first time. They will also be able to explore towns and villages along the way, including Gorleston-on-Sea, Great Yarmouth, Caister-on-Sea and Hemsby, benefiting local economies. Natural England’s Chairman, Andrew Sells, speaking at the opening in Great Yarmouth today, said: The England Coast Path is a fabulous legacy for our great island nation. The latest section opening here today is a wonderful showcase for Norfolk’s varied coastline, from historic towns and villages to stunning wildlife and beautiful beaches. Opening up the route will also bring huge benefits to the regional economy - our evidence shows walking is the most popular activity at the coast and we spend more time and money when we visit. Set to visit the coastal stretch today, Lord Gardiner of Kimble, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at Defra, said: With this section of coast path opening in Norfolk today, I am delighted even more miles of our beautiful coastline will be open for people to enjoy, giving everyone a chance to take in even more of our breath-taking scenery. The England Coast Path is a stunning location for people to visit, and has many benefits, including improving our physical and mental wellbeing. Natural England worked with Norfolk County Council to establish the route. Also speaking at the event, Norfolk County Council Chairman David Collis said: This 21-mile path opens up a new route taking in varied views such as the spectacular wide golden sands of Great Yarmouth and the wildlife rich dunes at Horsey so I’d urge people to visit and discover more of our beautiful county. Whether you are ambitious enough to complete the whole new stretch in a day, or simply want to get out and walk off a hearty lunch, it’s a perfect excuse to explore the stunning Norfolk coast. Jonathan Stratford, General Manager at Haven’s Hopton Holiday Village said: We are delighted to hear of the opening of the England Coast Path between Hopton-on-Sea and Sea Palling as it is a project that we have been actively supporting over the last couple of years. We encourage all our guests to explore the local area and this coastal path gives everyone the chance to discover more of this picturesque and unique coastline with ease. The opening of new trail coincides with the publication of Natural England’s latest evidence report Monitoring of Engagement with the Natural Environment – Visits to coastal England . It shows visitors travel from further afield to reach the coast and visit for relaxation and well-being. They spend up to 3 times more money at a coastal destination than an inland one (£18 compared with £6). This is the second stretch of the England Coast Path to open in Norfolk following the 26 miles established between Weybourne and Sea Palling in December 2014. It also marks 30 years since the Norfolk Coast Path National Trail, from Cromer to Hunstanton, was opened by HRH The Prince of Wales. Taken together, the paths cover 83 miles around the Norfolk coast as far as Hunstanton, creating the longest section of coast path in the east of England. Natural England is currently establishing a 2,700-mile path around the entire English coastline by 2020 and work is already under way on over 60 per cent of the route. When completed, it will be the longest continuous coastal walking route in the world. It will also become a National Trail – the nation’s finest and most popular long-distance paths.

After considering these objections, the inspector was minded to determine that Natural England’s proposals do not strike a fair balance in respect to 2 objections and invited further representations on these objections. See the notices for more details. The opportunity to submit a representation is now closed. The objection by Ilchester Estates is being considered at a public inquiry . The inquiry began on 1 November 2016 at Dorchester Town Hall. It will resume there at 10am on 13 December 2016. Following the inquiry, the inspector will make recommendations to the Secretary of State in respect of all the objections. The Secretary of State will then consider all the representations and objections before making a decision about Natural England’s report. Next steps Stage 5: Open Once the Secretary of State has approved the report, Natural England will start work with Dorset County Council on preparing the route for public use. The first step will be to contact owners and occupiers of the affected land to discuss the design and location of any new infrastructure which is required such as signs and gates. When preparations are complete, new access rights will come into force along the route and adjoining spreading room. This is expected to happen later in 2016.

/guidance/comply-with-the-compulsory-beef-labelling-scheme,"You must batch and label the beef and veal you sell or supply according to specific rules, which vary from product to product. Comply with the Compulsory Beef Labelling Scheme  Rural Payments Agency The Compulsory Beef Labelling Scheme rules apply to anyone selling or supplying fresh or frozen beef or veal anywhere in the supply chain. Every food business that sells or supplies these meats must set up a traceability system (also called a traceability control system). The records that make up the traceability system contain reference numbers linking the traceability information to the labels on the beef. This ensures that wherever beef or veal is sold, it can be traced back to where it originated. Who the scheme applies to The scheme rules apply to all: abattoirs or slaughterhouses (regardless of the number of animals they slaughter) cutting plants cold stores repackaging centres butchers’ shops mobile shops market stalls supermarkets farm shops suppliers to hotels, restaurants and other catering facilities The rules don’t apply to businesses dealing solely in cooked beef. Which products the rules apply to You must apply the labelling rules to fresh and frozen beef products including: whole carcases carcase quarters fresh or frozen bone-in/boneless beef cuts, including joints, steak and dice mince (containing less than 1% salt) uncooked beefburger patties with no added ingredients (like soya protein or cereal binder) veal The rules don’t apply to: uncooked meat that has been seasoned either in depth or over the whole surface so that it can be seen by the naked eye or clearly tasted beef and veal in processed products and offal – eg processed beefburgers and steak and kidney pies What you must put on the labels If you are labelling beef (except mince or trimmings) you must include these indications: a reference number or code the name of the member state or non-EU country in which the animal or group of animals were born the name of the member state or non-EU country in which the animal or group of animals were raised the words ‘Slaughtered in: [name of member state or non-EU country]’ the licence number of the slaughterhouse – this doesn’t apply to beef sold loose over the counter the words ‘Cutting/cut in: [name of member state or non-EU country]’ licence number(s) of the cutting plant(s) – this doesn’t apply to beef sold loose over the counter You can download more detailed guidance about: [InlineAttachment:2] [InlineAttachment:4] If you make any additional claims on your labels, you must make sure that any information added meets the requirements of the current food labelling legislation. You can find more information about this under ‘ food labelling and packaging ’. Download [InlineAttachment:3]. Where to put the labelling information You must label pre-wrapped beef on its outermost packaging – either on each individual package of meat or on the outer carton, if you are selling more than one package in a carton. If you are selling non-pre-wrapped beef you must display the labelling information clearly so that customers can see which information relates to which meat. You can do this in 1 of 4 ways: on the meat on a container holding the meat in the shop – eg on a ticket near the meat on a sign on a wall that your customers can see As well as these specific labels, you must apply the Compulsory Beef Labelling Scheme rules to all written information about the meat that you give to customers at the point of sale, eg: advertisements posters announcements leaflets Definitions You must apply the beef labelling rules according to the definitions set out in EU law. Where a definition is specific to a type of product, it is given in the section about that product below. There are 4 more general definitions to be aware of. They are given here. Batch A batch is legally defined as meat, on the bone or boned eg carcases, quarters or boned pieces of meat, cut up, minced or packed together under practically identical conditions. Cut meat Cut meat is legally defined as meat that: has been cut into small cubes, slices or other individual portions doesn’t require further cutting by an operator before being bought by the final consumer can be directly used by the final consumer Retail Retail is legally defined as the handling and/or processing of meat and its storage at the point of sale or delivery to the final consumer, including caterers, company canteens, institutional catering, restaurants and other similar food service operations, shops, supermarket distribution centres and wholesale outlets The final consumer The final consumer is legally defined as the ultimate consumer of cut meat who does not use it as part of a food business operation or activity Pre-packed cut meat Pre-packed (also known as pre-packaged) cut meat is legally defined as the individual pack offered unaltered to the final consumer or to an establishment engaged solely in retail sales, made up of cut meat and the packaging in which it was packed before being offered for sale, whether the packaging covers it fully or partially, but such that the content cannot be altered without opening or changing the packaging. Batching rules When producing cut meat, you are allowed to make up batches using meat from animals slaughtered at a maximum of 3 different abattoirs. You can also make batches from carcases cut up at a maximum of 3 different cutting plants. Any batch of cut meat produced from up to 3 different abattoirs/cutting plants must go straight to retail packaging. Labelling rules When labelling pre-packed cut meat from up to 3 slaughterhouses or up to 3 cutting plants, you must include the: reference number or code name of the member state or non-EU country in which the animals were born name(s) of the member state or non-EU country in which the animals were raised words ‘Animals in the group slaughtered in: [name of member state or non-EU country of slaughter]’ licence number(s) of the slaughterhouse(s) concerned words ‘Cutting of meat in batch in: [name of member state or non-EU country of cutting]’ licence number(s) of the cutting plant(s) Non-pre-packed cut meat Non-pre-packed cut meat is legally defined as cut meat displayed for sale non-pre-packaged in outlets for sale to the final consumer and all pieces of meat displayed for sale non pre-packaged in outlets for sale to the final consumer, intended to be cut at the request of the final consumer. When displaying non-pre-packed cut meat you must keep the meat of animals born and/or raised and/or slaughtered in different countries clearly separated from each other. You must label each group of meat with the country of: birth rearing (if the animals were reared in more than one country, you must list all countries) slaughter carcase cutting If you sell non-pre-packed cut beef displayed together, each day you must record, with the date, the: licence number(s) of the slaughterhouse(s) licence number(s) of the cutting plant(s) You must give this information to any customer who asks for it. Minced beef Minced meat is legally defined as any meat that: Any boned meat that has been minced into fragments. falls within one of the CN (combined nomenclature) codes referred to in Article 12 of Regulation (EC) 1760/2000 contains less than 1% salt Batching rules When mincing beef, you must clean the mincing machine between batches if the animals in the first batch were slaughtered in a different country from the animals in the second. Each batch of mince must originate in only one country. You must not mix raw beef mince from two or more different countries of slaughter. If you sell mixed minced meat and most of it is made up of beef – eg 60% beef and 40% pork – you must follow the compulsory minced beef labelling rules. You are allowed to mix offal with a majority proportion of raw beef mince from the same country. If you do you must follow the labelling rules for minced beef. Labelling rules When labelling minced beef you must include, as a minimum, the: reference number or code – a traceability reference number or code that links back to the source animal, group of animals or batches of beef used for mincing member state or non-EU country of slaughter – you must include the words ‘Slaughtered in: [name of member state or non-EU country]’ member state or non-EU country of mincing – you must include the words ‘Minced in [name of member state or non-EU country]’ member state(s) or non-EU country (or countries) where the animal(s) lived from birth to slaughter, if different from the country of mincing – you must include the words ‘Origin: [name of member state and/or non-EU country]’, or ‘Origin: Non-EC’ if the country is outside the EU In addition, if you want to you can also include the: licence number(s) of the slaughterhouse(s) words ‘Cutting/cut in: [name of member state or non-EU country]’ licence number(s) of the cutting plant(s) date of mincing Trimmings Trimmings are legally defined as small pieces of meat recognised as fit for human consumption produced exclusively during trimming operations during the boning of carcases and/or the cutting up of meat. When making up batches, you must treat trimmings in the same way as minced beef but you only need to follow the rule relating to a single country of slaughter. When labelling trimmings you must include the: reference number or code name(s) of the country or countries in which the animals in the group were born and raised – you must include the words ‘Born and raised in: [names of the countries in which the animals were born and raised]’ name of the country of slaughter of the animals – you must include the words ‘Slaughtered in: [name of member state or non-EU country of slaughter]’; if the country of birth, rearing and slaughter is the same for all animals in the group you can use the words ‘Country of origin: [name of member state or non-EU country in which birth, rearing and slaughter took place] name of the country of production of the trimmings – you must include the words ‘Produced in: [name of member state or non-EU country of production]’ approval number of the plant where the trimmings were produced Meat from bovine animals aged less than 12 months At the time of slaughter, you should classify all bovine animals aged less than 12 months into one of two categories: Category V: bovine animals aged less than 8 months Category Z: bovine animals aged from 8 months to less than 12 months – specifically bovines from the day they reach the age of 8 months until the day before they reach the age of 12 months When making this decision, you should use the information in the animals’ passports. If this isn’t possible, you should use the data in the Cattle Tracing System . Labelling rules for carcases You must apply the category identification letters ‘V’ or ‘Z’ immediately after slaughter by labelling or stamping them onto the outside surface of the carcase. The labels must be not less than 50 cm2 and the stamped letters not less than 2 cm high. You must apply the labels or stamps to the hindquarters and the forequarters: on the striploin at the level of the 4th lumbar vertebra on the brisket between 10 cm and 30 cm from the cut edge of the sternum Download [InlineAttachment:3], including carcase labels. Apply the permitted sales descriptions At each stage of production and marketing, you must clearly label the meat to indicate the age of the animals when they were slaughtered, and its sales description. At the point of sale of the meat to the final consumer, you must present this information on the same label, and so that the consumer can see it all at once. Before the meat reaches the customer you can use either category identification letters ‘V’ or ‘Z’, or one of two wordings: ‘age on slaughter: less than 8 months’ ‘age on slaughter: from 8 months to less than 12 months’ When the meat is released to the final customer you must use the appropriate ‘age on slaughter’ wording, rather than the category identification letters. For meat marketed in the UK, the EU sales descriptions are: ‘veal’ for meat from animals slaughtered aged less than 8 months ‘beef’ for meat from animals slaughtered aged from 8 months to less than 12 months For other EU member states, you must label the meat with the relevant sales description for each member state where it is being marketed. Sales descriptions vary between member states. They are laid down in Part III of Annex VII to Regulation (EC) No 1308/2013 . This means that the meat could have two or more different labels at the same time covering the sales descriptions in different member states. Rules on mixing meat from bovine animals 12 months or less With the exception of offal, you are not allowed to mix meat from bovine animals aged less than 8 months and aged 8 to 12 months. The purpose of the rules is to separate the two types of meat by age into veal and beef. When these types of meat are in chillers, you don’t need to keep them separate. You are allowed to mix batches of offal from bovine animals under 8 months and aged 8 to 12 months as long as you: include both sales descriptions and age brackets on the label identify the ages with either the category identification letters ‘V’ or ‘Z’ or the age descriptions at each stage of production and marketing – except on release to the final customer when descriptions must be used use the wording ‘calves liver’ only for liver from animals aged less than 8 months Download [InlineAttachment:3], including display labels for meat from animals aged 12 months or less. Add supplementary information to labels If you want to use additional wording you must make sure that it meets the requirements of the current food labelling legislation. You can find more information about this under ‘ food labelling and packaging ’. If you want to use the term ‘rosé veal’ your labels, check the current food labelling legislation to see what you need to do. Beef imported from the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands There is a special rule for the labelling of: beef imported from the Isle of Man or the Channel Islands beef from cattle born and raised in the Isle of Man or the Channel Islands but subsequently slaughtered in the UK Although the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands are not part of the UK, the EU recognises them as part of the UK member state for these purposes. Beef that falls into the above categories should therefore be labelled with ‘UK’ under the [InlineAttachment:5]. Beef imported from a non-EU country If you are importing beef from a non-EU country and you do not have all the compulsory labelling information, you use must use the following words as a minimum: ‘Origin: Non-EU’ ‘Slaughtered in [name of non-EU country]’ You should also supply a reference number or code when the beef is cut or repackaged after import."
/guidance/olive-oil-regulations-and-inspections,"Bottlers, retailers, marketers or distributors of olive oil must make sure the oil, its labelling and packaging, comply with regulations. This applies throughout the EU if the oil is packaged for sale (including online sale) to the consumer. Olive oil regulations and inspections Import, export and distribution of food Rural Payments Agency Olive oil composition and characteristics The chemical and sensory characteristics of olive oil products must meet the requirements (for their description) in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2568/91 as amended. Olive oil labelling, packaging and sealing The following oils must meet labelling, packaging and sealing requirements under Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 29/2012 (as amended) and Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council : extra virgin olive oil virgin olive oil olive oil composed of refined olive oils and virgin olive oils olive pomace oil Labelling Olive oil labels must match the product and must meet the requirements of the regulations. If olive oil products are marketed in the UK, all the information that must be on the label must be in English or must include an English version. Regulation 29/2012 states what information must be on the label, and what optional information can also be included. Article 3 states what information must be on the label for certain categories of olive oil Article 4 states that labels for ‘extra virgin olive oil’ and ‘virgin olive oil’ must show a ‘designation of origin’ Article 4 states that labels for ‘olive oil composed of refined olive oils and virgin olive oils’ or ‘olive-pomace oil’ mustn’t show a ‘designation of origin’ Article 4a states that the label must show any special conditions for how the oil should be preserved, for example, that they must be stored away from light and heat Article 4b states that certain mandatory wording must be grouped together where it can be seen clearly. It must also be the same text and size Article 5 explains what you must do if you want to include optional information on a label Packaging and sealing Under Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 29/2012, Article 2, olive oil must be sold in a ‘sealed’ bottle or container that can’t be ‘re-sealed’ after the first time it’s opened. ‘Sealed’ here refers to a tamper-proof seal fitted at the bottling stage. It isn’t the replacing of a screw top or cork. This is to make sure that oil isn’t tampered with after bottling. Labelling of blends and foodstuff If olive oil products are marketed in the UK, all the information that must be on the label must be in English or must include an English version. Regulation 29/2012 states what information can appear on the labels of blends (olive oil and other vegetable oils) and foodstuff with a presence of olive oil. Article 6.1 states: what words can be used to describe the blend when an image or graphic can be used what information must be on the label if these words, images or graphics have been used (other than in the list of ingredients) Article 6.2 states: what words can be used to describe the foodstuff what information must be on the label if these words and any images or graphics have been used (other than in the list of ingredients) Infused (flavoured) olive oils If the olive oil has been infused with other substances, the sales name on the label mustn’t show terms for pure olive oil. For example, you mustn’t use ‘extra virgin olive oil infused with garlic’. Regulation 1308/2013, Article 78(2) and Part VIII of Annex VII, state that the following terms can only be used with oils in their pure form: ‘extra virgin olive oil’ ‘virgin olive oil’ ‘olive oil composed of refined olive oils and virgin olive oils’ ‘olive pomace oil’ Also, you mustn’t use additional wording that is restricted for use with pure olive oils under Commission Implementing Regulation 29/2012. For example, in the case of extra virgin olive oil, you mustn’t use the words ‘superior category olive oil obtained directly from olives and solely by mechanical means’ if the oil is infused or flavoured. Outside of the sales name, general food information regulations apply. Local authorities are responsible for these. If information on the label or packaging doesn’t comply with the regulations, bottlers must correct the label as soon as possible. However, if the information is shown beside the product (for example, a sign on a shelf or attached to an ‘on tap’ container), the retailer must correct the sign/label information immediately. ‘On tap’ olive oil Pure oil These oils mustn’t be sold ‘on tap’ in their pure form: extra virgin olive oil virgin olive oil olive oil composed of refined olive oils and virgin olive oils olive pomace oil Infused (flavoured) oil Olive oils infused with other substances such as garlic or chilli (flavoured olive oils), can be sold ‘on tap’. However, the information above under ‘Infused (flavoured) olive oils’ applies to the labelling of these products. Records that bottlers must keep Anyone holding olive oil, from extraction up to, and including, the bottling stage must keep entry and withdrawal registers for each category of oil they hold. Under Statutory Instrument (SI) 2014/195 the register must show: details of each delivery details of each despatch or disposal details of any processing undertaken (such as blending or bottling) a calculation of stocks held at the end of each month a record of actual, physical stocks held at the end of each accounting period Inspections Under Statutory Instrument (SI) 2014/195, Rural Payments Agency (RPA) inspectors can legally carry out inspections at the premises of any bottlers, marketers, retailers or distributors of olive oil. They’ll take samples of oil and check labels and records. The inspector will: select the olive oil for chemical and sensory testing and take the necessary samples check olive oil labels to make sure they comply with the labelling requirements examine your entry and withdrawal register, if you are a bottler check that you have documents showing your supplier, so the olive oil can be traced. If you can’t supply this information, the inspector will give you 28 days to provide it to the RPA Olive Oil Sampling Manager You won’t be paid for oil taken during an inspection. Once a sample has been tested by the laboratory, RPA will tell you the results and outcome by letter or email. If you don’t agree with the chemical or sensory analysis of your sample, you can write to RPA within 14 days of receiving the result, to ask for a re-test. If the re-test still doesn’t meet the requirements, you will be issued with a ‘compliance notice’. If a sensory re-test fails, you will have to pay for it. What happens if the inspector finds a problem? If RPA inspectors find that you have not complied with the regulations, they’ll let you know using a ‘compliance notice’. This will tell you what’s wrong, what you must do and the deadline. If you don’t comply with the ‘compliance notice’ you may be prosecuted. How to complain about an RPA inspection or decision If you don’t agree with a ‘compliance notice’, you can write to RPA and ask them to review it. If you’re still not happy after the review, you can appeal: in England and Wales, to the General Regulatory Chamber of the First-tier Tribunal in Scotland, to the relevant sheriff in Northern Ireland, to the relevant magistrates’ court They must receive your appeal within 28 days of the date on the ‘compliance notice’. Or, in Scotland or Northern Ireland, within the period given in the notice, if that is shorter. If you’re not happy about the service you’ve received, you can complain to RPA .

/guidance/exporting-common-agricultural-policy-goods,"How to export food and agriculture products covered by CAP: export licences, duty, export quotas and relief from CAP charges. Exporting Common Agricultural Policy goods International freight industry and businesses making customs declarations Rural Payments Agency HM Revenue & Customs Introduction The Common Agricultural Policy ( CAP ) uses a system of refunds and levies to maintain pricing levels and availability. If you want to export or import licensable goods or claim refunds you must be registered with the Rural Payments Agency ( RPA ), which manages the CAP schemes. This guide shows you whether you require a licence to export your goods, how to obtain one and how to manage the export process, including claiming refunds and paying levies. If you are moving goods to or from the UK then you need to Classify imports and exports using the UK Integrated Tariff . Common Agricultural Policy export licences There’s a wide variety of goods covered by specific CAP schemes. Each has its own specific requirements for licensing and management of refunds and levies. You should check what the export licence requirements are with the RPA before exporting any of the following products: dairy products live animals fresh or processed meat (including edible offal) sugar, syrup, molasses and honey cereals and rice (including milled products, starch, gluten and insulin) eggs animal fodder, residues and waste from food industries fresh or processed fruit and vegetables live plants and trees and cut flowers coffee, tea and spices cocoa beans and shells oils and fats fish, crustaceans and molluscs (fresh or processed) fermented drinks tobacco cork flax and hemp processed goods, eg products such as biscuits which have one or more of the goods listed above as a basic ingredient You can also  find a guide to licence requirements . Processed goods and the recipe system If you are exporting processed goods you may apply to the RPA for a recipe code. This will allow you to claim a refund more simply by calculating the percentage of each eligible ingredient used in the processed goods as opposed to claiming each separate ingredient. You can  find the trader’s guide to exporting processed goods - leaflet ET17 . You can apply for a recipe code using an ET/PG1 form. To find out about the requirements for the various CAP schemes and to see the full listing of schemes (organised by product type) operated by the RPA , read the trader’s guide to importing and exporting CAP goods - leaflet ET1 . Getting the right licence If you’re exporting goods that require a licence or intend to claim export refunds, you must register with the RPA . To register with RPA and receive your trader registration number, call the Rural Payments helpline on 03000 200 301. UK licences are issued by the RPA and lodged with HMRC  through their Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight ( CHIEF ) computer system. For exports, the following three types of licences apply. Advance Fixing Certificates/World Trade Organization ( WTO ) licences If you wish to claim an export refund on your goods, you may need an export licence with advance fixing of the refund, known as an Advanced Fixing Certificate or a WTO licence. For processed goods an export refund can be claimed from the small exporters reserve or you can apply for a refund certificate and have the option to advance fix the refund rates. There are significant benefits to obtaining a licence with advance fixing. The licence confirms the rate of refund you can claim and helps you plan your cash-flow. For more information you can read the trader’s guide to importing and exporting CAP goods leaflet ET1. Mandatory export licences for certain goods If you’re exporting sugar, cereals or rice, you may require an export licence to do so. This requirement is determined by the product type, weight and destination. Tender licences If you have tendered to supply CAP goods to public authorities outside the EU , you should apply for a tender licence in advance. This will speed up the process if you win the tender. Checking licences through CHIEF While licences are issued electronically through CHIEF , in some circumstances you may require a paper licence, eg for use in other EU member states. You should make this clear on the licence application form. If an electronic licence has already been issued, the RPA will issue a paper licence provided there’s sufficient remaining unused quantity on the licence. Lodging security to support your licence You may have to provide financial security to the RPA - usually a bank guarantee - in order to support your licence and this may have implications for your cash-flow. You can find out how the CAP works . Applying for a Common Agricultural Policy export licence There are three ways to submit your licence application - by post, fax or email. If you intend to submit your application by post, you must address it to the relevant commodity department at the RPA . You should check with the RPA which department is most appropriate. You can call the RPA External Trade Helpline on Telephone: 03300 416 500. If you apply by fax or email and it arrives before noon, the licence will be lodged the same day. To apply for licences by email, you must be pre-approved by the RPA and lodge registered email addresses with them. All faxed applications must be signed. You can download an Export license application form . Security You’ll usually need to lodge security to ensure you comply with the CAP scheme you’re exporting under. The values required are defined by the specific CAP scheme and can vary. For example, you may be required to lodge a security to the value of your goods plus a set percentage depending on the commodity. These securities must be in place before you can export your goods. There are 3 key types of security: block guarantee - Similar to a bank account - guarantees are deposited before the shipment takes place and refunded when all the criteria are met. These transactions continue on a rolling basis. You can use an approved guarantor or run the account yourself. This is usually the best system to use if you export frequently. single transaction guarantees - An approved guarantor provides payment to guarantee your responsibilities on a transaction-by-transaction basis. cash and cheque securities - You can provide the RPA with security in the form of a banker’s draft, bank transfer, building society cheque or cash which will be returned when the transaction is satisfactorily completed. The RPA provides a customer guide that explains the various processes in greater detail. You can download a customer’s guide to securities and guarantees from the RPA website (PDF, 1.02MB). Note that if you fail to fulfil an obligation, you risk forfeiting the appropriate amount of security and an invoice specifying the forfeited amount will be sent to you. Refunds under the Common Agricultural Policy Under the CAP , the supply and pricing of specific goods is ensured and kept competitive by a system of refunds and levies in the EU . Refunds are provided when the market price of your exported goods is lower in your target market than in the EU . This ensures your product is priced competitively in your export market while you still obtain a fair price for the goods. In most cases, you’ll be dealing with refunds, as prices are generally lower in non- EU countries. What you need to prove to obtain a refund To obtain a refund, you must prove that the goods: tally with the details provided on the export refund application form were exported within the prescribed time limits are of sound, marketable quality are in free circulation have not altered while in Customs control are of EU origin However, there are instances where other regulations could override the right to receive a CAP export refund. When transporting live bovine animals to third countries, for example, respect of the animal welfare rules is a condition for any refund claimed. See this guide on  Live transport: welfare regulations . How to claim refunds How you receive your refund will depend on whether it’s ‘undifferentiated’ or ‘differentiated’. Undifferentiated refunds are processed when the goods leave the EU . These are applicable when the CAP scheme has a flat refund rate, regardless of the non- EU country to which the goods have been exported. Differentiated refunds are applicable where the refund amount is dependent upon the destination of the goods. Undifferentiated refunds are payable when the goods satisfy Customs’ checks on the information provided by your licence or claim for a refund. For differentiated refunds you’ll have to provide proof of export and depending upon the refund value proof of import into the non- EU country to the RPA for the refund to be paid. You can find out about the requirements for the various CAP schemes and see the full listing of schemes (organised by product type) . If you use a World Trade Organisation licence with advanced fixing, the value of your refund is determined when you take out the advance fixing certificate, making it easier to plan your cash-flow. You’ll usually have to lodge a security, the amount of which is defined by the type of goods you’re exporting. You must keep to time limits to ensure you receive the full level of refunds due. Goods must leave the EU within 60 days of an export declaration being accepted and papers must be received within 12 months. If you fail to meet these deadlines, the amount of refund could be reduced. In addition, to make sure all of your licence security is returned, you must return the used licence to the RPA within two months of its expiry. If you return your licence between two and 24 months after expiry, the RPA will only release 85% of the security. An additional 28-day deadline applies if your goods leave the UK and enter another EU port to change their method of transport - a process referred to as transhipment. Goods being transhipped must usually leave the port within the original 60-day period and within 28 days of the re-arrival to qualify for full refund. You can also receive advance payment of refunds once goods have been put into Customs control. In order to do this, you must make a 110% deposit security on the refund you’re claiming. The security will be released when proof of export is received. To find out more about refunds and levies, see pages 33 to 46 of leaflet ET1. You can use the trader’s guide to importing and exporting CAP goods leaflet ET1 . Levies under the Common Agricultural Policy Under the CAP , if your goods are in short supply in the EU or their price outside the EU exceeds EU levels, exporting will be restricted by raising a levy on the goods. Levies will only apply to consignments from the EU . You don’t have to pay a levy if: the goods aren’t of EU origin and aren’t in free circulation an export refund has been fixed in advance If levies are raised on your goods they become due at the time of export. However, you may be able to defer payment of levies if you have securities in place that cover the value of the levies, go to section 2.4 of Notice 800 .  If you wish to re-enter goods to Customs control when an export levy applies to another part of the EU , you must submit form T5 to HMRC and lodge a security. The security will be released once proof of the goods re-entering the EU is supplied to HMRC . To find out more about export levies, read the trader’s guide to importing and exporting CAP goods - leaflet ET1 and go to the section on ‘Export refunds and levies’. CAP export procedures - standard procedure All export declarations go through the CHIEF computer system. Most exports of CAP goods also go through the standard procedures for Customs clearance. It’s best to make your declaration electronically through CHIEF as manual declarations will first have to be processed by the Customs National Clearance Hub. When you’re making the entry, you’ll also have to enter details of any refund claim you’re going to make. Once you have made the entry correctly, the refund process will be started. To start the refund claim, you must supply: the RPA claim reference and type your RPA reference and guarantee numbers your RPA licence details You must also supply specific paperwork or details of electronic documentation, dependent upon the destination of the goods. In all cases, you’ll need to supply details of your CAP export licence. Read more about the documentation required for export and claim refunds for CAP goods in section 4.2 of Notice 800 . You must make the entry into CHIEF in sufficient time to allow the goods to be checked by Customs. Once you have made the entry in the form of a Goods Arrival Message, you must wait to receive a Permission to Progress (P2P) message before your goods can be loaded. When the goods have left the port, the loader must submit a Goods Departure Message to CHIEF . Alternatively, you can use C88 ( CAP ) CIE procedures. This means you present the C88 ( CAP ) CIE form at the port with your goods. If the goods can be examined and the required paperwork is present, Customs will input the data onto CHIEF and forward details to the RPA . When completing a C88 ( CAP ) CIE, you must: list the type and quantity of goods you’re exporting provide details about their destination only list a maximum of 99 export items per form You’ll also need a form T5 for goods exported via another EU member state and all relevant licences and advanced fixing certificates. Late submission of documents If you fail to provide all the relevant details when using the electronic system or fail to present a C88 ( CAP ) CIE to HMRC , you won’t receive any refunds. To find out more about export procedures for CAP goods, read the trader’s guide to importing and exporting CAP goods - leaflet ET1 and go to page G1. Undeclared exports If you don’t submit your goods or any Customs forms to Customs before you try to export them, HMRC will give them ‘undeclared export’ status. You won’t be able to get a refund, even if HMRC accept a late declaration. Using Local Clearance Procedure You can also apply to use the Local Clearance Procedure. This means that Customs inspections can be carried out at inland premises approved by HMRC before export which can save you time and money. Inspections and sampling at the inland premises will still require you to open, unpack, weigh and repack any goods as requested by HMRC , as well as providing any requested paperwork. Go to the guide on Customs Freight Simplified Procedures . You can also use Designated Export Places but cannot use simplified procedures on goods where an export refund is being claimed. Simplified scheduling procedure and the Common Agricultural Policy There’s a simplified scheduling procedure you can use when exporting CAP goods which can minimise your paperwork by summarising several consignments. You can only use the simplified scheduling procedure if you’re: approved by HMRC and the RPA to use it an exporting victualling supplier for ships and aircraft in the EU supplying international organisations in the UK which are allowed to receive duty free goods supplying armed forces within the EU who aren’t in their home country providing catering supplies for oil or gas rigs on the EU shelf or naval vessels at sea flying a member state’s flag receiving regular, scheduled consignments of less than 5,000 kilograms of cereal or 500 kilograms of other goods per month You can use the simplified procedure to summarise several consignments. Each claim must be for: one type of good, with the same product code one calendar month’s consignments Claiming a refund for scheduled goods You can use your own records to claim a refund. You should do this at regular intervals which you have agreed with Customs. You should: copy details from your Export Control Register ( ECR ) onto schedule forms C1226A and C1227A send the schedules to HMRC to check Customs will send the forms to the RPA after they have checked them. Completing your ECR These are the basic rules for keeping an ECR . You should record: a sequential number and date for each entry the commercial description of the goods commodity product codes net weight of the goods for packaged goods - the number of packages and a packing list - unless the packages are all the same the number of any CAP export licence or advance fixing certificate the number of any Special Export Refund form where the goods will be exported and the name of the importer the date you’ll be exporting the goods cross-references to any other documents such as T5, C1226A, transit form so they can be checked against each other where the goods will leave the UK any port of transhipment Date of acceptance Customs will advise you about the timings of making entries into your ECR . The date you make entries in the ECR counts as the date of acceptance. For scheduling, Customs use the date of acceptance to work out: your refunds any time limits that apply to your goods You use different paperwork and manage your own records for claiming refunds if you use this system. To find out about simplified scheduling,  read the trader’s guide to importing and exporting CAP goods - leaflet ET1 Exports via the EU and the Common Agricultural Policy If you’re exporting CAP goods via another EU member state before they leave the EU , you must follow a specific procedure. Goods must remain under Customs control until they leave the EU . If the goods are going to or through a European Free Trade Association country, you must use Community Transit forms and  form T5. The control copy of form T5 must travel with the goods. In most cases, the Community Transit form you use comprises copies of the C88 (SAD). You’ll need to supply Customs with a C88 ( CAP ) CIE or use the CHIEF  computer system to lodge an entry. You should attach a red label to the T5 form to ensure it’s easily identified. When the goods leave the EU , Customs in the final EU country will stamp the T5 form and return it to the RPA via HMRC to enable the processing of any refund. You must make an export declaration if you export CAP goods to an ‘entitled destination’. ‘Entitled destinations’ must meet certain criteria but in general are: armed forces not based in their own country naval and auxiliary ships oil and gas rigs ships and aircraft victualling warehouses international organisations If you are exporting to entitled destinations, you will also need to complete the following forms which you can find on the HMRC website: C1226A - CAP export refund consignment schedule C1227A - CAP export declaration and claim form for export refund and advance payment For more information on exporting CAP goods via another EU member state, read the trader’s guide to importing and exporting CAP goods - leaflet ET1 and see page H1.
