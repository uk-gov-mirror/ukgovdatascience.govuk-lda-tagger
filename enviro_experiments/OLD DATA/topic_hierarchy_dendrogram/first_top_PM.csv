/guidance/animal-by-product-processors-how-to-carry-out-a-processing-test,"Find out how to carry out a processing test, which is part of validation for continuous animal by-product processing facilities.  Animal by-product processors: how to carry out a processing test  Animal and Plant Health Agency Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs All animal by-product ( ABP ) processing facilities must be validated by the Animal and Plant Health Agency ( APHA ) before they can operate. Find out how to get your ABP processor validated . If you operate a continuous processor, you will need to carry out a processing test as part of validation. A continuous processor is one where you continuously feed material into the cooker (the machine where material is heat-treated), instead of processing material in separate batches. The test involves sending an insoluble marker (generally manganese dioxide) through the cooker to check that you are meeting the time and temperature requirements of your processing method. Contact APHA ’s laboratory in Newcastle, which is the only laboratory in the UK able to test validation samples: APHA Newcastle Whitley Road Longbenton Newcastle upon Tyne NE12 9SE Telephone 0300 303 8269 The laboratory will send you manganese oxide briquettes and explain how you need to feed them into your cooker. You will also need to agree when you will carry out the test, so the laboratory is prepared to receive samples. APHA will send a veterinary officer to observe your test. How to carry out the test To make sure the test accurately reflects how long material stays in the cooker: add the marker to the material that is being processed as close as possible to the entrance to the cooker take samples of greaves (material exiting the cooker) as soon as possible after material exits the cooker If, for safety or practical reasons, you have to add the material or take greaves samples at a point that is more than 1 minute before material enters or exits the cooker, factor this into your timings. The test will last for 3 hours after you add the marker to the processor, unless the APHA veterinary officer has agreed you can end the test earlier (this will only happen if you use a processing method that doesn’t require material to stay in the cooker for a long period of time). How to take samples during the test You need to take 500g samples of the greaves exiting the cooker as follows: take the first sample 30 minutes before you add the marker to the cooker then take a sample every 6 minutes until 3 hours after you added the marker to the cooker You should have a total of 40 samples. Take the samples with a stainless steel sampling scoop, and wipe the scoop with paper cloths between each sample to ensure none of the marker is carried over between samples. If you believe you see a fragment of the briquettes of the marker in the greaves, you should try and include it in a sample. If the fragment appears in the greaves between sampling times, you should take an additional sample, and note the time it was taken. You don’t need to do this more than twice if you spot several fragments of the marker. Where and how to send samples for testing Place the samples in pots, and label each pot to indicate when the sample was taken. The first sample you took, 30 minutes before you added the marker to the cooker, should be labelled -30. The next sample should be labelled -24, the next -18 and so on until the final sample that you took (3 hours or 180 minutes after the marker was added), which should be labelled ‘180’. Secure a lid to each pot with white PVC tape and seal each pot in a polythene bag. Send the pots to the to the APHA laboratory in Newcastle in a box marked with the words ‘RENDERING VALIDATION ASHING’. Include a completed laboratory submission form (which the laboratory will provide). Information you need to record during the test You also need to record the following data during the test (starting 30 minutes before you add the marker to the cooker, and ending 3 hours after you added it): the temperature at every point in the cooker where you have a thermocouple - take a measurement every 12 minutes the size of particle exiting the cooker - take a measurement every 30 minutes the rate at which you are feeding raw material into the cooker - take a measurement every 12 minutes the level of fat in the cooker or the fat recycling rate if you add fat to your cooker - take a measurement every 18 minutes How to calculate if you met the time requirements for your processing method The laboratory results will tell you the concentration of the marker in each of the samples that you sent for testing. Plot the marker concentration over time, starting at -30 minutes (the first sample) and ending at 180 (the last sample) and draw a trendline between all the points. Calculate a ‘background level’ of concentration of the marker. This is the average concentration level in the first 5 samples you took (samples ‘-30’ to ‘-6’ that were taken before you added the marker to the cooker). Draw a straight line across the graph, at a level that is 50% higher than the background level. The point where your trendline of marker concentration crosses consistently above this straight line is the point when the marker is considered to have exited the cooker. If your trendline spikes above the straight line for 1 sample, but then falls back below, disregard that sample. Note the time the trendline crosses above the straight line. This is the time taken for material to pass through your cooker. It must be higher than the minimum time required for your processing method, or you won’t pass the test. You need to supply this graph and your workings to APHA . How to calculate if you met the temperature requirements for your processing method Now go back to the temperature measurements you took every 12 minutes from your thermocouples during the test. For each 12 minute data point, chose either: the average of all of the temperatures you recorded at your thermocouples at that time the lowest temperature you recorded at any individual thermocouple at that time The average temperature will give you a higher temperature reading, making it more likely that you pass the validation test. But if APHA approve your facility, you will be set a minimum temperature to maintain at the exit point of your cooker. This temperature will be higher if you used average temperatures in your validation test. Plot the average or minimum temperature at every point that you recorded it between time 0 (when the marker was put into the processor) until the time you noted in the previous section (when the marker exited the cooker). Draw a temperature trendline on the graph. Now draw straight lines across your graph at each of the temperatures specified in your processing method. For example, approved method 2 requires material to be processed at: 120°C for 13 minutes 110°C for 55 minutes 100°C for 95 minutes You need to draw straight lines at 120°C, 110°C and 100°C. Note the time the temperature trendline moves above each of those lines, and when it moves back below them. For each of the specified temperatures, calculate the maximum time the trendline is above the specified temperature. This is the time between when the trendline climbs above the temperature and when it next drops below the temperature. For each of the specified temperatures it must be longer than the minimum required time or you won’t pass the test. You need to supply this graph and your workings to APHA as part of the validation process."
/guidance/laboratory-testing-requirements-for-animal-by-products-abps,"Find out how to take samples from processed ABPs and find laboratories to test them, and what to do if one of your samples fails a test. Laboratory testing requirements for animal by-products (ABPs)  Animal and Plant Health Agency Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs If you process animal by-products ( ABPs ), such as animal carcasses or kitchen waste, you may need to test samples of your products to check they are safe to use. You need to submit samples for testing if you operate: an ABP processing facility (often known as a rendering plant) a composting or anaerobic digestate facility a petfood factory a fertiliser factory (if you use ABPs in your fertiliser) a biodiesel plant (if you use ABPs to make your biodiesel) a blood processor a milk processor What bacteria you need to test for and when to take samples The testing requirements for different types of processing facility are summarised in the following table:   Salmonella Enterobacteriaceae Clostridium perfingens Escherichia coli (E.coli) or Enterococcaceae Biogas, compost or manure processing facility Yes     Yes Facilities applying for approval for a new (method 7) processing method Yes Yes Yes   Any other ABP processing facility (rendering plants, pet food and fertiliser factories, blood processors, biodiesel plants, milk processors) Yes Yes     The Animal and Plant Health Agency ( APHA ) may ask you to carry out additional tests as one of your operating conditions. For all bacteria except Salmonella, you should take samples immediately after you finish processing your ABP material. Salmonella tests are used to check that your products are not re-contaminated in storage after processing. APHA will discuss when you should take samples for Salmonella testing, when they approve your plant. How to take samples First sterilise and clean any equipment that you will need to use, such as scoops or dippers. You can chose any sterilisation technique or follow this method: Wash with detergent. Rinse with water. Boil in a fish kettle for 30 minutes. Making sure samples are representative To make sure samples are representative: 1) Mix the material thoroughly before you collect samples. 2) Use this table to find out how many sub-samples you need to collect and what size each sub-sample should be. Volume of material to be sampled Number of sub-samples Minimum sub-sample volume (for liquid material) Minimum sub-sample weight (for solid material) Up to 1,000 cubic metres 12 0.33 litres 330 grams 1,000 to 1,999 cubic metres 16 0.25 litres 250 grams 2,000 to 3,600 cubic metres 22 0.18 litres 180 grams Over 3,600 cubic metres 30 0.13 litres 130 grams 3) Collect the correct number of sub-samples from different parts of the mixture and mix them together thoroughly in a clean polythene bag or container. 4) Take a single final sample of 0.5 litres (for liquid material) or 500 grams (for solid material) from the bag or container. 5) Place the final sample in a clean container suitable for transport to the laboratory. Representative sampling isn’t possible for some solid products such as dog chews, which can’t be easily mixed together. In this case select a sample at random from among the products instead. The sample should be at least 500g. Taking and storing a backup B sample The sample that you send to the laboratory for testing is known as the A sample. When you take the A sample, you must take a second B sample in exactly the same way. Seal the B sample in a container and place it in a fridge that is not used for storing food. You will need to send the B sample to the laboratory if the laboratory can’t test your A sample for any reason (eg if it is lost or damaged). If your A sample fails the test (the laboratory results show it contains too high a level of the bacteria it was tested for) you can’t send your B sample in place of the A sample. You must tell APHA you failed the test. You can destroy your B sample if your A sample passes the test (laboratory results show it contained an acceptable level of bacteria). How to find a laboratory to carry out tests You must send your samples to a laboratory accredited by the United Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS). You can search the UKAS website for a laboratory accredited to carry out a specific test , or a group of tests . Laboratories are accredited on a test-by-test basis so you may have to send samples to more than one laboratory if you need to test for more than one type of bacteria. You can also look for a laboratory on the Defra list of laboratories approved for ABP testing . All laboratories on the Defra list are UKAS accredited, but you may find the Defra list easier to search. How to interpret laboratory results The laboratory will divide your sample into 5 sub-samples. The laboratory will give a result for each sub-sample using the notation: bacteria name, x per y grams Where bacteria name is the name of the bacteria tested for (eg Salmonella), and x is the number of colonies of that bacteria counted in y grams of the sub-sample. Instead of giving a number the laboratory may also report the result for a sub-sample as: ‘non-detected’ ‘<10cfu/g’ This means the laboratory wasn’t able to detect any bacterial colonies in that sub-sample. How much bacteria your samples can contain Salmonella Your sample will fail if any sub-sample contains any Salmonella colonies Enterobacteriaceae A sample of raw pet food will fail if: any of the sub-samples contains more than 5,000 Enterobacteriaceae colonies per gram 3 or more sub-samples contain more than 10 Enterobacteriaceae colonies per gram A sample of any other ABP product (including processed pet food) will fail if: any of the sub-samples contains more than 300 Enterobacteriaceae colonies per gram 3 or more sub-samples contain more than 10 Enterobacteriaceae colonies per gram Clostridium perfingens Your sample will fail if any sub-sample contains any Clostridium perfingens colonies Escherichia coli (E.coli) Your sample will fail if: any of the sub-samples contains more than 5,000 E.coli colonies per gram 2 or more sub-samples contain more than 1,000 E.coli colonies per gram Enterococcaceae No UK laboratory is currently accredited to test for Enterococcaceae, so most compost and biogas facilities test for E.coli instead. But you can send your samples to a laboratory in another EU state that is accredited to test for Enterococcaceae. Your sample will fail if: any of the sub-samples contains more than 5,000 Enterococcaceae colonies per gram 2 or more sub-samples contain more than 1,000 Enterococcaceae colonies per gram What to do if your sample fails a test If one of your samples fails a test you must tell your nearest APHA office immediately. You will need to investigate what caused the failed test and explain to APHA how you plan to fix the problem. APHA will need to agree that your solution addresses the problem. You will have to record any failed test, and the actions taken as a result. How long to keep test records You must keep test results for at least 2 years in written or electronic form, and present them to APHA officers if you are asked."

Processing manure for sale as fertiliser in the EU  Animal and Plant Health Agency Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs If you want to sell manure, guano or digestive tract content as fertiliser in the EU , they must first be treated at an approved processing plant. To get approval to process manure, guano or digestive tract content contact your nearest Animal and Plant Health Agency ( APHA ) field office . How to process manure, guano and digestive tract content for sale as fertiliser in the EU Manure, guano and digestive tract content must be heated to 70°C for at least 60 minutes before they can be sold in the EU as fertiliser. You can use an alternative method if you can show the APHA that your method is effective at making the product safe to use. Contact your nearest APHA office if you want to discuss the validation of an alternative treatment method. Documents required for validation of an alternative processing method You will need to write a Standard Operating Procedure ( SOP ) and Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points plan ( HACCP ) to explain how you will: control and record temperature processing conditions (eg temperature, presence of chemical agents, time spent in the cooker) during your treatment manage hazards including the content of unprocessed raw material You can combine your SOP and HACCP into a single document, and it is up to how you present them to APHA . Processing test for validation of an alternative processing method You will also need to carry out a test to show that your treatment is effective at controlling levels of bacteria, viruses and other parasites. If you use a heat treatment, you will need to show your process controls: the presence of bacteria like Enterococcus faecalis infectivity titres of viruses like Parvovirus If your treatment involves chemicals, you will also need to show that it controls the presence of eggs of parasites like the Ascaris parasite. Before your validation test, add indicators to your raw material that have a similar heat and chemical resistance to the organisms you need to control. If you use a heat treatment, your process will need to reduce the presence of the indicator of: Enteroccus faecalis by 5 log 10 parvovirus by 3 log 10 If your treatment involves chemicals, your process will also need to reduce the presence of the indicator of eggs of the Ascaris parasite by 3 log 10. How to test processed manure, guano or digestive tract content for bacteria You must take samples from each batch of your processed product to check if your treatment is effectively controlling bacteria levels. You need to send samples to a laboratory for tests for Salmonella and either E.coli or Enterococcaceae. Take the samples for E.coli or Enterococcaceae testing immediately after you have finished treating the manure, guano or digestive tract content. Take the samples for Salmonella testing when you remove your product from storage to send it away from your facility. Find out more about laboratory testing requirements for animal by-product ( ABP ) material , including how to take samples and where to send them for testing. How to store processed manure, guano or digestive tract content To prevent contamination of your processed product, you must store it in either of the following: well-sealed and insulated silos or storage sheds sealed packs, such as plastic bags or ‘big bags’ How to send processed manure, guano or digestive tract content to another EU state Contact the APHA Specialist Service Centre in Carlisle if you would like to send your processed product to another EU state.

/government/news/first-finding-of-disease-caused-by-avian-reovirus-in-a-wild-bird-in-gb,"GB Wildlife Disease Surveillance Partnership confirms the first finding of disease in a wild bird caused by avian reovirus. First finding of disease caused by avian reovirus in a wild bird in GB  Animal and Plant Health Agency Working as part of the Defra-funded GB Wildlife Disease Surveillance Partnership, vets and scientists from the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) and Zoological Society of London (ZSL) have discovered the first finding of avian reovirus (ARV)-associated disease in a wild bird in Great Britain. Following the death of a magpie in a garden in Buckinghamshire, post-mortem examination and detailed laboratory testing confirmed the presence of ARV, which had caused severe necrosis of the liver and spleen, and was identified as the cause of death of the bird. Two further magpies were observed with similar illness at different times at the same site. These birds were presumed to have died, but their carcasses could not be recovered for further investigation. Richard Irvine, Head of Scanning Surveillance at APHA, commented: “Avian reoviruses can cause a range of disease presentations in poultry, captive and wild bird species, and until now ARV has not been reported as a disease of magpies or other wild birds in Great Britain. “Continued veterinary surveillance activities, performed in partnership, help us to identify changes in the patterns of livestock and wildlife health, including novel disease presentations such as this. “By raising awareness of this finding any threats posed to other wild birds or poultry can also be managed.” Becki Lawson, Research Veterinarian at ZSL’s Institute of Zoology added: “ARV causes disease and mortality in wild corvid (crow family) species in North America and continental Europe. Due to the vigilance of the British public, this is the first identified case in the UK. “We would like to appeal for any dead or sick garden wildlife (amphibians, reptiles, hedgehogs or garden birds) to be reported to us via www.gardenwildlifehealth.org.” The full paper is available on the BMC Veterinary Research website The GB Wildlife Disease Surveillance Partnership (GBWDSP) brings together organisations that are involved in wildlife disease surveillance to monitor trends in wildlife diseases.

/guidance/how-to-operate-an-animal-by-product-abp-processing-facility,"Find out what methods you can use to process ABPs, how to test your products for bacteria and how to permanently mark high risk material. How to operate an animal by-product (ABP) processing facility  Animal and Plant Health Agency Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Before opening an animal by-product facility, you need to get Animal and Plant Health Agency ( APHA ) approval to operate . You will also need to meet standards that apply across the ABP industry in areas such as hygiene and record keeping. How to crush material before you process it Before you process any ABP material you must crush it into small pieces of between 20 and 150 millimetres ( mm ) in width and height (the exact size limit is different for each of the approved methods). There’s no limit to the length of the piece. You can use any machinery to crush the material, eg mincers, cutters or breakers. Set up the machinery to ensure that material larger than the maximum size allowed for your processing method can’t pass through. Do this by measuring the size of the holes in a mincer, or the anvil gap in a cutter, for example. You’ll need to make the gaps smaller if they’re larger than the maximum size of material allowed for your treatment. You must inspect some of your crushed material every day before you process it. If the pieces are larger than the size required for the method you plan to use, stop processing material until you have repaired your equipment. Approved processing methods There are 6 approved methods you can use to process ABPs . Use the table to find out the time and temperature combinations required in each of the methods. Category 1 and 2 ABP material must be pressure sterilised (method 1 in the table). You can process category 3 material using any of the methods in the table. Find out what category your ABP material falls into . Name Maximum size of material to be treated Core temperature Time at core temperature Special details Method 1 (pressure sterilisation) 50 mm 133°C for 20 minutes without interruption Maintain minimum pressure of 3 bars (2 bars above normal atmospheric pressure), by removing all air from the sterilisation chamber and replacing with steam Method 2 150mm 120°C for 50 minutes Process material in batches, one after another. Don’t feed more material into the cooker while one batch is processing.     and 110°C for 120 minutes       and 100°C for 125 minutes   Method 3 30mm 120°C for 13 minutes       and 110°C for 55 minutes       and 100°C for 95 minutes   Method 4 30mm 130°C for 3 minutes Add fat before heating     and 120°C for 8 minutes       and 110°C for 13 minutes       and 100°C for 16 minutes   Method 5 20mm 100°C for 60 minutes Before processing heat until ABPs coagulate (begin to solidify). Then press so that fat and water are removed. Treat the leftover solid material.     and 80°C for 120 minutes   Method 6 (for aquatic ABPs ) 50mm 90°C for 60 minutes Mix with formic acid to pH 4.0 or lower and store for 24 hours before further treatment   or 30mm 70°C for 60 minutes   For methods where more than one time and temperature combination is required, time spent at the higher temperature also counts towards the lower temperature. For example in method 5, the 60 minutes spent at 100°C count towards the 120 minutes that must be spent at 80°C. For method 2 you need to process material in batches. For all the other methods you can continuously feed material into your cooker (the equipment where you process ABPs ). If you are feeding material continuously, you need to ensure each piece of material stays in the cooker for the time required by the treatment method. ‘Method 7’ processing You can use other methods to process ABPs if APHA grants permission. Find out how to propose a method 7 processing method to APHA . Testing samples for bacteria You must test samples of your processed material for bacteria, to check processing has removed risks to public and animal health. You must test processed material for Salmonella and Enterobacteriaceae. You may also have to test for other bacteria if APHA made that a condition when they approved your facility. You should take samples: daily from any material that is going to be used in animal feed weekly from material that is going to be used in any other products, for example in fertiliser or to make compost Find out more about laboratory testing requirements for ABPs including details of how and when to take samples and where to send them for testing. How to permanently mark dangerous material with GTH GTH (glyceroltriheptanoate) is an artificial fat that survives the extreme heat treatment used to process ABPs . You need to mark all category 1 and 2 ABP material with GTH so it can be traced. The only exception is material sent by a closed conveyer system for immediate direct incineration or co-incineration within your processing plant. Find out what ABP material falls into category 1 and 2 . In the standard operating procedure ( SOP ) document that you send to APHA when you validate your processing facility , you will need to explain how you plan to control the addition of GTH . Records you need to keep of GTH addition Once operating you will need to keep a daily record of: GTH added to the processing mixture ABPs processed processed material produced the ratio of GTH applied to ABPs processed Testing for GTH during normal operating To check that you have successfully marked high risk material with GTH , you need to send samples for testing: weekly during the first month of normal operating fortnightly during months 2 to 6 monthly after 6 months Keep records of the test results. If one of your samples fails a test If any of your samples contains less than 250 mg of GTH per kg of fat: stop processing materials tell APHA You must investigate the problem with your GTH marking system, come up with a solution to correct it and tell APHA about your solution. Once the problem has been fixed APHA will let you restart operations if your solution complies with the regulations, but you will need to: re-process any material from which failed samples were taken revert to the sampling procedure that applied at the start of normal operating (ie take weekly samples for the first month, fortnightly samples for the second month, and monthly samples from then on) You also need to keep a record of any corrective actions you take in response to a failed test."
/guidance/validate-your-animal-by-product-abp-processing-facility,"Find out how to validate your facility when you seek approval to open, including special requirements for continuous and blood processors. Validate your animal by-product (ABP) processing facility  Animal and Plant Health Agency Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs You need approval from the Animal and Plant Health Agency ( APHA ) to open an animal by-product ( ABP ) processing facility. Complete form ABPR7 to get approval to operate . Once you have applied for approval, you must validate the facility to show you can treat ABPs effectively. APHA officers will inspect your facility as part of the validation process. If you are successfully validated, you will be given a document setting out your operating conditions. Once your facility opens, you will need to follow the guide to how to operate an ABP processing facility . Documents you need to provide As part of the validation process you will need to send the following to APHA : a flow diagram which explains in detail how you process ABPs in your facility any graphs, data or calculations for tests that are described in this guide a Standard Operating Procedure ( SOP ) and Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points ( HACCP ) plan to explain how you control important conditions at your facility, such as temperature and pressure You can combine your SOP and HACCP in to a single document, and it is up to how you present them to APHA . Processing conditions you need to control Your SOP and HACCP document needs to explain how you control the size of material, temperature and, in some cases, the pressure level in your ‘cooker’ (the machine where you heat treat ABPs ). How to control material size You need to crush ABPs into small pieces of no more than 150 millimetres (mm) before you feed material into a cooker for processing. (The exact size depends on the treatment method you use). This is to make sure the material is ‘cooked’ all the way through. You can use any machinery to crush the material, for example mincers, cutters or breakers. You need to set up the machinery to make sure that material larger than the maximum size allowed for your processing method can’t pass through. You do this by measuring the size of the holes in a mincer, or the anvil gap in a cutter, for example. You will need to make the gaps smaller if they are larger than the maximum size of material allowed for your treatment. During validation you should record the size of the anvil gap, how frequently it is checked, and how it is repaired if the gap is found to be the wrong size. As well as monitoring the size of the anvil gap, you should manually measure the size of some of the material that has been through the crusher, to confirm it meets the size requirements for your treatment method. How to control temperature You need to install a permanent thermocouple (temperature measuring device) in your cooker to measure temperature when processing is taking place. During validation you will need to plot a graph of temperature against time for each treatment method that you plan to use. This is to check you are meeting the time and temperature requirements for each treatment](https://www.gov.uk/how-to-operate-an-animal-by-product-abp-processing-facility#approved-processing-methods). Once you are approved to open, you will need to continue recording temperature whenever processing is taking place. You will also have to pay a company to inspect your thermocouple once a year to make sure it is working correctly (you may need to provide a certificate of inspection if you are inspected by APHA ). How and when to control pressure If you are using a treatment method that requires a certain pressure level, you need to install a pressure gauge in your cooker to measure pressure during processing. During validation you will need to plot a graph of pressure against time for your pressure treatments. This is to check you are meeting the pressure requirements for pressure sterilisation . You will need to state in your records whether you are recording pressure above atmospheric pressure, or absolute pressure (which is one bar higher). Once you are approved to open you will need to continue recording pressure whenever a pressure treatment is taking place. You will also need a company to inspect your pressure gauge once a year to make sure it is working correctly (you may need to provide a certificate of inspection if you are inspected by APHA ). Additional requirements for continuous processors If you are using a system where you continuously feed ABP material into your cooker (rather than processing material in batches) you will need to carry out a processing test as part of the validation process. Read the guide to carrying out a processing test . Your SOP and HACCP document will also need to explain how you control the following: the rate of flow of ABP material into your processor the rate of flow of fat into your cooker (if you add fat) additional temperature controls that apply How to control material flow rate You need to measure the rate at which ABP material flows into your cooker. It’s up to you how you control the material flow rate, but you must measure flow into the cooker at all times. You can’t simply calculate an average flow rate because the flow rate may change over time if it is not regulated. Your validation documents need to state what method you’re using (for example the revolutions per minute of the screw feeding material into your cooker.) How to control fat flow rate If you continuously add additional fat into your processing mixture, you need to also monitor one of the following: the flow rate of additional fat into the cooker the amount of fat in the cooker at any given time It’s up to you how you control the fat flow rate, but your validation documents need to state what method you are using (for example using a flow meter to measure the rate at which fat flows into your cooker). Additional temperature controls You need to install at least 3 thermocouples in your cooker to record temperature at different points in the cooking process. 1 thermocouple should be at (or as close as possible to) the entrance to the cooker and 1 should be at (or as close as possible to) the exit. The others should be evenly spaced within your cooker. So, for example, if you have 3 thermocouples place them at the start, half way point and exit of the cooker. If you have 4 thermocouples, place them at the start and exit, and at a third and two thirds of the way through the cooker. As part of validation you will need to plot graphs of temperature against time during the cooking process for each of your thermocouples, to show that you are meeting the time and temperature requirements for any processing method that you plan to use. (You will need to include pressure on these graphs if you plan to use a pressure treatment method). You can use an infrared temperature gun to measure temperature at different points, instead of installing many thermocouples. Additional requirements for blood processors If you are seeking approval for a blood processor, your SOP and HACCP document needs to show how you: ensure blood only moves through your facility in one direction keep track of unprocessed blood Ensure blood can only move in one direction through the facility You need to ensure blood can only move in one direction through your processing facility. Specifically you need to make sure: when untreated blood arrives at your facility it enters the storage tank, or tanks, for unprocessed blood through a one way inlet there is a single one way outlet pipe from each storage tank for unprocessed blood into the cooker there is a single one way outlet pipe from the cooker to the storage tank for processed blood there is a single one way outlet pipe from the storage tank for processed blood to vehicles that transport processed blood away from your facility The only exceptions to the single one way inlets and outlets are as follows: you need at least one additional outlet pipe from the cooker to drain it during an emergency (these additional outlets should be sealed shut during normal operating) you need to be able to access the cooker and the storage tank for processed blood to take product samples (you can read more about sampling requirements for ABP procesing facilities and how to take samples ) You need to provide APHA with a detailed route map for all the pipework in your facility during the approval process. You can’t alter the system once you are operating without APHA agreement. How to store untreated blood You need to store all untreated blood in a closed storage tank until it is processed. You need to have a system to automatically record: flow of blood into the storage tank volume of blood inside the tank at any given time flow of blood out of the tank You must reconcile these volumes everyday to make sure that you haven’t lost any unprocessed blood. Setting up a system to permanently mark high risk material with GTH To be validated you will need to to set up and successfully trial a system to mark high risk ABP material with GTH (glyceroltriheptanoate). GTH is an artificial fat that survives the extreme heat treatment used to process ABPs . Adding GTH to ABP material means the material can be traced. Testing for GTH You will need to agree a contract with a laboratory to test samples of your finished product for GTH . In the UK only 2 laboratories can carry out the test: the Laboratory of the Government Chemists the Agri-Food Biosciences Institute You can also send your samples to laboratories in other EU countries if they are accredited by their governments to carry out the test. Initial testing Add between 30 and 50 grams of GTH per tonne of ABP material at a point in your processing: where the ABP material being processed is at a temperature of least 80°C that is early enough in the process to ensure the GTH mixes thoroughly and all of the material is marked Once you have decided on your dosage carry out a test run for up to 5 days. After at least 24 hours of the test run, take a sample of processed material every 2 hours for 24 hours (giving you 12 samples in total). Send the samples to the laboratory you have contracted for testing. Each sample must have at least 250 milligrams of GTH per kg of fat. It is recommended, but not required, that on average the samples have at least 300mg of GTH per kg of fat. If your samples don’t meet these standards increase your GTH dosage. Keep running test periods and increasing your GTH dosage until your samples meet the standards. Trial period Once you have completed the test run, carry out a 5 day trial. Take 2 samples of processed material on each day of the trial (for a total of 10 samples) and send them for laboratory testing. Your samples need to meet the same standards as in the test period: each sample must have at least 250 milligrams of GTH per kg of fat it is recommended, but not required, that on average the samples have at least 300mg of GTH per kg of fat Increase the amount of GTH you apply and repeat trial periods until your samples meet these standards. Approval for changes to your processing method An APHA officer will consider your validation documents. If there are problems with the information provided, APHA will contact you. If you pass validation, you can apply for approval from APHA . You will need to repeat the approval process, including carrying out validation again, if you make significant changes to your processing method. Significant changes include: processing different raw materials changing machinery changing the flow rate If the changes are to restore your facility to a previous set up that APHA has already approved, this may not apply. But you must still contact APHA to discuss the situation."
/guidance/culling-during-a-disease-outbreak-animals-that-may-be-spared,"Find out which birds and animals may be spared from culling during an outbreak of an exotic animal disease.  Culling during a disease outbreak: animals that may be spared Reporting disease and disease outbreaks Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Animal and Plant Health Agency During an outbreak of an exotic notifiable animal disease government may need to cull (kill) animals to control disease spread. Certain categories of animal and bird may be spared from culling if this doesn’t interfere with efforts to control the disease. Decisions to spare are made on a case by case basis. A vet will carry out a risk assessment of the premises where the animal is kept. Other factors, including the potential implications of failing to cull, will also be considered. There are no guarantees an animal or bird will be spared. Animals that may be spared Government will consider sparing animals kept: in a zoo or a wildlife park for scientific research or breeding for such research in a premises approved for trade in semen, ova or embryos within the EU for display or educational purposes for purposes related to conservation of a species or genetic resource (see breeds at risk section of this guide) Poultry (kept birds) and other birds that may be spared Government will consider sparing poultry and other birds that are kept: in a non-commercial holding in a circus in a pet shop in a zoo or a wildlife park for scientific research or breeding for such research for purposes related to conservation of a species or genetic resource (see breeds at risk section of this guide) Breeds at risk that may be spared The Farm Animal Genetic Resources Committee ( FAnGR ) publishes the [InlineAttachment:1]. Breeds on this list are rare in the UK and government will consider sparing them during a cull to preserve their genetic resource. You should not confuse the UK breeds at risk list with the separate Native Breeds at Risk list of animals eligible for grants for grazing under the Rural Development Programme for England (RDPE). Registering UK breeds at risk If you own animals from the UK breeds at risk list and want government to consider sparing them, it is up to you to alert government. You can tell APHA officials about any at risk breeds when they visit your farm or premises during a disease outbreak. But ideally you should send a completed animal breeds at risk registration form to APHA . This information may help APHA respond to disease outbreaks. Proposing new UK breeds at risk The breeds at risk list is not closed. If you think there is a breed that should be added to the list, you can tell FAnGR , which is responsible for the list. You will need to explain how the breed meets the [InlineAttachment:2]. This guide on [InlineAttachment:3] may help you to make a case for your breed."
/guidance/chronic-wasting-disease,"How to spot chronic wasting disease (CWD), what to do if you suspect it and measures to prevent its spread. Chronic wasting disease: how to spot and report the disease  Animal and Plant Health Agency Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Chronic wasting disease ( CWD ) is a highly contagious and fatal transmissible spongiform encephalopathy ( TSE ) disease that affects deer. It has had devastating effects on many populations of wild and farmed deer in the USA and Canada. It is not known to affect humans. There is no evidence of TSEs in deer in the UK but if it were to become established in the wild deer population it would have major consequences for the UK deer industry. Chronic wasting disease is a notifiable disease. This means that if you suspect it you must tell the Animal and Plant Health Agency ( APHA ) immediately. Failure to do is an offence. How to spot CWD In most cases of CWD there is a general change in behaviour and loss of weight over time. Deer may show a number of different clinical signs. Changes in behaviour separation from other animals in the herd depression or blank facial expression lowering of the head difficulty in swallowing increased thirst and urination drooling pneumonia less interest in hay but continue to eat grain teeth grinding nervousness and excitement Changes in posture and movement stumbling and inco-ordination listless and dull repetitive walking in set patterns tremor paralysis Later signs weight loss The disease is fatal. Preventing CWD You can help prevent the disease by practising strict biosecurity on your premises. Feed controls It is illegal to feed animal protein to ruminants such as sheep, goats and deer. It is also illegal to feed processed animal protein to all farmed animals, although there are exceptions. See the guidance on TSE regulations and feed controls . Controlling CWD If you report suspicion of CWD , APHA vets will investigate. They may decide to keep your animal under observation to decide whether or not it is a TSE suspect. The vet will restrict the movement of the animal from the farm and will periodically visit the animal during the observation period. If the vet decides that your animal is a TSE suspect, the vet will restrict the movement of animal and issue a notice of intention to kill. After death, brain samples will be sent for post-mortem laboratory examination. If these tests confirm TSE , there will be further investigations of your herd and additional disease control measures may be put in place. You will be paid compensation for a deer which is compulsorily killed because it is suspected of being affected with a TSE . The amount paid is based on the market value of the animal at the time it was killed. See the guidance on compensation ."
/guidance/paramyxovirus-infection,"How to spot paramyxovirus infection in pigeons, what to do if you suspect it and measures to prevent its spread. Paramyxovirus infection: how to spot and report the disease  Animal and Plant Health Agency Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Pigeon paramyxovirus (PPMV) usually affects pigeons. It doesn’t normally affect humans. The disease is currently present in Great Britain. Pigeon paramyxovirus infection is a notifiable disease. That means if you suspect it you must tell the Animal and Plant Health Agency ( APHA ) immediately. Failure to do so is an offence. How to spot pigeon paramyxovirus infection Signs of paramyxovirus infection in pigeons may include: nervous sings, including trembling wings and heads, and twisting of the neck partial paralysis of wings and legs (birds may fall over on landing and be unable to feed) unusually wet and liquidy faeces (diarrhoea) that are often greenish in colour quietness, loss of appetite and reluctance to move The disease is very contagious so it is common for most of the pigeons sharing a loft to display clinical signs at the same time. How paramyxovirus is spread The disease is spread by direct contact between pigeons and through: pigeon transporters that have not been adequately cleaned and disinfected drinking water in lofts and transporters pigeon fanciers carrying infection on their clothes, hands and feet The disease can be introduced to a loft of kept pigeons through contact with wild pigeons. The disease can be spread to chickens if, for example, their feed is infected with the faeces of infected pigeons. In chickens paramyxovirus can cause Newcastle disease . Preventing and controlling paramyxovirus infection in pigeons You can help prevent the disease by: vaccinating your pigeons against the disease - talk to your vet for advice (if you run pigeons shows or races, you must ensure any bird taking part has been vaccinated) practising strict biosecurity on your premises If you organise a pigeon show or race you must make sure only vaccinated pigeons take part. If you own racing pigeons, you must keep a record of every show or race each bird takes part in. If you report suspicion of paramyxovirus infection in a pigeon APHA vets will investigate. If the disease is confirmed, APHA will impose temporary restrictions.

/guidance/rabies,"How to spot rabies, what to do if you suspect it and measures to prevent its spread. Rabies: how to spot and report the disease in animals  Animal and Plant Health Agency Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Rabies affects all mammals (warm blooded animals with backbones that produce milk and have fur or hair) including dogs and humans. Rabies was eradicated from all UK animals except bats in 1922. The last case in an imported animal outside of quarantine was in 1970. Rabies is a notifiable disease. That means if you suspect it you must tell the Animal and Plant Health Agency ( APHA ) immediately. Failure to do so is an offence. How to spot rabies Early clinical signs of rabies include: behaviour changes - friendly animals may become cautious, shy animals may become bold in dogs, a tendency to excessively seek attention and lick owners hypersensitivity to noise or light This can be followed by: increased aggression - dogs may try to break free and attack objects, animals and handlers eyes taking on a staring expression drooping lower jar and more saliva than normal produced itching thirst The final stages of rabies include: weak muscles, especially legs and tail difficulty swallowing drooping eyelids saliva frothing at the mouth general paralysis followed by convulsions and coma before death Some animals will show no signs at all, so laboratory tests are required to confirm rabies. If a mammal that you own is bitten or scratched by a bat, or another animal that may be rabid, consult a vet. How rabies is spread Rabies is present in the saliva of infected animals and is usually spread by the bite of an infected animal. Rabid saliva can also infect open wounds or mucous membranes such as the nostrils, mouth and lips, eyelids and ears. Rabies in bats Although rabies has been eradicated from the UK, a strain of the disease continues to be present in bats in this country. Bat rabies, or European bat lyssavirus is very rare among bats in the UK. But if you handle bats regularly you should be vaccinated as a precaution. If you have not been vaccinated against the disease: assume that all bats are possible carriers of bat rabies avoid touching bats, living or dead, whenever possible if you must touch a bat, wear thick gloves to avoid being bitten or scratched Risk to humans from rabies You may have been exposed to rabies, if you are bitten or scratched by: a bat in the UK any mammal in countries where rabies is present in other animals If there is a risk you have been exposed to the disease you should: wash your wound thoroughly with soap and water disinfect the wound immediately contact a doctor for treatment The disease is fatal for humans once signs of the disease appear. It can only be prevented if you are treated soon after exposure. Read the NHS guide to rabies for more information about the disease in humans. Preventing and controlling rabies Preventing rabies If you are bringing an animal into the UK you must follow these requirements for pet travel . If you suspect rabies Do not approach live animals that you think may be rabid. Do not touch dead animals that may have had the disease. Instead you must immediately tell your nearest APHA office , so the animal can be tested. If rabies is confirmed If rabies is confirmed the strategy for dealing with an outbreak of rabies will be implemented.

/guidance/anthrax-how-to-spot-and-report-the-disease,"How to spot anthrax, what to do if you suspect it and measures to prevent its spread. Anthrax: how to spot and report the disease  Animal and Plant Health Agency Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Anthrax affects mammals and some species of birds. These include: cattle pigs horses sheep humans Anthrax disease was confirmed in two dead suckler cows at a farm in Wiltshire in October 2015. Movement restrictions were imposed at the farm and carcases of the animals were incinerated. It would not be unusual for other cows in the herd to be affected so the death of the second animal was not unexpected. All the appropriate precautions are being taken and the rest of the herd continue to be monitored closely. The risk of infection in close human contact with these animals is very low and we continue to work with Public Health England to monitor potential human contacts. The previous outbreak in livestock in Great Britain was in 2006. Anthrax is a notifiable disease. That means if you suspect it you must tell the Animal and Plant and Health Agency ( APHA ) immediately. Failure to do so is an offence. How to spot anthrax In cattle and sheep Cattle and sheep can die quickly from anthrax, but their carcasses may show no obvious signs of the disease. But the length of the illness varies and some animals may have signs of illness for several days before death. In such cases the main clinical signs are: high temperature, shivering or twitching harsh dry cough blood in dung or in nostrils decrease or complete loss of milk fits bright staring eyes colicky pains dejection and loss of appetite In pigs and horses Anthrax can cause death in pigs and horses, though less quickly than in cattle and sheep. The main clinical signs of anthrax in pigs and horses are: hot painful swellings in the throat area sudden colic pain in horses loss of appetite in pigs Risk to humans Anthrax symptoms begin with a flu-like illness. This is then followed by respiratory difficulties. Direct contact with anthrax can cause raised boil-like lesions on the skin which develop a black centre. This skin infection normally responds to early treatment with antibiotics. If you inhale anthrax spores, they can cause damage to the lungs, which is often fatal. How anthrax is spread Anthrax is spread when its spores are inhaled, ingested, or come into contact with skin lesions. The spores can survive for decades or even centuries. They are found on infected animal carcasses, wool, hair and hides. Preventing and controlling anthrax Preventing anthrax Talk to your vet before moving or disposing of carcasses after a sudden or unexplained death. You can also help to prevent anthrax by practising strict biosecurity on your premises. If you suspect anthrax If you suspect anthrax: contact your local APHA office immediately and isolate the animal or carcass do not move, skin or open the carcass of any suspect animal disinfect blood or other fluids from any suspect animal, as soon as possible, with a Defra approved disinfectant do not kill or bleed any sick animals watch any animals that have been in contact with the suspect animal, and isolate them if they show signs of infection pay particular attention to cows, as humans can be infected by drinking contaminated milk If anthrax is confirmed If anthrax is confirmed, there are legal powers to control the spread of the disease during an outbreak. If you think your animals will be continually exposed to anthrax, for example, after an outbreak, talk to your vet about using an antibiotic or a vaccine. Your local authority will pay for the disposal of any diseased carcasses. Further information on prevention and control Controls to prevent disease What happens when a notifiable disease is suspected or confirmed Legislation relating to anthrax The main domestic legislation on anthrax is The Anthrax Order of 1991 ."

/government/news/porcine-epidemic-diarrhoea-ped-becomes-notifiable-disease-in-england,"From Friday 18 December, it is a legal requirement to notify APHA of suspect and confirmed cases of PED in pigs in England. Porcine epidemic diarrhoea (PED) becomes notifiable disease in England  Animal and Plant Health Agency Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs This measure has been introduced by government following discussions between pig industry bodies and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs ( Defra ). Unlike other notifiable diseases in pigs, there is no legislative requirement for official testing, culling, movement controls or other restrictions. Controlling the disease will be industry-led. Under the new legislation, the Animal and Plant Health Agency ( APHA ) is legally permitted to inform the industry levy board, Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board Pork ( AHDB Pork ) of all suspect and confirmed cases. AHDB Pork will use this information for the purposes of disease control, by providing biosecurity advice to the pig unit concerned and alerting those at risk. Chief Veterinary Officer, Nigel Gibbens said: We have made porcine epidemic diarrhoea a notifiable disease in consultation with the pig industry to better protect our pig herds from the high impact virus strains which have been reported affecting pigs in America, Asia and Ukraine. By reporting all suspect cases, farmers can help identify outbreaks of the disease earlier and give pig keepers and their vets more time to take action to minimise the impact on our pig industry. In the event of an outbreak, AHDB will share information with those affected or at risk and will provide help and advice on maintaining strict biosecurity standards and other measures to control disease and reduce the risk of spread of infection.” Porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus ( PEDV ) is a coronavirus that infects the cells lining the small intestine of a pig, causing severe diarrhoea and dehydration. The disease is most serious in new born sucking piglets, where the strain of PEDV which causes more severe disease can result in mortality up to 100%. PEDV is harmless to humans and other farm animals and is not a food safety risk. It is highly infectious and is mainly spread by infected pigs and anything contaminated with their infected faeces. Its spread can however be controlled if scrupulous biosecurity measures are followed. PED remains a significant threat to British pig herds. Outbreaks of a high-impact strain of PEDV have been detected in North America, Asia and more recently the Ukraine. There have been no reports of this strain in the European Union, including the UK, but there are other strains of PEDV circulating in mainland Europe. Making PED notifiable in England will enable the pig industry to take prompt and targeted action to manage any PED outbreaks more effectively. See the guidance on porcine epidemic diarrhoea: how to spot and report the disease . See also the AHDB Pork ’s PEDV website for further information."

/government/news/scientists-awarded-ebola-medal-for-service-in-west-africa,"A group of volunteers from the Animal and Plant Health Agency have been awarded the Ebola medal for their work in Sierra Leone. Scientists awarded Ebola medal for service in West Africa  Animal and Plant Health Agency The UK Government issued a call for suitably experienced scientists to help with the mounting humanitarian crisis in West Africa caused by the Ebola outbreak In October 2014. 9 volunteers from the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) immediately offered their valuable laboratory skills. After a week’s training the volunteers were flown out to work as part of a team of scientists and healthcare specialists at 2 British built sites in Sierra Leone, namely the Mateneh Ebola Treatment Centre, run by the International Medical Corps and a treatment centre in Port Loko, run by the charity GOAL. Both centres also housed diagnostic laboratories which had been set up by Public Health England. APHA Chief Executive, Chris Hadkiss, presenting some of the volunteers with their medals, commented: “To volunteer to travel to an Ebola infected country, in support of the humanitarian work, was an incredibly selfless act and I commend everyone’s bravery and dedication. “It is thanks to the efforts of all these volunteers, working alongside local healthcare workers that so many areas have been declared Ebola free and so many lives have been saved.” The special medal, approved by Her Majesty The Queen, was awarded to those military and civilian personnel who supported the government’s response to the Ebola crisis that began in 2014. People who have received the medal include armed forces personnel, doctors and nurses from the NHS, scientists and public health specialists and members of the civil service and non-governmental organisations. Virologist Anna La Rocca found it a difficult but rewarding experience: “When we arrived, our main job was to test patient samples and get accurate results as soon as possible so that people could be treated or released. We also had to quickly test samples from the surrounding community to allow a rapid response to any new outbreak.” Bacteriologist Roland Ashford commented: “The Mateneh diagnostic laboratory was of a good standard, given the location and the speed with which it had to be constructed. It had to be staffed for 16 hours a day, every day of the week in order to meet the demands for testing samples from the community.” Biochemist Gareth Williams added: “The location of the laboratory within the Mateneh ETC meant samples could be submitted directly and the results made available within four hours. This was crucial in allowing the medical teams to decide how patients should be managed. “The laboratory was also used to establish when convalescing patients were no longer infectious and could be released from the treatment centre. These patients would mark their recovery by leaving a handprint on a ‘Survivors’ Wall’, which in itself was a very moving reminder of the seriousness of the outbreak.”"

/government/news/london-egg-packer-found-guilty-of-egg-marketing-fraud,"A London egg packer and wholesaler has been fined for extending ‘best before’ dates on eggs and breaching compliance notices issued by APHA egg marketing inspectors. London egg packer and wholesaler found guilty of egg marketing fraud  Animal and Plant Health Agency Ziya Gorur pleaded not guilty before the District Judge at Waltham Forest Magistrates Court on Thursday 21 January, but was found guilty on all 4 charges after a 3 and a half hour trial. He was fined £2,515 (£500 per offence plus £500 court costs and a £15 surcharge) under the Eggs and Chicks (England) Regulations 2009 . In summing up, the District Judge praised the professional manner in which the Animal and Plant Health Agency’s ( APHA ) egg marketing inspectors carried out their enforcement roles. When Ziya Gorur was inspected by APHA , inspectors found that eggs at 2 separate stalls at New Spitalfields Market, Leyton, had been falsely dated. Batches of eggs were found to be individually marked on the shell with a date of 25 April, despite the eggs having been re-packed with a label showing a best before date of either 8 or 10 May. At around the same time, egg marketing inspectors issued 2 compliance notices to Mr Gorur regarding 2 batches of eggs that had been downgraded for failing to meet the class A quality standards. Despite clear instructions both verbally and in writing, Mr Gorur chose not to adhere to these requirements, breaching both compliance notices. APHA Lead Inspector Tim Platt, said: Consumers rely on honest egg marketing to ensure that the eggs they buy are fresh and safe to eat. This case should serve as a warning and reminder that APHA enforces egg marketing legislation robustly and that deliberate transgressions result in tough sanctions for those not willing to comply."

There are many different types of influenza viruses. They can also affect humans and birds, though these strains of the virus are usually different from those that affect pigs. Swine influenza is present in pigs in most countries around the world, including the UK. Pigs can carry many different types of the disease. Swine influenza should not be confused with either classical swine fever or African swine fever , which are different diseases. Swine influenza is not a notifiable disease but if you spot signs of this disease in animals you should contact your vet. How to spot swine influenza Swine flu infection usually results in respiratory disease. The severity of the disease depends on the strain of virus involved and the age of the affected pigs. The clinical signs can include: sneezing, coughing and difficulty breathing abortions (in some cases) increased discharge from eyes or nose high temperature loss of appetite weakness swollen and red eyes The disease can affect many pigs in a herd at the same time, but not all of them will show signs of illness. Pigs are unlikely to die from swine influenza, unless they are very young or have other infections. Infected animals will usually recover in 5 to 7 days. If infected pigs are suffering from other respiratory diseases, the symptoms may be worse and they may take longer to recover. Risk to humans Swine influenza may occasionally pass to humans, but this depends on the strain of the virus. It causes similar symptoms to a seasonal flu. It is not usually a life-threatening illness. To get more information on swine influenza in humans read Public Health England’s guide. If you or your employees work with pigs, you should read the Health and Safety Executive’s guide to zoonoses (animal diseases which can affect humans). How swine influenza spreads The infection is spread through direct contact between pigs. When infected pigs sneeze or cough, they can spread the disease to nearby pigs. The virus may survive in carrier pigs for several weeks without them showing any clinical signs. These carrier pigs can then be a source of infection for other pigs. It can also be spread by wild animals and birds or indirectly via contaminated equipment, clothing, feed or water. Preventing and controlling swine influenza Preventing swine influenza Follow the influenza in pigs code of practice to reduce the risk of your animals getting infected and to minimise the spread of the disease. You can also help prevent swine influenza by practising strict biosecurity on your premises. Some other viral and bacterial pig diseases may cause similar disease signs, so a laboratory diagnosis may be required to confirm swine flu. If you suspect swine influenza, you should talk to your vet. They can arrange to have samples tested for swine influenza by the Animal and Plant Health Agency ( APHA ).

/government/collections/notifiable-diseases-in-animals,"A collection of guides to notifiable diseases in animals, including what happens if a disease is suspected or confirmed. Notifiable diseases in animals Reporting disease and disease outbreaks Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Animal and Plant Health Agency ‘Notifiable’ diseases are animal diseases that you’re legally obliged to report to the Animal and Plant Health Agency ( APHA ), even if you only suspect that an animal may be affected. Notifiable diseases can be: endemic – already present in the UK, such as bovine TB exotic – not normally present in the UK, such as foot and mouth disease Some endemic and exotic diseases are zoonotic which means they can pass between animals and humans, such as rabies. If you suspect a notifiable disease you must tell the Animal and Plant Health Agency immediately – failure to do this is an offence. What happens if you suspect a notifiable disease If you suspect an exotic notifiable disease: Report it to your nearest APHA office. APHA vets will investigate – they usually visit your premises and carry out an enquiry. The APHA duty vet will tell you what restrictions should be applied to your premises before the APHA veterinary inspector arrives. If the APHA veterinary inspector suspects a notifiable disease, they will take samples for testing (this may involve killing the suspected animal before taking samples). They put restrictions on your premises. This means you must at least stop moving animals susceptible to the disease on or off the premises. It can also include stopping the movement of anything that can transmit disease, like meat products, equipment or vehicles. If certain diseases are suspected (particularly foot and mouth disease or African horse sickness) a temporary control zone will be introduced around your premises. This restricts the movements of animals susceptible to the disease. Restrictions remain in place until the investigation is complete and an exotic notifiable disease is ruled out. What happens if a notifiable disease is confirmed If a notifiable disease is confirmed: Action will be taken on the infected premises to reduce the risk of the disease spreading, including movement restrictions. For some diseases, like foot and mouth disease and African swine fever, this will include culling all susceptible animals. Premises are then cleaned and disinfected with strict rules on restocking. The government investigates where the disease came from and whether it has spread. The government puts restrictions on all premises where the disease is likely to have spread from or to (for example when animals have been moved). Further restrictions in a wider area may be introduced, depending on the risk of the disease spreading. In the case of foot and mouth disease in particular, animal movements would be restricted throughout the country. For some diseases control zones are automatically applied. APHA will tell you what action to take – this depends on the nature of the disease and EU requirements. The following activities that could spread disease may be banned: hunting or shooting animal gatherings (like shows) exports Controlling exotic notifiable diseases Contingency plans outline how the government will manage an exotic notifiable disease outbreak: Contingency plan for exotic notifiable diseases for England United Kingdom contingency plan for exotic notifiable diseases of animals How to prevent notifiable diseases You can help prevent notifiable diseases by following: strict biosecurity practices rules on imports and exports rules on feeding to farmed livestock Animals or birds spared from culling For most notifiable diseases, there are legal powers to cull animals to prevent the spread of disease during an outbreak. Certain animals and birds, including breeds at risk, may be spared from culling if this doesn’t compromise controlling the disease (this isn’t guaranteed). Find out more about animals and birds that may be spared from culling .

/guidance/avian-influenza-bird-flu,"How to spot avian influenza (bird flu), what to do if you suspect it, and measures to prevent it. Avian influenza (bird flu)  Animal and Plant Health Agency Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Avian influenza (bird flu) mainly affects birds. It can also affect humans and other mammals. Some strains of avian influenza cause a notifiable disease. If you suspect any strain of avian flu you must tell your nearest Animal and Plant and Health Agency ( APHA ) office immediately. Failure to do so is an offence. Poultry keepers should remain vigilant for signs of disease and maintain the highest levels of biosecurity at all times. If you have any concerns, seek prompt advice from your vet. Sign up to our Alerts Service to keep up to date with the latest news. You must register your poultry if you have flocks of 50 or more birds. Registering your poultry will help us contact you quickly during an outbreak of disease. Latest situation Case in Dunfermline, Scotland, January 2016 A case of low severity (H5N1) avian influenza (bird flu) was confirmed by the Scottish authorities on a poultry breeding farm in Dunfermline on 13 January 2016. Restrictions around the affected site were lifted on 11 February 2016. We have published an epidemiological report summarising our investigations into the case . About avian influenza How to spot avian influenza There are 2 types of avian influenza. Highly pathogenic avian influenza ( HPAI ) is the more serious type. It is often fatal in birds. The main clinical signs of HPAI in birds are: swollen head blue discolouration of neck and throat loss of appetite respiratory distress such as gaping beak, coughing, sneezing, gurgling, rattling diarrhoea fewer eggs laid increased mortality Clinical signs can vary between species of bird and some species may show minimal clinical signs (ducks and geese). Low pathogenic avian influenza ( LPAI ) is usually less serious. It can cause mild breathing problems, but affected birds will not always show clear signs of infection. The severity of LPAI depends on the type of bird and whether it has any other illnesses. How avian influenza is spread The disease spreads from bird to bird by direct contact or through contaminated body fluids and faeces. The avian influenza virus changes frequently creating new strains and there is a constant risk that one of the new strains may spread easily among people. But there is no evidence that any recent strain of avian influenza has been able to spread directly between people. Avian influenza isn’t an airborne disease. Biosecurity guidance Anyone who keeps poultry must be vigilant for any signs of disease, and must seek prompt advice from their vet if they have any concerns. You can help prevent avian flu by maintaining good biosecurity on your premises at all times. Measures include: cleansing and disinfecting protective clothing, footwear, equipment and vehicles before and after contact with poultry; if practicable use disposable protective clothing minimising potential contamination from manure, slurry and other products that could carry disease, by reducing movements of people, vehicles or equipment into and from areas where poultry are kept thoroughly cleaning and disinfecting housing at the end of a cycle having disinfectant and cleaning material ready at farm entrances, so essential visitors can disinfect themselves before entering and leaving premises minimising contact between poultry and wild birds Read our guidance: !@1 Guidance for the public Public health Some strains of avian influenza can pass to humans, but this is very rare. It usually requires very close contact between the human and infected birds. The Food Standards Agency advises that properly cooked poultry and poultry products, including eggs, are safe to eat. More information on avian influenza in people is available from Public Health England . If you employ people who work with poultry or work with poultry yourself, you can also read advice from the Health and Safety Executive on protecting workers from avian influenza . Wild birds If you find 5 or more wild birds dead in the same location, you should report them to the Defra helpline (Tel: 03459 33 55 77). Movement controls and licences No specific movement controls or licences currently apply. Bird fairs, markets, shows and other gatherings We have published guidance on when you need a licence for a bird gathering and how to follow the licence conditions . Compensation You may be entitled to compensation if your poultry are killed under orders from government or APHA in the event of a disease outbreak. Trade, import and export issues We summarise any current issues for UK poultry and poultry product exports on our topical issues page . We also have a collection of guidance and forms for importing and exporting live animals or animal products . Recent cases in England A case of H7N7 avian flu was confirmed near Preston, Lancashire on 13 July 2015. A low severity case of H7N7 was confirmed on 2 February 2015 in chickens at a farm in Hampshire. A case of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N8 was confirmed on 16 November 2014 in ducks on premises in East Yorkshire. Restrictions around the affected sites were lifted on 16 August 2015, 28 February 2015, and 21 December 2014, respectively. We have published reports about the investigations we carried out . Earlier papers about these cases are available on the National Archives website . Control strategy Disease control strategy Cases of avian influenza, if they occur, are controlled by following the contingency plan for exotic notifiable diseases and the notifiable avian disease control strategy .

/guidance/newcastle-disease,"How to spot Newcastle disease, what to do if you suspect it and measures to prevent its spread. Newcastle disease: how to spot and report it  Animal and Plant Health Agency Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Newcastle disease affects chickens and other captive and wild birds. Humans aren’t normally affected, but people in direct contact with infected birds may develop a very short-term eye infection, which passes without treatment. The disease was last confirmed in Great Britain in 2006. Newcastle disease is a notifiable disease. That means if you suspect it you must tell the Animal and Plant Health Agency ( APHA ) immediately. Failure to do so is an offence. How to spot Newcastle disease As the disease develops affected birds may show some of the following signs: respiratory distress such as gaping beak, coughing, sneezing, gurgling, rattling nervous signs characterised by tremors and paralysis and twisting of the neck unusually watery faeces (diarrhoea) that are yellowish-green in colour depression lack of appetite Affected hens may also suddenly produce fewer eggs. Eggs that are laid may be soft-shelled. The disease may lead to intense clinical signs, with a sudden onset leading to likely death. Or it may have a lesser affect, with breathing problems and lower egg production the only detectable clinical signs. How Newcastle disease is spread The disease is spread by direct contact with bodily fluids of infected birds, especially their faeces. It can also be spread indirectly through people and objects that have been in contact with infected birds, or their excretions (such as faeces). Objects that can carry the disease include: vehicles equipment clothing water and feed The disease can spread from wild to kept birds. Pigeons may carry pigeon paramyxovirus , which can cause Newcastle disease in kept birds. Preventing and controlling Newcastle disease You can help prevent the disease by: vaccinating your animals against the disease - talk to your vet for advice practising strict biosecurity on your premises If you report suspicion of Newcastle disease, APHA vets will investigate. If the disease is confirmed, the outbreak will be controlled in line with the contingency plan for exotic notifiable diseases and the control strategy for notifiable avian diseases will be implemented. Further information on prevention and control Controls to prevent disease What happens when a notifiable disease is suspected or confirmed Legislation on Newcastle disease Newcastle disease is covered by the Diseases of Poultry (England) Order 2003 ."

/guidance/rabies-in-bats,"Signs that may suggest rabies in bats, what to do if you spot them and measures to prevent exposing yourself to the disease. Rabies in bats: how to spot it and report it  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Animal and Plant Health Agency It is possible, although rare, for a bat infected with rabies to pass the disease on to other mammals, including humans. The most recent case of rabies in a bat in Great Britain was in September 2016. Rabies in bats is a notifiable disease. That means if you suspect it you must tell the Animal and Plant Health Agency ( APHA ) immediately. Failure to do so is an offence. Signs that a bat may have rabies Infected bats may not show any signs of rabies. Infection can only be confirmed in a laboratory. But clinical signs in bats may include: behaviour changes: infected animals are prone to more aggression disorientation and difficulty flying (infected bats may be injured as a result) eyes taking on a staring expression How rabies is spread Rabies is present in the saliva of infected bats and is usually spread by the bite of an infected bat. The disease can also be spread if the saliva of an infected animal gets into open wounds or mucous membranes such as the nostrils, mouth and lips, eyelids and ears. Risk to humans from infected bats Humans can catch rabies from a bat, although this is very unusual as the disease is very rare among bats in Great Britain. In humans symptoms of the disease include: anxiety, headaches and fever in early stages spasms of the swallowing muscles making it difficult or impossible to drink breathing difficulties There are vaccinations against rabies, and the disease can normally be prevented if you are treated soon after exposure. But once signs of rabies appear, there is no treatment. Past human cases have been fatal. Read the NHS guide to rabies for more information about the disease in humans. How to avoid catching rabies from a bat You should be vaccinated against rabies if you regularly handle bats. If you have not been vaccinated against the disease: assume that all bats are possible carriers of rabies avoid touching bats, living or dead, whenever possible if you must touch a bat, follow the Bat Conservation Trust guidance and wear thick gloves to avoid being bitten or scratched If you are bitten or scratched by a bat If you have been bitten or scratched by a bat, or exposed to bat saliva or nervous tissue in any other way, you must: wash the wound or contact area with soap and water disinfect the wound contact a doctor immediately who will decide whether you need treatment If you find a dead bat If you find a dead bat: do not directly handle the bat if possible contact the Bat Conservation Trust Helpline on 0345 1300 228 for help if you have to touch the bat follow the Bat Conservation Trust guidance and use thick gloves If your pet finds a bat It is possible, although very rare, for infected bats to pass rabies to other animals including pets. If your pet catches a bat, keep your pet under observation. If your pet falls sick or starts behaving unusually, you must contact your vet immediately. Your vet will tell APHA if he or she suspects your pet has rabies. If you suspect rabies in a bat If you report suspicion of rabies in a bat, APHA vets will investigate and may submit the bat for testing to see whether the signs were caused by rabies. Monitoring rabies in bats in Great Britain APHA tests dead bats submitted by the public to monitor how widespread the disease is in Great Britain. Only 13 infected bats have been found in more than 12,000 tests since 1986, so the risk of catching rabies from a bat is very low."

How to use, store or move manure, guano and digestive tract content  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Animal and Plant Health Agency Manure is excrement or urine from any farmed animal apart from fish. It can include litter (pieces of animal bedding). Guano is excrement from bats or wild sea birds. Digestive tract content is any content from the digestive tract of a mammal or ratite (ostrich, emu or rhea). You send any of these products to a compost or biogas facility . Processing manure, guano and digestive tract content into fertiliser You can sell manure, guano or digestive tract content as fertiliser in the EU if you meet certain processing requirements. Find out how to process manure for sale as fertiliser in the EU . If you don’t meet EU processing standards you can still sell your product as fertiliser if you partially process it using heat or pressure. Partially processed manure or guano can be sold as a fertiliser in the UK, generally as a prill (dried pellets). Contact your nearest Animal and Plant Health Agency ( APHA ) field office to apply for approval to make fertiliser from partially processed manure or guano. Digestive tract content can be processed into a prill and sold as a fertiliser made from processed ABPs . Read the guide to fertilisers made from processed ABPs to find out restrictions that apply to prills made from digestive tract content. Get approval to store fertiliser You need approval to store an organic fertiliser or soil improver if you receive a fertiliser made from manure, guano or digestive tract content in bulk and then repackage it for final sale. Contact your nearest APHA field office to seek approval. When you can spread manure, guano and digestive tract content on land If the manure, guano or digestive tract content isn’t from poultry you can do the following without restrictions under ABP regulations: spread it on your own land (you may need an Environment Agency waste disposal permit , unless you qualify for an exemption from waste permitting ) supply it for use on other farms or markets gardens It is good practice to avoid spreading manure, guano or digestive tract content on land where farmed animals have access or to stop animals grazing on the land for 21 days (or for 2 months in the case of pigs) if it has been spread to land. Further restrictions may be imposed during an outbreak of a notifiable disease, but these would be publicised at the time. Requirements for spreading poultry manure on land You can spread poultry manure on your own land or supply it for use on other farms and markets gardens if you take the following steps to avoid the spread of botulism: inspect your birds regularly and remove any dead ones from the litter immediately so carcasses don’t end up in the manure don’t dispose of feathers or cracked eggs in your manure (some feathers will naturally fall into the litter but don’t dump bulk quantities, eg after the slaughter of turkeys at Christmas) If a botulism outbreak is traced to your farm the government investigation will take into account: your practice for dealing with carcasses the quantities of feathers and eggshells found in your manure If you spread poultry manure on land where farmed animals graze you should stop animals grazing on the land for 21 days (or 2 months for pigs). You also need to: stack the manure as far as possible from the livestock fence it in until you use it Burn poultry manure to generate power You can only burn manure that’s: unprocessed from your own farm or holding You must get approval from APHA to burn poultry manure in a combustion unit with an output below 5MW. If your combustion unit output is above 5MW, you must contact: the Environment Agency if you’re in England or Wales the Scottish Environment Protection Agency if you’re in Scotland Use cattle manure to make cattle bedding You can process some types of recycled manure solids ( RMS ) for use as cattle bedding, sometimes called green bedding. Find out how to use recycled manure solids as cattle bedding . You must also complete and keep a self-assessment and annual vet review form to show the Red Tractor assessor and your vet, who’ll review your use of RMS as bedding. Unprocessed manure that can be sent to other EU states You can seek permission to send the following types of unprocessed manure to other EU states: unprocessed equine manure (if your farm is not subject to animal health restrictions due to glanders, vesicular stomatitis, anthrax or rabies) unprocessed poultry manure (if the farm or holding where the manure was produced isn’t in an area subject to animal health restrictions due to avian influenza or Newcastle Disease) You can’t send unprocessed poultry manure from flocks vaccinated against Newcastle disease to a region which has gained non-vaccinated status under EU law. In some cases you may be able to send other types of unprocessed manure, including sea bird guano, to 1 of the following: an approved bio gas plant an approved plant specifically for the processing of manure a specific piece of land, where the manure is going to be applied In these cases the UK government would have to consult with the government of the EU state the manure is being sent to before giving you permission. You can’t send unprocessed bat guano to other EU states. How to seek permission to send unprocessed manure to another EU state You should contact the APHA Specialist Service Centre in Carlisle for advice, if you want to send unprocessed manure to another EU state. How to trade manure outside the EU Contact the APHA Specialist Service Centre in Carlisle if you want to: import processed manure from a country outside the EU export processed or unprocessed manure to a country outside the EU You can’t import unprocessed manure from countries outside the EU . Storing manure, guano or digestive tract content You don’t need approval to store manure, guano or digestive tract content at the: farm or premises where it’s produced place where it’s going to be used (as long as it’s stacked or kept in a slurry tank or tanker until used) Digestive tract content from abattoirs is normally mixed with lairage manure (manure produced by animals at the abattoir). You don’t need approval to store the tract content at the abbatoir or the lairage manure at the place where it’s going to be used. If you are storing manure, guano or digestive tract content anywhere other than where it was produced or where it’s going to be used, the storage site must be approved to store category 2 ABP material. Complete form ABPR3 to get approved to store ABP material and send it to your nearest APHA field office . Transporting manure, guano or digestive tract content If you move digestive tract content or guano off the premises where it was produced, you must follow the requirements for transporting ABP material and keeping commercial documents with ABP material . You must also follow the transport and commercial document requirements when handling manure except in the following cases: when moving manure between farms when moving manure from a farm to place where it’s going to be used You don’t need to label manure, guano or digestive tract content as ABP material."
/guidance/animal-by-product-categories-site-approval-hygiene-and-disposal,"What animal by-products (ABPs) are, how to set up a site that uses them safely, the paperwork you need, and how to dispose of them. Animal by-product categories, site approval, hygiene and disposal  Animal and Plant Health Agency Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs ABPs are animal carcasses, parts of animals, or other materials which come from animals but are not meant for humans to eat. They can either be destroyed or can be used to make compost, biogas or other products. ABP categories explained ABPs are divided into 3 categories, based on the risks they pose. Category 1 ABPs Category 1 ABPs are classed as high risk. They include: carcasses and all body parts of animals suspected of being infected with TSE (transmissible spongiform encephalopathy) carcasses of wild animals suspected of being infected with a disease that humans or animals could contract carcasses of animals used in experiments parts of animals that are contaminated due to illegal treatments international catering waste carcasses and body parts from zoo and circus animals or pets specified risk material (body parts that pose a particular disease risk, eg cows’ spinal cords) Category 2 ABPs Category 2 ABPs are classed as high risk. They include: animals rejected from abattoirs due to having infectious diseases carcasses containing residues from authorised treatments unhatched poultry that has died in its shell carcasses of animals killed for disease control purposes carcasses of dead livestock manure digestive tract content Category 3 ABPs Category 3 ABPs are classed as low risk. They include: carcasses or body parts passed fit for humans to eat, at a slaughterhouse products or foods of animal origin originally meant for human consumption but withdrawn for commercial reasons, not because it’s unfit to eat domestic catering waste shells from shellfish with soft tissue eggs, egg by-products, hatchery by-products and eggshells aquatic animals, aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates hides and skins from slaughterhouses animal hides, skins, hooves, feathers, wool, horns, and hair that had no signs of infectious disease at death processed animal proteins (PAP) PAP are animal proteins processed from any category 3 ABP except: milk, colostrum or products derived from them eggs and egg products, including eggshells gelatine collagen hydrolysed proteins dicalcium phosphate and tricalcium phosphate of animal origin blood products (although any processed blood would still be subject to this guide) Getting your site approved or registered If your site uses ABPs , it needs to be approved by or registered with the Animal and Plant Health Agency ( APHA ). Whether you need approval or registration depends on what your site does and the ABPs you handle there. Sites that need approval You need approval if you are using ABPs at a: processing facility biodiesel factory site that makes pet food combustion site commercial compost or biogas/anaerobic digestion site site that makes organic fertiliser or soil improver site where boilers use tallow as fuel high or low capacity incinerator site handling or storage plant site that stores derived products How to get your site approved Complete an application form to get your site approved . Your application form needs to show: that you know how to set up and operate your plant that you’ve identified the most hazardous risk areas on your site that you have a workable plan to control these risks how you’ll maintain hygiene in common areas like canteens, offices, waste water plants and boilers what you’ll do if cross-contamination occurs how you’ll manage spillages of any ABPs or processed products how you’ll maintain equipment, clean it, and deal with any faults how you’ll train your staff to safely operate the site where you’ll store raw ABP materials and finished products After you’ve applied, APHA inspectors will then check your site to make sure you’re operating legally. Sites that must register You need to register your site if you use: blood or blood products, except if you’re using them in feed medical devices like heart valves hides, skins, wool, hair, pig bristles, feathers, down or related materials commercial game trophies or taxidermy pieces chemicals derived from plant or animal fats bee-keeping by-products bones, horns, hooves and related materials milk, milk-based and milk-derived products colostrum (milk from animals) and colostrum-based products ABPs for feeding zoo or circus animals, or other wild animals ABP samples for research or diagnostic tests (unless this is for education) You also have to register your site if it’s a: collection centre (any site where dead stock is collected for use as feed for carnivores) site that mixes components for organic fertilisers or soil improvers cosmetics manufacturing site landfill site pet cemetery medical or veterinary supply factory You also must register if you’re: a trader selling untreated agricultural wool or hair an animal keeper who gets hides and skins from your animals returned after slaughter handling ABPs as trade samples, or for exhibition and artistic uses a haulier or transporter who doesn’t work for an APHA -approved site or an FSA approved food or feed business How to register your site To get your site registered complete form AB117 and post it to APHA . When you don’t need registration or approval You don’t need to be registered to: run a farm, breeding farm or a shop which produces ABPs supply other farms with colostrum (milk from animals) for feeding dispose of category 2 and 3 materials on your site, if they came from surgery on a live animal (eg horns from calves) collect and transport manure between 2 places on the same farm, or between farmers within the UK make game trophies or taxidermy pieces that aren’t to be sold commercially use ABP samples for education, eg at a school, college, or university ABP hygiene on your site If you want to use different categories of ABPs on one site, you must: keep unprocessed ABPs in category-specific rooms, divided by floor-to-ceiling walls or partitions keep raw ABP material separate from any processed final products If you run a category 3 processing, handling or storage plant, you must do one of the following: keep any category 1 and category 2 materials in a separate building, that’s both: divided from the category 3 plant by floor-to-ceiling walls or partitions accessed by a dedicated entrance and exit prove to AHPA inspectors that you’re using an equally effective method to separate category 1 and 2 material from your category 3 plant Cleaning your site and vehicles You must clean and disinfect your site and any containers or vehicles used for storing or transporting ABPs . You should: make and enforce a cleaning plan for all areas of the site regularly inspect the site and all equipment to make sure they’re clean, and record the results have a waste-water disposal system disinfect vehicles fully, including the wheels, before they enter clean areas of your site make sure finished products are not contaminated by splashes or run-off have a pest control programme as protection against insects, rats, birds, and other pests ABP safety and your staff You must: control the movement of staff between areas that use different ABP materials make sure all clothing and footwear are disinfected after use make sure staff change protective clothing when moving between areas that use different categories of ABP use colour-coded protective clothing to identify staff working in clean or unclean areas clean and disinfect common areas like toilets, changing rooms, and canteens train staff so that they are familiar with your plant’s safety procedures and keep a record of the training keep a list of any staff who own livestock in case a notifiable disease breaks out ABP safety and your equipment Your equipment can spread diseases if you don’t clean and disinfect it. You should: check all equipment regularly to make sure it works use trained maintenance staff to fix any broken equipment only use each piece of equipment for a single category of ABP, and colour-code accordingly limit the movement of equipment between clean and unclean parts of your site wash and disinfect equipment, especially if you’re moving it between clean and unclean sectors use caustic decontamination for equipment that you’re moving from category 1 processing sites to category 2 or 3 Loading and unloading ABPs When you’re getting your site approved or registered, inspectors will check your loading and unloading method is safe. Generally, loading and unloading must be done inside, in a covered area, but inspectors may allow other methods. Loading and unloading ABPs next to the building If you can’t drive a vehicle inside your building, you may be allowed to load and unload by docking with the building. This means that a vehicle or container backs up to the building and empties or fills through a covered dock. This must not be open to the outside. Docking is more likely to be approved when the materials you’re transporting won’t spill, eg a carcass is safer than liquid waste. Unloading ABPs in outside yards Inspectors may allow certain ABPs to be unloaded in outside yards, if the materials are: moved into the building immediately stored in covered and leak-proof containers or sealed packages dry, eg fresh whole carcasses, fully salted hides, skins, horns, hooves They’ll also check that: your yard is made from concrete or another material that won’t let liquid seep through and contaminate the ground materials are not unloaded anywhere else on your site besides this yard Loading ABPs in outside yards If you want to load ABP materials in outside yards, inspectors will make sure: materials are held outside for the shortest possible amount of time, ideally loaded on the day of dispatch your containers are leak-proof and securely covered immediately after loading the ground under and around the container is made from concrete or another material that won’t let liquid seep through the ground can be cleaned and disinfected, and has a fall to a foul drain Keeping records and labelling If you’re moving consignments of ABPs or derived products, you must have a commercial document. The commercial document must list: a detailed description of the contents, including category and quantity the date of transport an address of origin and destination, and contact names at both approval or registration numbers for the factory or vehicle the signature of whoever is responsible for the contents ear numbers and details of species, where carcasses have been taken from farms You should keep a copy of the commercial document for at least 2 years. Keeping records of consignments You must keep a record of any consignments of ABPs or derived products that enter or exit your premises. You can do this using your commercial document or a logbook - you should record: the date you sent or received the consignment a description of the material you sent or received including its category the weight, volume and quantity of the material the place where you sent the material or the place it came from See [InlineAttachment:1]. Labelling When labelling ABP vehicles or containers you should measure quantity by: weight number of containers, with estimates of their average weight number, for example ‘85 tripes’ volume, for example ‘20,000 litres of bovine blood’ Vehicles, containers, or packaging must also have a label attached that says what category of ABP the contents are. You must use these wordings: category 1 material - ‘for disposal only’ category 2 material - ‘not for animal consumption’ category 3 material - ‘not for human consumption’ Disposing of ABPs Category 1 You can only dispose of category 1 ABPs by: incineration or co-incineration at an approved plant processing using processing methods 1-5 followed by permanent marking using GTH, then incineration or co-incineration pressure sterilisation (apart from possible TSE cases or animals killed under TSE eradication laws) followed by permanent marking, then landfill using them as fuel for combustion at an approved combustion plant sending them for burial at an authorised landfill, if they are international catering waste Category 2 You can only dispose of category 2 ABPs by: incinerating or co-incinerating without processing or with prior processing, when resulting material has to be marked with glyceroltriheptanoate (GTH) sending them to authorised landfill after processing by pressure sterilisation and marking with GTH making them into organic fertilisers/ soil improvers, after processing and marking with GTH composting or anaerobic digestion after processing by pressure sterilisation and marking with GTH (milk, milk products, eggs, egg products, digestive tract content, manure do not need processing, providing no risk of spreading serious transmissible disease) applying them to land, in the case of manure, digestive tract content, milk, milk products and colostrum, this can be done without processing using them in composting or anaerobic digestion, if they are materials coming from aquatic animals ensiled using them as fuel for combustion using them for manufacture of certain cosmetic products, medical devices and safe industrial or technical uses Category 3 You can only dispose of category 3 ABPs by: incineration or co-incineration sending them to landfill after they’ve been processed processing them, if they’re not decomposed or spoiled, and using them to make feed for farm animals (where allowed by the TSE /ABP regulations) processing them and using them to make petfood processing them and using them to make organic fertilisers and soil improvers using them in composting or anaerobic digestion ensiling (turning them into silage) if they come from aquatic animals applying them to land as a fertiliser, in some cases using them as fuel for combustion using them to make cosmetic products or medical devices Disposing of small quantities of ABPs If you are a retailer, a distributor, or a manufacturer, you can send up to 20kg of raw or partially cooked meat, fish or shellfish products to landfill every week. This is a weekly limit, not an average limit over a number of weeks."

Using animal by-products at compost and biogas sites  Animal and Plant Health Agency Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Get your site approved You need approval from the Animal and Plant Health Agency ( APHA ) to run a compost or biogas site. Complete form ABPR1 to get approval to operate . Getting a hub and pod site approved If you intend to use one site for pasteurisation and another for anaerobic digestion, you must get both sites approved. The site where you collect and pasteurise materials is known as the hub - complete form ABPR33 to get a hub site approved . The site you use for anaerobic digestion is known as the pod - complete form ABPR1 to get a pod site approved . Getting your site validated After applying for approval, you must validate each biogas or composting system with the APHA . APHA inspectors will visit your site and check that: your machinery and set-ups meet legal requirements your site operator understands how you’ll control risks and how the plant works You’ll have to show them a plan for how you intend to make sure your site operates legally. Learn more about how your site must be set up . Contact your nearest APHA field office to start the validation process. You must keep any compost or digestate you produce during the validation period at your factory, or at a storage facility. You can’t sell or use your product until you have 4 clear validation tests. Testing samples for bacteria during validation During validation you must send samples of your compost or digestate for laboratory testing to check if your treatment is removing bacteria. You must test for Salmonella and either E.coli or Enterococcaceae. How often to take samples Take samples from each batch of compost or digestate you produce, if you process in batches. Take samples once a week if you use a continuous processing method. Find out more about laboratory testing requirements for ABPs including details of how and when to take samples and where to send them for testing. Requirements to pass validation Your samples must pass 12 consecutive tests for each bacteria before your site is validated. If one of your samples fails a test during validation, you must start the validation process again. Trial period You can define how many days production constitutes a batch - but if a batch fails a test you will have to reprocess it. You must submit samples from 12 batches during the trial period. You must extend the trial period beyond 12 batches if you don’t process enough batches to submit 12 samples in 12 weeks. If one of your samples fails a test during the 12 week trial period, you must start the trial period again. You must have 4 clear test results from your first 4 batches before you can start to sell your product, on a batch by batch basis. If a batch fails you must start the trial period again from week 1, and you will not be allowed to sell until 4 consecutive batches pass. Which standards apply to your site? You’ll have to meet either EU or UK composting and biogas standards at your site, depending on which category of ABPs you use. You can learn about different categories of ABP . When you must meet EU standards Your site must operate to EU standards if it treats: Category 3 ABPs that are not catering waste Category 2 ABPs that has first been pressure rendered at an approved site Mechanical biological treatment ( MBT ) plants that make compost for use on land or over landfill must also meet EU standards. If your MBT plant treats materials before they are incinerated or sent to landfill, no controls will apply. EU standards explained Under EU standards, your factory must: treat ABPs at 70°C for 1 hour with a maximum particle size of 12mm sterilise Category 2 ABPs at 133°C with 3 bar pressure, for 20 minutes at an approved plant, prior to treatment compost in a closed vessel system approved (as part of your site approval) by APHA include a pasteurisation stage in anaerobic digestion of Category 3 ABPs When you can meet UK standards Your site can operate to UK standards if all you treat is category 3 catering waste and the following category 2 ABPs : manure digestive tract and its content dairy products or colostrum eggs or egg products UK standards explained This table shows the time and temperature requirements you must follow for treating ABPs , as well as particle size rules, under UK standards: System Minimum temp Minimum time at minimum temp Maximum particle size Composting (closed reactor) 60°C 2 days 400mm Biogas 57°C 5 hours 50mm Composting (closed reactor) or biogas 70°C 1 hour 60mm Composting (housed windrow) 60°C 8 days (during which windrow must be turned at least 3 times, at no less than 2 day intervals) 400mm Using external heat If your composting or biogas site is in England or Wales, you can use external heat to treat ABPs , but you must follow the UK time and temperature requirements. In composting plants, the operator must be able to prove to inspectors that the majority of the heat is coming from within the system. UK standards for catering waste If your biogas or compost factory is operating under UK standards, the way you must treat catering waste depends on whether it’s meat-excluded, or non-meat-excluded. Waste is meat-excluded if measures have been taken at source to keep it away from meat. To be considered meat-excluded, it must also be kept separate after collection and at all stages of transport. Learn more about transporting ABPs . Biogas sites and catering waste Biogas sites must either: treat only meat-excluded catering waste store non-meat-excluded catering waste for 18 days after treatment Composting sites and catering waste Composting sites must compost: meat-excluded catering waste in one stage, then store the material for 18 days non-meat-excluded catering waste in 2 stages, the first stage in a closed vessel If you are composting packaging, it’s non-meat-excluded if it’s contaminated with blood or other ABPs . Sampling during normal operating During normal operating, you must continue to take samples. For each bacteria you need to test for, take either: a sample from 1 in every 4 batches of compost or digestate you produce 1 sample of compost or digestate a month You can chose the option that is less frequent, but you must take at least 1 sample a quarter, even if you don’t process 4 batches in a particular quarter. You must immediately tell your local APHA office if one of your samples fails a test. Other treatment methods (alternative transformation) If you can prove through testing that your end product is safe, you may be able to treat ABPs using your own processing paramaters instead of those that meet UK or EU standards. Talk to your local APHA office to find out what you need to do to have your parameters validated and approved. Storing compost or digestate You don’t need approval to store compost or digestate at the site where it’s produced or where it’s going to be used. If you’re storing finished product anywhere other than where it was produced or where it’s going to be used, the storage site must be approved to store ABP material.

The names of registered transporters are included in the list of ABP operating plants . Vehicle hygiene and storage When you’re transporting ABPs or any ABP derived products, you must make sure you: use vehicles and containers that are covered and leak-proof clean, disinfect, and dry vehicles and containers before and after every use keep different categories of ABPs in separate containers and separate parts of the vehicle only move animal protein in a vehicle designed for that purpose alone Find out about the 3 different categories of ABPs . Preventing ABPs from leaking If you leak ABPs in transport, you may be prosecuted by local authorities. You must make sure you check: the seals near the tailgate of your vehicle the strength of your vehicle’s fabric Using split trailers Split trailers must be associated with an approved plant or a registered haulier. If you’re using a split trailer to move ABPs , you must: separate any ABPs by category make sure the driver inspects the trailer before every use An APHA officer can inspect your trailer and stop you from using it to transport different categories of ABP , if they find the trailer doesn’t separate ABPs by category. Loading and unloading split trailers When you’re loading split trailers, each section must be identifiable by the category of ABP that’s stored there. The owner of the plant or haulier that the split trailer is associated with must pick a person who they are directly or contractually responsible for, to load and unload it. You must unload the trailer starting with the lowest risk ABPs , so when you’re loading it, you should put: category 3 ABPs at the rear category 2 in a section in the middle category 1 at the front You should then tip the front section of the trailer in the category 1 reception area, before cleaning and disinfecting the vehicle.

/government/news/apha-vet-wins-pig-industry-award,"Dr Susanna Williamson, an Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) vet, has won the 2016 David Black Award which is awarded by AHDB Pork.  APHA vet wins pig industry award  Animal and Plant Health Agency The David Black Award is the highest award within the pig industry which recognises an individual’s valuable and sustained contribution to the industry and has been presented annually since 1960. It is named after the East Anglian pig producer who introduced it. The judges’ citation said: “Susanna has devoted her time, energy and considerable talent in service to pig producers and she contributes greatly to keeping this country safe from the threats of existing and emerging disease.” Dr Williamson leads APHA’s Pig Expert Group and is President of the Pig Veterinary Society. She received the award from Lord Gardiner, Defra Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Rural Affairs and Biosecurity, at an industry breakfast in the House of Lords. She said: “I didn’t even know I had been nominated and that would have surprised me, let alone finding out that I would receive the award. “I appreciate the honour but really owe this award to my colleagues. I can only fulfil my role in pig disease surveillance and investigation through working as part of a team, within APHA and also with colleagues in the pig industry and pig veterinary community.” “Successful disease surveillance is about working in partnership, and also requires access to a wide range of veterinary, scientific and technical expertise. This is especially important as the industry strives to address disease issues and minimise antimicrobial use.” Dr Williamson has been based in APHA Bury St Edmunds since 2000, arriving shortly before an outbreak of classical swine fever which led to nearly 75,000 pigs being slaughtered to eradicate the disease. She has since been involved in the diagnosis and investigation of many disease outbreaks in pigs, along with projects on bacterial and viral diseases of pigs. She leads scanning surveillance activities at APHA in relation to pigs, to detect, investigate and tackle new and emerging disease threats and better understand existing porcine diseases."

The High Risk Area (15% of the coalfield area) is where coal mining risks are present at shallow depth which are likely to affect new development. The Low Risk Area (85% of the coalfield) is where past coal mining activity has taken place at sufficient depth that it poses low risk to new development Coal Mining Specific Risk Plan The Development High Risk Area (DHRA) contains 8 coal mining risks which make up the dark hatched high risk area. These specific risks are: Mine Entries with potential zone of influence Past Surface Hazards Past Shallow Coal Mine Workings Mine Gas Probable Shallow Coal Mine Workings Geological features (fissures and break lines) Workable Coal Seam Outcrops Surface (Opencast) Mining Surface Coal Resource Plan This plan illustrates the areas of Surface Coal Resources within each Local Planning Authority (LPA) administrative area.

These were imposed in conveyances by the National Coal Board or British Coal Corporation, examples of these clauses are: [InlineAttachment:1] [InlineAttachment:2] [InlineAttachment:3] Written approval will no longer be given and any interested party can rely upon the following: “In respect of any building or other works for which the Authority’s approval (as successor to the National Coal Board/British Coal) to plans and specifications is required in accordance with one of the examples, the Authority’s approval shall be deemed to have been given if: such building or other works are carried out and completed in accordance with the Building Regulations 2000 (if the building or other works are not subject to the Building Regulations 2000) such building or other works have been designed, carried out and completed in accordance with (insofar as the risk of mining subsidence can have been reasonably foreseen) the best available techniques not entailing excessive cost for minimising damage caused by subsidence” Any interested party can also rely on the above in circumstances where any work was carried out without the prior approval of the Authority/National Coal Board/British Coal. Sale of mining features There are a large number of conveyances or transfers which have clauses that relate to the sale of tips, shafts, drifts and adits. These often require buyers and lessees to perform the raft of covenants in the original sale document relevant to these features with either British Coal or the National Coal Board. As of the Coal Industry Act 1994 these covenants were passed to the Coal Authority through restructuring schemes. To comply with these clauses when completing a transfer or lease you can provide the Coal Authority with: Deed of Covenant in favour of the Coal Authority and certified copy of the transfer or lease This is as an alternative to joining the Coal Authority as a party to each transfer or lease, and for the Authority to be provided with a properly executed duplicate of them. The covenant in favour of the Coal Authority should be: “The [Transferee/Lessee] to the intent and so as to bind (so far as practicable) the [conveyed land] and any part or parts thereof respectively into whosesoever hands the same may come and to benefit and protect any mines and minerals in which the Coal Authority has any interest and which provide subjacent or lateral support for the [conveyed land] or any part or parts thereof hereby covenants with the Coal Authority that the Transferee will at all times hereafter perform and observe the restrictions and stipulations contained in [the Fourth Schedule to a Conveyance dated [here include the date and parties to the original sale by British Coal/National Coal Board/Coal Authority]]” Restrictions on the use of land Any other questions about titles to land and property which include covenants imposed by the Authority or its predecessors should be made in writing to the Head of Property.

The right to claim compensation for damage caused to the surface by lawful coal mining operations is now included in the Coal Mining (Subsidence) Act 1991 In a limited number of cases, land was sold by British Coal/National Coal Board subject to similar terms but purporting to exclude remedies which would otherwise be available under the 1957 Act. The land sold subject to such provisions was generally considered to be more susceptible to coal mining subsidence due to the presence of either mining features (mine shafts, drifts/adits) or due to known or suspected shallow coal workings. Land owners should take such matters into consideration prior to carrying out any works on such land. Mining leases The title deeds to your property may be subject to mining leases given to colliery companies prior to the Coal Industry Nationalisation Act of 1946. These leases allowed the companies to mine coal. The expression “coal” included not only bituminous coal, cannel coal and anthracite but also other minerals and substances if they were comprised in any such leases provided they were in existence as at 1 January 1939. Such Leases may now be the Coal Authority’s title to minerals. The policy set by the Coal Authority is to not release land from these mining leases. Further information If the Land Registry online service cannot provide you with relevant deeds or documents the Coal Authority can on request search its records. Please refer to our services information for prices and contact information.

/government/news/coal-authority-welcomes-triennial-reviews-findings,"The Coal Authority has welcomed the findings of a Triennial Review recommending that it continues to carry out its current functions. Coal Authority welcomes Triennial Review’s findings  Coal Authority The Coal Authority has today, 17 December 2014, welcomed the findings of a Triennial Review into its work by government, which has recommended that it should continue to carry out its current functions in its present form. The review takes place every three years to consider whether the Authority’s work is still relevant and needed today. Many individuals and organisations giving evidence to the Triennial Review said that the Authority’s work to clean up mine water pollution and deal with public safety and subsidence issues is vital. The Authority is now working to become more self-sufficient by developing its range of commercial products and services, whilst continuing to deliver its statutory duties in dealing with Britain’s mining legacy. It is also looking at ways to share its expertise in resolving the impacts of mining by providing advice and services to governments, public bodies and organisations in the UK and overseas. Stephen Dingle, Chair, Coal Authority, said: “In our five year plan we outlined our commitment to being a world leader in resolving the impacts of mining. The results of our Triennial Review are excellent and I am delighted that the work of our expert team has been recognised by government and our stakeholders. “We work hard to deliver products and services that are cost-effective, innovative and sustainable, offering our customers real, long-term solutions. Our engineers, scientists, mining surveyors and mining information experts work together every day to help deliver peace of mind for the people and organisations that we support. But we know that our practices and technology can be used to do even more to resolve the impacts of mining. That’s why we’re now using our expertise to deal with pollution from historic metal mining in the UK and expanding our work to support governments and organisations in the UK and overseas.” For updates on the Coal Authority’s work follow them on Twitter, LinkedIn or Facebook. ENDS NOTES FOR EDITORS Millions of home owners and buyers living in coalfield areas benefit from the coal mining reports service that the Authority provides, to report any potential hazards from past coal mining, such as nearby mine shafts and the potential for subsidence. The Coal Authority also manages 70 mine water treatment schemes across Britain, which help to restore rivers and lakes from pollution caused by former coal and metal mines and protect important sources of drinking water. Its experts advise local authorities and others on issues around land stability and public safety hazards, and run a mine entry inspection programme which has carried out over 100,000 unique inspections since 2008. Triennial Reviews are a Cabinet Office mandated process for reviewing the function of Non-Departmental Public Bodies, the appropriateness of the bodies’ delivery mechanisms and their governance arrangements. The Triennial Review has two stages: Stage 1 – considers if the functions of the Authority are still relevant and necessary, Stage 2 – considers the governance processes of the Authority, to see if they comply with all applicable statute, regulation and best practice. The Coal Authority’s work handling subsidence and safety associated with former coal mines is a statutory Duty under the Coal Industry Act 1994 and the Coal Mining Subsidence Act 1991. These Duties were established to protect the public and their property from the potential impacts of past coal mining.

Low and high risk development areas have been defined by the Coal Authority using their extensive mining records. Data on the Coal Authority’s Interactive Map Viewer represents a snap shot in time from the national coal mining database, which is regularly updated with new information on past and present coal mining. Louise Tipper, Information Manager, Coal Authority said: “Our updated Interactive Map Viewer uses a responsive design so it’s much easier to use on mobile devices. The new version also allows people to view the data on a full screen on their laptop or PC. Users can turn on selected data layers to allow them to see various coal mining data on top of the map. Clicking on any data points or areas will provide further detailed information. Users can easily check a particular location by either entering a postcode or zooming into the area they’d like to view.” The Interactive Map Viewer also includes INSPIRE compliant data for professional GIS users, enabling them to stream data directly to their own GIS."

Planning applications: coal mining risk assessments Property and development Coal Authority Coalfields are divided into high and low risk areas. A high risk area is where there are hazards that are likely to affect a new development. If your site is in a high risk area, you need to send a coal mining risk assessment to your local council, along with your planning application. The majority of coalfield areas are low risk, the high risk areas are a significantly smaller percentage. You do not need a coal mining risk assessment if your site is in a low risk area. Check if your site is in a high risk area To find out if your site is in a high risk area you can use the coalfield plans for your local council area that show high and low risk areas (shown by dark and light hatching) and identify specific hazards. The Coal Authority’s Interactive Map Viewer provides a high risk area option. Both the coalfield local council area maps and interactive map viewer data are updated annually from the Coal Authority Mining Records.

/government/news/coal-authority-to-take-on-kellingley-subsidence-claims,"The Coal Authority is preparing to take on Kellingley Colliery's coal mining subsidence claims.   Coal Authority to take on Kellingley subsidence claims  Coal Authority The Coal Authority has today confirmed that it is preparing to take on coal mining subsidence claims related to mining at Kellingley Colliery. The Authority already manages subsidence claims for the former Hatfield Colliery, which closed earlier in the year, and has managed claims for Daw Mill Colliery following its closure in 2013. It is now getting ready to manage potential subsidence claims from property owners in Yorkshire. Philip Lawrence, Chief Executive, Coal Authority, said: “The closure of Kellingley Colliery marks the end of an incredibly significant period in our country’s social and economic history. Many of our staff started their working lives in Britain’s coal mines – as miners, engineers, surveyors and other specialists – and they’re now managing the legacy that coal mining has left behind. “Whilst we have no liability for the Kellingley Colliery site, our team is preparing to take on the management of the subsidence claims from Kellingley and also Thoresby Colliery which closed earlier in the year. This work will add to our existing role of managing £1 billion of mining legacy responsibilities across Britain, including over 172,000 mine entries and 26,000km2 of underground workings, to protect the public and the environment.” The Coal Authority will be releasing further information in the New Year about how people can claim for coal mining subsidence connected to Kellingley Colliery. In the meantime, property owners are asked to continue to contact UK Coal directly. Additional information Managing Britain’s coal mining legacy 200 years of the coal industry in Britain"
/government/news/nantyffyllon-incident-update,"An update from the Coal Authority on the incident reported today in Nantyffyllon, south Wales. Nantyffyllon incident update  Coal Authority On Thursday, 31 December 2015, we received a report of a hole that had appeared in a pavement in Nantyffyllon. Our regional team responded quickly and visited the site to carry out an initial assessment of the collapse, which was measured at 3 metres by 3.2 metres and 4 metres deep. The collapse goes up to the edge of a residential building and extends slightly underneath the road. Our initial site and desktop investigations have indicated that the collapse is unlikely to be coal mining related. However, we are continuing to work closely with the council while they carry out further physical investigation works. If these investigations reveal that the cause was due to unrecorded historical coal mine workings we will undertake repair works as required.

/government/news/coal-authority-scheme-to-protect-important-drinking-water-source,"A new protection scheme at Whitburn will prevent an important drinking water source from contamination by mine water.  Coal Authority scheme to protect important drinking water source  Coal Authority A new protection scheme developed by the Coal Authority has been switched on at Whitburn to prevent an important drinking water source from contamination by mine water. The scheme will stop mine water from entering the limestone rocks beneath the surface, which hold the drinking water source for thousands of homes and businesses in South Tyneside and Sunderland. Mine water is water which has made its way into old mine workings and has picked up naturally occurring minerals from the rocks, mainly salt and iron. Since coal mining came to an end in the area in the 1990s mine water has been rising up slowly through the old mine workings. The new scheme has been designed to have minimal visual impact and will pump the mine water from the abandoned workings deep beneath Whitburn Coastal Park, controlling it at around 50 metres below ground. It will then be transported 230 metres out to sea, beyond the low-tide level, where it will be dispersed by natural processes. The new scheme is part of a wider programme of protection schemes which the Coal Authority is developing and operating throughout the region to address the impacts of rising mine water from historical coal mining. Tracey Davies, Head of Environment, Coal Authority, said: “The protection scheme is the latest of three schemes that we have developed locally to prevent the contamination of this important drinking water source. The implementation of the new scheme follows successful trials at Whitburn to manage the rise in mine water levels from within the old coal mine workings. “We have undertaken specialist studies to model the impact of the mine water discharge and taken specialist environmental advice to ensure the scheme meets the relevant quality standards. We will continue to work with the Environment Agency to monitor the scheme and ensure these standards continue to be met to protect the marine environment.” Read more information about the Whitburn aquifer protection scheme. What is mine water? When coal mines are operational water is pumped from underground workings to keep them dry so that the coal can be mined. Historically, when the mines closed these pumps were turned off and the abandoned workings then filled up with water. Water makes its way into old mine workings and picks up naturally occurring minerals, mainly salt and iron, from the rocks. This is called mine water. Left unmanaged this water can make its way into overlying aquifers, which leads to the contamination of important sources of drinking water. The Coal Authority has built schemes across Britain to manage mine water and protect several regionally important aquifers from the impacts of historical coal mining. ENDS"
/government/news/coal-authority-makes-multi-million-pound-awards-to-protect-nations-environment,"The Coal Authority has made two new awards to operate and maintain its treatment schemes and to design and construct new schemes. Coal Authority makes multi-million pound awards to protect nation’s environment Mine water management Coal Authority The Coal Authority has made two new multi-million pound awards to protect the nation’s environment from polluted water from disused coal and metal mines. Severn Trent Services has been awarded a 10-year contract worth a minimum of £25 million with a likely overall contract spend in excess of £50 million. They will operate and maintain the Authority’s 82 mine water treatment schemes, pumping stations and mine gas facilities in Britain, plus new schemes to be built in the future. Civil engineering firm JN Bentley has been awarded a 4-year framework agreement with an expected value of between £2.5 million to around £4 million a year, to design and construct new mine water treatment schemes. The three organisations will be working together using a new partnership approach, which will focus on continuous improvement through the design of innovative and sustainable solutions. Partnership working will take place from concept through to the construction and operation of each mine water treatment scheme. The Authority’s existing schemes prevent over 4,000 tonnes of iron solids from entering Britain’s watercourses every year. They also protect a number of the nation’s drinking water aquifers from pollution from rising mine waters. The Authority recently built its first mine water treatment schemes to address pollution from metal mines, at Force Crag in the Lake District and at Saltburn Gill in North Yorkshire. Speaking at the official contract signing, Simon Reed, Chief Operating Officer, Coal Authority said: “The procurement process has been extremely competitive and we received many high quality proposals. We are delighted to announce that we will be combining our expertise with that of Severn Trent Services and JN Bentley to continue to resolve the impacts of mining on the environment. Our programmes for addressing water pollution from both coal and metal mines will be enhanced as we work together to deliver innovation and schemes with strong economic and environmental benefits.” For more information or to arrange an interview please contact: John Delaney, Corporate Manager, Coal Authority, by telephone 01623 637250 or email johndelaney@coal.gov.uk"
/government/news/minister-opens-force-crag-metal-mine-water-treatment-scheme,"An innovative treatment works using the natural environment to clean metal-rich water from an abandoned mine was recently opened by Water Minister Rory Stewart in Cumbria. Minister opens Force Crag metal mine water treatment scheme Mine water management Coal Authority Set in the Cumbrian hills near Keswick, the Force Crag mine water treatment scheme will clean up a 6 mile stretch of river, preventing up to a tonne of metals, including zinc, cadmium and lead, from entering Bassenthwaite Lake each year. The scheme has been carefully designed to be consistent with the beautiful surroundings and address this major source of metal pollution. We are delighted with its excellent performance in removing in excess of 95% of the metals from the mine water. Funded by Defra, the scheme is part of the Government’s £8.5 million investment in low-cost solutions to tackle water pollution caused by abandoned metal mines that pollute over 1000 miles of rivers in England. The concept was developed by Dr Adam Jarvis and his team at Newcastle University and delivered by the Coal Authority in partnership with the Environment Agency, the National Trust, the Lake District National Park Authority and others. The Force Crag Mine was worked for zinc, lead and barytes from 1835 until 1991 and was the last working mine in the Lake District. Read the press release about the official opening of the scheme.

/government/news/big-step-towards-cleaning-up-the-saltburn-gill,"The Coal Authority working in close partnership with the Saltburn Gill Action Group and the Environment Agency has successfully halted the worst of three flows of polluted water from the abandoned ironstone mines of East Cleveland. Big step towards cleaning up the Saltburn Gill Mine water management Coal Authority Mine water has flowed from old mine workings to the south of Saltburn since 1999, causing severe pollution of the Saltburn Gill and Skelton Beck. The unsightly orange stream has not gone unnoticed by the local residents as it flows over the beach and into the North Sea. The Saltburn Gill Action Group was set up by concerned local residents with help from the Environment Agency to raise the profile of the problem, and the Authority became involved initially in an advisory capacity in 2008 to guide the group through a feasibility study. During the summer of 2013, the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra) funded the Coal Authority to pump water from the mines to halt the polluting outflows. This water is partially cleaned up as it passes through the first stage of a treatment scheme built by the Coal Authority. Due to the Coal Authority treatment scheme, the worst of the polluting flows has been halted. It will continue to pump in order to dry up all the mine water pollution. In 2014, a large wetland will be added to the treatment scheme to remove iron from the water using natural processes before the treated water is returned to the Gill. These reed beds will provide both filtration of the mine water to remove iron particles and a new environment for wildlife in the area, and will restore the Gill into a place where nature can thrive once again."
/government/news/update-on-the-proposed-nent-haggs-mine-water-treatment-scheme,"An update on the proposed Nent Haggs mine water treatment scheme. Update on the proposed Nent Haggs mine water treatment scheme  Coal Authority Background Historical metal mining has left a legacy of pollution which is severely damaging the aquatic life in the River Nent. The River Nent is the worst polluted river in the region and the second worst in England for pollution from abandoned metal mines. The proposed Nent Haggs mine water treatment scheme would use natural processes to remove lead, zinc and cadmium from the mine water before it enters the river. By removing the metals the scheme will help to restore life to the river – improving the water quality and biodiversity. The proposed scheme is similar to Force Crag mine water treatment scheme, which we’re already operating in the Lake District National Park. This scheme is successfully removing between 94% and 98% of the same metals from the mine water, improving the River Derwent and Bassenthwaite Lake Special Area of Conservation. Site selection We have worked with the Environment Agency to undertake a detailed site selection process for the proposed scheme, which considered possible locations up to 1.5 km from the Haggs Mine and within 500 metres of the River Nent. Potential sites were assessed against a range of factors including landscaping, size, sustainability, engineering and environmental criteria. The Nentsberry site was selected because it was ranked the most suitable of all the options. Proposed scheme The proposed mine water treatment scheme has been designed to avoid or minimise as many adverse environmental effects as possible. A key environmental consideration was how the proposed scheme could be designed to fit more naturally within the local setting and its location within the Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). As a result of the consultations, the proposed mine water treatment ponds have been designed to look like natural water features within the valley. A Landscape and Ecology Management Plan has been prepared for the proposed scheme that outlines the landscaping works proposed within the main site. The soft landscaping proposals will mitigate the landscape and visual effects of the proposed scheme and will enhance the habitats and biodiversity of the area. We are continuing to take advice from the North Pennines Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty Partnership about how the proposed scheme fits into the landscape, and from the Environment Agency to ensure the scheme meets all the relevant environmental requirements. Community engagement As the project has progressed - from initial scoping and feasibility, through to outline design - we have liaised with the local community and other stakeholders, providing information and updates as these have become available. We are committed to continuing to work with the local community to develop the project and to answer any questions. To obtain feedback on the initial outline design, we sent questionnaires to local residents to seek views on the proposed scheme. The results from the survey showed that: 71% of respondents supported the principle of the proposed mine water treatment scheme 76% agreed that the design is appropriate for the proposed location We also included several suggestions for wildlife habitat areas and footpaths. Community information event At the community information event in February 2016 we met residents, councillors and other stakeholders, provided detailed information about the proposals, listened to comments and answered questions. Since this event we have modified the proposed design and responded to individual enquiries. To ensure that people had continued access to the information, the display boards about the proposed scheme have been on public view at Alston Town Hall since the community information event. Further formal feedback on comments and questions raised at the event will be provided in April 2016 through attendance at the Alston Moor Parish Council meeting and on our website . Planning application We are aiming to submit the planning application for the proposed scheme to Cumbria County Council in Summer 2016. The planning application with supporting technical documents and drawings will be available to review at Alston Town Hall, at the Nent Hall Hotel and at Cumbria County Council’s Planning Office in Kendal. Odour Some residents have raised concerns about the potential for odour from the scheme. Our experts and technical advisors are currently finalising details of an odour abatement plan to address the potential issues. This will form part of our planning application. Details of this plan will be made publicly available when finalised.

/government/news/clevelands-economy-to-be-boosted-by-cleaner-water,"A mine water treatment scheme is helping to improve the bathing water quality at Saltburn-by-the-Sea in the north east of England.   Cleveland’s economy to be boosted by cleaner water  Coal Authority The local economy of Redcar and Cleveland is set to benefit after a new mine water treatment scheme becomes operational to improve the bathing water quality of the area. The Coal Authority has calculated that stopping iron entering water at Saltburn, which then flows into the North Sea, has the potential to add £10.5 million into the local economy over the next 25 years. Stephen Dingle, Chair of the Coal Authority, said: “This water treatment scheme has been carefully designed by our experts to address the pollution problems caused by historical mining operations. “We are delighted with the excellent performance of the system, as it removes in excess of 98% of metals from the mine water before it is put back into the local waterways.” Graeme Warren, the Environment Agency’s Area Manager for the North East, said: “In 1999 a large mine water outbreak occurred which flowed into Saltburn Gill, quickly turning the stream a bright orange colour. “This severely impacted the fish and river insects and smothered the stream bed in Saltburn Gill and Skelton Beck but it also affected the bathing water quality on the beach. “We’re really pleased that this new treatment scheme supports the objectives of the Northumbria River Basin Management Plan to return the watercourses to a high standard, improving both the biodiversity of the area and the water quality of one of the most popular surfing beaches along the east coast.” The area of East Cleveland saw large-scale deep mining for well over 100 years. When local ironstone mining operations stopped in the 1960s, the pumps that removed water from the mines were turned off and removed. Water made its way into the old mine workings and eventually reached the surface allowing the iron to enter the streams where it settled out as a sludge called iron ochre. Although not harmful to people, the iron ochre caused severe pollution to both streams, discoloured the beach and sometimes caused an orange plume to form in the North Sea. Tom Blenkinsop, MP for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland, said: “This work has finally seen success in clearing up this watercourse from this unsightly reminder of our mining past. “It will help boost our local economy by making Saltburn the jewel in the crown of East Cleveland’s seaside, benefiting both tourists and local businesses. Adding in that this brings back wildlife to Saltburn Gill and Skelton Beck, allowing us to see riverside plants, animals and fish flourish again, makes it the ultimate win-win.” Environment Minister Rory Stewart, said: “Thanks to Defra funding the construction of this scheme, the rivers of Saltburn are thriving and the water is running clear once more. “It is fantastic to see fish like the brown trout and European bullhead returning here again and it’s not just the environment that’s benefitting - this is a boost for the local economy and the community, who have their waters back.” Jim Wingham, Saltburn Gill Action Group Chairman said: ‘“We’re proud of the fact that we helped to provide the solution to ridding our community of this serious pollution and of the way that many organisations worked together to achieve our goal.” The action group worked with the Environment Agency to gain funding to investigate options to clean up the pollution and together they secured the necessary funding from the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to address the issue for the local community. Stephen Dingle added: “Following initial work, we were asked to develop and build the mine water treatment scheme because of our expertise in treating water at historical mining sites. “The treatment scheme works by using four lagoons, with cascades and a drying bed, to remove the iron from the raw mine water. “The mine water is pumped to the top of aeration cascades and over a period of two days it flows down through each settlement lagoon where the majority of the iron settles. “The sludge is then transferred through underground pipes from the bottom of the lagoons through into the drying bed where it is collected and removed. The treated water then passes through a polishing reed bed that acts as a further filter. Graeme Warren added: “We’re delighted to be involved in this Saltburn scheme, which is the culmination of many years of hard work, together with our partners and the community, to make vast improvements to the water quality in the area. “Our bathing waters are better now than they’ve ever been and we’re committed to maintaining what we’ve achieved so far and further improving water quality and biodiversity right across our waters. Schemes like this will help us move forward to create even more effective and sustainable mine water treatment schemes elsewhere in England.”"

This information is used by solicitors, search providers and members of the public. Get historic digital coal mining data Coal abandonment plans You may need to access historic mine plans for research purposes, for desktop studies prior to development or if you simply have an interest in the history of mining. The mining records office houses a collection of coal abandonment plans, covering both opencast and deep mining operations, which depict areas of coal extraction and the point of entry into the same. All plans have been digitally scanned and are available to any interested parties. Digital or paper copies of abandonment plans can be ordered by submitting your site plan and request to thecoalauthority@coal.gov.uk British Coal photograph collection If you are interested in coal mining history we have a large collection of old British Coal photographs. These photos are from a wide range of collieries covering every aspect of coal mining. These have all been scanned, are searchable and are available in the Mining Heritage Centre to view digitally. Digital or paper prints of photos can be ordered by submitting your order request to thecoalauthority@coal.gov.uk If you would prefer to view the plans or photos on our bespoke viewing system at the Mansfield office then please call the Mining Heritage Centre on 01623 637235 to arrange an appointment Get historic paper coal mining records Coal holdings register ( CHR ) If you need to research mines/minerals ownership for a particular area/site then you will need to look at the CHR . This is a paper archive held at the Mining Heritage Centre. The CHR dealt with the transfer in ownership of coal and other minerals prior to the Nationalisation of the Coal Industry. Any investigation into the title to mines/minerals in a coal mining area must involve an inspection of the CHR . The Coal Authority will not regard the investigation as being done properly without this being carried out. To search the CHR you will need to provide a plan of your area of interest along with your request for a search to thecoalauthority@coal.gov.uk Licence register If you need details on a coal mining licence then you will need to refer to the Coal Authority’s licence register. This holds details of all current granted coal mining licences (underground, opencast and underground coal gasification) and also any current applications. These are usually requested by homeowners if they receive a mining report that mentions a particular licence. An entry in the licence register provides you with details of the licensee and a plan of the area affected. If you would like a copy of an entry from the licence register then you will need to submit your request, naming the licence you are interested in, to thecoalauthority@coal.gov.uk Property deeds and documents In the first instance all enquiries should be directed to the Land Registry If your title deeds to a residential property have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Authority may be able to provide certified copies.

Barneycraig mine water treatment scheme Mine water management Coal Authority The Coal Authority is working with the Environment Agency to clean up pollution from abandoned mines. Metal Pollution Due to the historical mining heritage in the area, local rivers are being polluted by metal-rich water from adit discharges and spoil heap run off. To address the pollution and improve the water quality within the local watercourses, we are proposing to construct a mine water treatment scheme The River West Allen is the sixth (equal) worst metal polluted river in England. As a consequence, the river life is severely damaged by the metals in the water. The river contains lead, zinc and cadmium which are contributing to pollution in the River South Tyne, up to 40km downstream. Documents "

Caplecleugh and Rampgill mine water treatment scheme Mine water management Coal Authority The River Nent is the second worst metal polluted river in England. The discharge from the Caplecleugh Level is one the most significant sources of metal mine pollution into the River Nent, with the Rampgill Level also causing pollution. The Haggs Level is another significant source. In addition, the Nent Force Level discharges into the River Nent in Alston As a consequence of this and other sources of pollution, the aquatic life in the River Nent is severely damaged by the high metal concentrations. To address the pollution, we are developing a proposal to build a mine water treatment scheme to clean the polluted water discharging from the Caplecleugh and Rampgill Levels in Nenthead before it reaches the River Nent. This will improve the water quality within the watercourse and improve the environment for wildlife and people.

/government/collections/metal-mine-water-treatment,"The Water and Abandoned Metal Mines programme aims to tackle the water pollution caused by historic metal mining. Metal mine water treatment  Coal Authority Metal mines played a major part in Britain’s history, but abandoned mines now pollute our rivers, harm aquatic life and have an adverse impact on tourism. In England, this metal mine pollution affects around 1,500km of rivers. Today, mine operators have to comply with all current legislation; meaning they cannot allow mine water to pollute rivers, streams, lakes or groundwater. They’re also responsible for the costs of cleaning up any pollution that occurs once mining operations have ceased. However, most mines were abandoned many decades ago, before the current laws came into place. Historic metal mining legacies Until 31 December 1999, mine operators could abandon a mine without notifying anyone and disregard any responsibility for allowing contaminated water to enter into waterways. The operators could be found guilty of causing pollution, but due to the complexities of historic mining, underground connections and mine ownership, it was difficult to prove that the act of abandoning a mine caused the pollution. That is why the government set up the Water and Abandoned Metal Mines programme, providing funds to the Coal Authority and the Environment Agency to clean up pollution caused by historic metal mining. Water and Abandoned Metal Mines programme The Water and Abandoned Metal Mines programme will target the most heavily impacted watercourses. The first scheme in this programme was developed at Force Crag in the Lake District National Park and has been operational since 2014. Our aim is to achieve: cleaner rivers for current and future generations more wildlife for people to enjoy more tourism and opportunities for industry which rely on clean rivers writing the next chapter in the mining story Proposed metal mine water treatment schemes Areas affected by historic metal mining Northumbria river basin Abandoned metal mines affect up to 9% of waterbodies in this district, equalling up to 350km of watercourse. Investigations are underway or planned for most of the rivers affected by metal mines. One mine water treatment scheme has been completed at Saltburn Gill and the feasibility of building measures that provide environmental and economic benefits will be investigated during the second River Basin Management Planning Cycle: 2015 to 2021. See all the Northumbrian river basin documents . North West river basin Abandoned metal mines affect up to 3% of waterbodies in this district, equalling up to 130km of watercourse. Investigations are underway or planned for most of the rivers affected by metal mines. One mine water treatment scheme has been completed at Force Crag in the Lake District. This was the UK’s first passive treatment scheme for an abandoned metal mine and began operating in March 2014. The feasibility of building measures that provide environmental and economic benefits will be investigated during the second River Basin Management Planning Cycle: 2015 to 2021. See all the North West river basin documents . Humber river basin Abandoned metal mines affect up to 520km of watercourse in this area. Investigations are underway or planned for most of the rivers affected by metal mines. The feasibility of building measures that provide environmental and economic benefits will be investigated during the second River Basin Management Planning Cycle: 2015 to 2021, particularly in the Swale and Nidd catchments. See all the Humber river basin documents . Solway Tweed river basin Although pollution from abandoned metal mines is not a significant water management issue across the Solway Tweed river basin district as a whole, in places it is an important local issue. Abandoned metal mines pollute about 60km of watercourse in this area and investigations are planned for most of these rivers. See all the Solway Tweed river basin documents . Severn river basin Although pollution from abandoned metal mines is not a significant water management issue across the River Severn river basin district, in places it is an important local issue. Up to 79km of watercourse is affected by pollution and investigations are underway or planned for most of the rivers affected by metal mines. The feasibility of building measures that provide environmental and economic benefits will be investigated during the second River Basin Management Planning Cycle: 2015 to 2021. See all the Severn river basin documents . South West river basin Abandoned metal mines affect up to 5% of waterbodies in this district. Up to 450km of watercourse suffers from pollution and investigations are underway or planned for most of the rivers affected by historic metal mining. An existing measure to deal with pollution from metal mines is at the former Wheal Jane tin mine. This was implemented after an uncontrolled release of an estimated 50,000m3 of acidic metal-rich water over a 24 hour period in 1992, which caused significant pollution of the Carnon River and Fal Estuary. The feasibility of building measures that provide environmental and economic benefits will be investigated during the second River Basin Management Planning Cycle: 2015 to 2021.

Rabies control strategy  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Summary This consultation sought views on Defra’s recently revised and published draft Rabies Control Strategy , which sets out a framework for how an incident or outbreak of rabies in England and/or Wales would be managed. The Control Strategy describes the general control options that have been identified for the most likely scenarios for cases of classical rabies virus and the rationale for such controls. In general we have avoided prescribing exactly how and when individual controls should be applied as we need to retain the necessary flexibility so that each situation can be dealt with on a case-by-case basis appropriate to the particular circumstances.  We do however want to understand in a bit more detail the practicalities of the control options as there may be some scope in clarifying the circumstances under which they are more likely to be used, less likely or indeed ruled out altogether. We specifically sought views on the use of control options though we welcomed general comments on all aspects of the document."

/government/speeches/richard-benyon-speech-natural-history-museum,"Launching a unique collection of wildlife images from species found within our Overseas Territories. Richard Benyon speech – Natural History Museum  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs A recent article by Mike McCarthy the Environment Editor at the Independent newspaper questioned the use of the term biodiversity. He felt it was a pompous way of saying wildlife. He thought it created a gap between policymakers and the public.  If you stop to think about it - how many people do you know say I love watching biodiversity documentaries on the television. They are more likely to say I love watching wildlife films on the TV. But as Mike said it’s the currency in use in the policymaking debate about the future of the natural world and as such should be embraced if people want to engage in the discussion. Though despite this some of the messages must be getting through because in his article Mike also talked about the fact that conservation efforts are increasing around the world. As part of that effort I’m pleased to announce the launch of a unique collection of wildlife images from species found within our Overseas Territories. The collection will eventually consist of over 200 audio visual profiles that will be available online and on a free DVD for use by people around the world. This is a joint effort backed by Defra/DFID and the Foreign Office and put together by Wildscreen as part of their ARKive project.  I understand ARKive have a stand here today so if you can go along and take a look at some of the fantastic imagery on display. This launch is particularly significant because many of the species and habitats found within our Overseas Territories are found nowhere else in the world. As such they underpin the lives of many local people through fishing and tourism which in turn develops further the economic and social fabric of communities in the Territories. Emperor penguins are a charismatic and much-loved component of the wildlife in many of the Territories, especially in the South Atlantic, and attract tourism and consequently valuable revenue. Indeed other seabirds, both common to the Territories and found elsewhere, attract people to some of the least affluent of the Territories, such as Ascension Island, the home to the Ascension Frigatebird, and Tristan da Cunha with its Tristan Albatross. On the wider stage we are all gearing up for Nagoya later this month. It’s the showpiece event for the International Year of Biodiversity. It’s important that in Japan we look to set the framework for conservation post 2010. It’s important we learn from our experience since Johannesburg 2002.  Important we recognise that the international community collectively failed to meet the targets set in South Africa. We now need to focus activity on new ambitions and make sure the UK takes a leading role in this work. So how will this take shape? We need the international community to recognise that we are all in this together. And as such we all need to secure an agreement on ambitious and realistic action post 2010. Above all it’s important everyone understands that biodiversity is not seen as a side issue  - as an after-thought or  ’a nice to have’. It is fundamental to our survival. We must take action to conserve it. Thank you."

/guidance/removing-abandoned-shopping-trolleys-council-powers,"How councils can deal with abandoned shopping and luggage trolleys, including who to consult, disposal and claiming costs.  Removing abandoned shopping trolleys: council powers  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs If you’re a council, you can generally remove shopping and luggage trolleys abandoned on land or waterway in the open air. This doesn’t apply to power-assisted trolleys. Land you can’t remove trolleys from You can’t remove trolleys if any of the following apply to the land: it’s owned by the trolley owner it’s used for trolley storage it’s used for transport where luggage trolleys are provided it’s used for off-street parking and there are facilities for shoppers to leave their trolleys in the parking area Removing trolleys from water You should use specialist contractors and liaise with the Environment Agency to remove trolleys from rivers and waterways. You should contact the Canals and Rivers Trust about trolleys found in their inland waterways. Removing trolleys from private land You must ask permission from landowners or occupiers before removing trolleys from private land. If they don’t give you permission, you can serve a notice stating that you intend to remove the trolley. If no objection is received, you can remove the trolley 14 days after notice is served. Contacting trolley owners If you can identify trolley owners, you must give them notice to claim any trolleys you’ve removed. This notice must state all of the following: that you’ve removed the trolley and are keeping it where you’re keeping it that you may dispose of the trolley if they don’t claim it You must deliver the trolley to its owner if they claim it and they pay all costs within 6 weeks. If the owner doesn’t pay, you don’t have to return the trolley. Disposing of trolleys You must keep trolleys for 6 weeks after removing them. If you’ve tried to find the owner and they’ve not claimed the trolleys in this time, you can sell or dispose of them. Claiming costs You can claim the costs of removal, storage and disposal from trolley owners. You must review your charges each year to make sure they cover these costs. Trolley collection schemes You can agree a scheme with business owners in your area to make sure they collect their trolleys. You can’t claim any costs associated with removing, storing or disposing of trolleys if the trolley owners are part of such a scheme. Before you start removing trolleys Before you start removing trolleys, you must: consult people affected (or their representatives) formally adopt the powers leave at least 3 months between making the decision to adopt the powers to remove abandoned trolleys and those powers coming into effect announce in at least 1 local newspaper that you will now be removing abandoned trolleys, once the powers have come into effect You must then consult the people affected from time to time about how you’re using the powers. You can end your powers to remove abandoned trolleys at any time. Who you need to consult You must consult people who’ll be affected before you start removing trolleys and from time to time. This usually includes: local retailers who offer trolleys representative bodies, for example, the British Retail Consortium, the Association of Town Centre Management and the Association of Convenience Stores local residents rail, tram, road transport or airport operators who provide trolleys local police the Environment Agency"
/guidance/council-powers-to-control-leafleting-causing-a-litter-problem,"How councils can control leafleting which is causing a litter problem, the places and leaflets that are exempt and the fees they can charge. Council powers to control leafleting causing a litter problem  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs If you’re a district or county council, you can restrict the distribution of flyers, pamphlets, stickers, cards or other leaflets if they’re causing a litter problem. Unless their leaflet is exempt, individuals or groups who want to leaflet in these restricted areas must then apply to you to get permission. You can apply this restriction to any land you’re responsible for keeping clear of litter and refuse (‘relevant land’). Restrictions also apply to leafleting from vehicles in that area. These restrictions don’t apply to posters and other fixed advertising . Places where you can’t restrict leafleting You can’t restrict leafleting: on private land or premises, eg flyers handed out at a venue on public transport, eg leaflets left in stands on buses through letterboxes in newspapers or other publications Exempt leaflets Freedom of speech is important. You can’t ask people to apply for permission or restrict the distribution of leaflets that are: by or on behalf of a charity (if the leaflet is intended to benefit the charity) for the purposes of a religion or belief for political purposes Giving out offensive material can be a criminal offence (for example, stirring up racial hatred). If you think someone is committing an offence you should consider reporting it to the police. Before you restrict leafleting Consider the cause of the problem. Your approach must be in proportion to the litter problem. Before restricting leafleting in an area, find out: whether the litter is from one promoter or several whether the leaflet is designed to make a profit for anyone whether the distributor is a marketing company or an individual or community group You may want to treat leaflets promoting community or small-scale cultural or music events differently from leaflets that promote commercial or for-profit events as any restrictions can have a greater impact on small or voluntary groups. You should make sure any restrictions are consistent with how you apply other legislation. For example, if an event doesn’t need an entertainment licence you should consider whether it’s appropriate to require permission to distribute leaflets about it. Voluntary schemes Try to work with the community and set up a voluntary scheme before imposing restrictions. A voluntary scheme could ask distributors to agree to: stand near bins when handing out leaflets pick up any stray leaflets when they have finished only give leaflets to people who want them include an anti-littering message on their leaflets You could also offer to help to promote events in other ways so that fewer leaflets are necessary, for example by promoting events online, in council buildings or in your newsletter. Restrict leafleting If voluntary schemes don’t work, you must take certain steps before you can restrict the distribution of leaflets in an area: Collect evidence showing that leaflet litter is a problem in the area (you may need to prove that any restrictions are in proportion to the problem - it’s unlikely you’d need to restrict leafleting across a whole local authority or city). Publish notice of your plans in at least one local newspaper and on the land affected, including: a map of the area affected when the restriction begins (this must be at least 28 days after the notice is published) how people can comment and when they need to do this by (you must allow 14 days for comment after the notice is published) Consider comments and objections and record your reasons if you reject them. Publish when you’ll start to restrict leafleting at least 14 days in advance on the land and in at least one local newspaper. You should also publish this information on your website. Once restrictions are in place, publish information on: the areas that are restricted how to apply for permission to leaflet how long it takes to process an application fees exemptions any ‘general consents’ that are in place - eg if you have given permission for ‘any leafleting that promotes live entertainment in a small venue’ when you don’t need permission Allowing leaflet distribution in restricted areas Unless their leaflet is exempt, people wanting to leaflet in a restricted area must apply to you to for permission. You can give permission to: the person applying someone leafleting on the applicant’s behalf (applicants are responsible for making sure they comply with rules) specific employees in a company or members of a group groups (for example, all performers in a festival or all events at the same venue) You should write back to applicants and tell them whether or not you’ve given them permission, conditions that apply and any fees. Fees You can charge applicants a fee. You should make it clear what the fees are, for example, by publishing them on your website. Total fees over the year must be limited to covering all reasonable costs associated with operating and enforcing the restriction, including: the area survey administering applications notification procedures monitoring and enforcement of restrictions You can’t use the fees to cover cleaning costs. Your fees should be structured so that distributors only pay for what they need. You can reduce or remove fees altogether, for example you may decide to waive fees for distributing a small number of leaflets, or for leaflets advertising small-scale community or cultural events. Allowing leafleting with limits or conditions If you give a leaflet distributor written permission you must explain any limitations or conditions that apply to protect the area from litter. For example, you can limit: where you’re allowing them to leaflet (you can limit the area, ask them to stand near bins or specify other reasonable limitations) the times of day or night you’re allowing them to leaflet at how many leaflets you’re allowing them to give out the type of leaflet you’re allowing them to give out (you can include conditions relating to the format and the content) You can also impose conditions, including requiring them to: collect any leaflets that have been dropped when they’ve finished show that they have consent to leaflet when asked by an authorised officer If you change the permission conditions, you must tell any affected distributors. Refusing or revoking permission to leaflet You can refuse permission to leaflet if it’s likely to lead to littering. You can refuse permission if the applicant has been convicted or fined for a leafleting offence in the last 5 years. You can revoke permission if the applicant: doesn’t comply with conditions has been convicted or fined for distributing leaflets without permission You must tell the distributor if you plan to revoke an existing permission to give out leaflets. Appeals Applicants can appeal to a magistrates’ court if you: refuse permission to leaflet impose limits or conditions revoke their existing permission Penalties If people knowingly distribute leaflets or ask someone to deliver leaflets in a restricted area without permission, you can do one of the following: issue a fixed penalty notice of £50 to £80 (the default fine is £75) prosecute them in court (they can be fined up to £2,500) You can also seize leaflets. You must keep these until legal proceedings are complete or dropped as you’ll need to return them. You can only dispose of seized leaflets if any of the following apply: you don’t know who the owner is you don’t know where they are the court gives you permission Ending the need for permission to leaflet You should remove the requirement to get permission to leaflet if the restriction isn’t having the desired effect or is no longer necessary. If you decide to do this you must publish a notice in at least one local newspaper and in the places where the restrictions applied. You should also publish this information on your website."

/guidance/noise-nuisances-how-councils-deal-with-complaints,"How councils deal with complaints about noise at night, intruder alarms, construction noise and loudspeakers in the street.    Noise nuisances: how councils deal with complaints  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Councils must look into complaints about noise that could be a ‘statutory nuisance’ (covered by the Environmental Protection Act 1990 ). For the noise to count as a statutory nuisance it must do one of the following: unreasonably and substantially interfere with the use or enjoyment of a home or other premises injure health or be likely to injure health If they agree that a statutory nuisance is happening or will happen in the future, councils must serve an abatement notice . This requires whoever’s responsible to stop or restrict the noise. The notice will usually be served on the person responsible but can also be served on the owner or occupier of the premises. The abatement notice can be delayed for up to 7 days while the council tries to get the person responsible to stop or restrict the noise. Councils are responsible for looking into complaints about noise from: premises including land like gardens and certain vessels (for example, loud music or barking dogs) vehicles, machinery or equipment in the street (for example, music from car stereos) Statutory noise nuisance laws don’t apply to noise from: traffic or planes (they do apply to model planes) political demonstrations and demonstrations about a cause premises occupied by the armed forces or visiting forces Councils can decide what level of service they provide to deal with noise complaints, for example, whether to have officers on call at night. Noise at night: warning notices To deal with complaints about noise that’s louder than a permitted level at night (from 11pm to 7am) councils can issue a warning notice. They can issue warning notices for noise at night without it being a statutory nuisance. The warning notice must tell the recipient: that the noise is coming from the premises between 11pm and 7am that the noise exceeds, or may exceed permitted levels as measured from within the complainant’s dwelling that the noise must be reduced to below the permitted level in a specified period (this must be at least 10 minutes after the notice is served and must end by 7am) what time the notice is issued Noise from dwellings If the noise comes from a dwelling the notice must say that the person responsible may be guilty of an offence if noise exceeding permitted levels is made in the period specified. Noise from other premises If the noise comes from other premises (not a dwelling), the notice must say that the person responsible for the premises may be guilty of an offence if noise exceeding permitted levels is made in the period specified. If noise isn’t reduced If the council thinks the noise still exceeds the permitted level after the specified period and wants to prosecute, they must measure the noise level from within the dwelling of the person who’s complained. Permitted noise levels The permitted noise level using A-weighted decibels (the unit environmental noise is usually measured in) is: 34 dBA (decibels adjusted) if the underlying level of noise is no more than 24 dBA 10 dBA above the underlying level of noise if this is more than 24 dBA Penalties for not complying with a warning notice If someone doesn’t comply with a warning notice without a reasonable excuse, councils can: give a fixed penalty notice ( FPN ) giving them the chance to pay a fine (up to £110 for dwellings and £500 for licensed premises) within 14 days, instead of being prosecuted prosecute them if they don’t issue an FPN or if the person responsible doesn’t pay the fine on time (if convicted they can get a fine of up to £1,000 for dwellings and an unlimited amount for licensed premises) remove noise-making equipment like loudspeakers Noise from intruder alarms To deal with noise caused by problems with intruder alarms, councils can issue both: an abatement notice requiring the noise to stop (councils must do this if the alarm is causing a statutory nuisance) a warning notice (for noise between 11pm to 7am) Alarm notification areas In alarm notification areas, owners or occupiers with an alarm must give the council details of a key holder who can enter the property and turn off the alarm. To set up an alarm notification area councils must: Advertise the proposed notification area in a local newspaper or newsletter, allowing at least 28 days for comments. Review comments. Notify all premises in the affected area, highlighting the date the notification area starts (which must be at least 28 days from the notification date), by: letter advertising in a local newspaper If the occupier or owner fails to give the council details of a key holder, the council can do one of the following: issue a fixed penalty notice giving them the chance to pay a fine of between £50 and £80 (the default amount is £75) as an alternative to being prosecuted prosecute them if they don’t issue an FPN or if the person responsible doesn’t pay the fine on time (if convicted, they can be fined up to £1,000) What councils can do if they can’t reach a key holder If councils can’t reach a key holder they can enter properties without force to silence alarms if all the following apply: they’ve taken reasonable steps to contact the key holder to silence the alarm the alarm has been going off constantly for 20 minutes or 1 hour intermittently the noise is likely to give people nearby reasonable cause for annoyance If the council needs to use force to silence an alarm, they need a warrant. Find out more about powers of entry . Key holders in alarm notification areas Key holders must do all of the following: have keys to the property and be able to access the alarm live or be situated near the premises know how to turn the alarm off agree to be a key holder For non-residential premises, key holders must be one of the following: the owner or occupier of the premises someone acting on behalf of the owner or occupier (if the occupier or owner isn’t an individual, for example is owned by a company) a key holding company For residential properties, key holders must be one of the following: a nominated person or company who is not the owner or occupier a key holding company Noise from construction works Councils can serve a notice on people carrying out construction or demolition works and tell them how the work should be carried out to avoid a potential statutory noise nuisance. The notice can specify any of the following: a noise level the plant or machinery that can be used the hours when work can be done steps that need to be taken to minimise noise Those failing to comply with the notice can be prosecuted and fined an unlimited amount, with further fines for each day that they fail to comply. Applying for consent to carry out work People can also apply for consent to carry out work. They must include details of all the following: the works how the work will be carried out what steps will be taken to minimise noise resulting from the works The council must give consent for the work to go ahead if it’s satisfied that both: the application contains enough information it won’t need to serve a notice to control noise on the construction site Loudspeakers in the street It’s an offence to use loudspeakers at any time to advertise: entertainment trade business It’s an offence to use loudspeakers for any purpose in the street at night between 9pm and 8am. Exceptions: when loudspeakers can be used Loudspeakers can be used: in emergencies as a public address system in or fixed to vehicles, if certain rules are followed at a travelling pleasure fair to direct a vessel if the council gives consent In emergencies or for public information Loudspeakers can be used in an emergency or as a public address system. They can be used by: the police the fire brigade the ambulance service the Environment Agency water or sewage companies councils public transport operators to make announcements to passengers or prospective passengers (but not on a highway) On vehicles If used in a way unlikely to give reasonable cause for annoyance, loudspeakers can also be used if they’re in or fixed to a vehicle. The loudspeaker must be operated solely to do one of the following: warn other traffic (like a horn) entertain drivers or passengers communicate with passengers or drivers alert people that fresh food or drink is on sale (without speaking) - like chimes on ice cream vans (only from midday to 7pm) If an ice cream van operator is prosecuted or gets a noise abatement notice, but they’ve complied with the code of practice on noise from ice cream van chimes , they may be able to use this as grounds for an appeal or as a defence in court. Model aircraft noise If someone flying model aircraft on trade, business or industry premises gets a noise abatement notice, and they’ve complied with the code of practice on noise from model aircraft , they may be able to use this as grounds for an appeal or as a defence in court. Noise from industrial, trade or business premises: special rules If an abatement notice for noise is served on industrial, trade or business premises and they’ve used the best practicable means to stop or reduce the noise, they may be able to use this as one of the following: grounds for appeal against the abatement notice a defence, if prosecuted for not complying with the abatement notice Other ways councils can deal with noise Councils have separate powers to deal with anti-social noise . Councils should consider potential noise nuisances when: making planning decisions (this may require a noise impact assessment ) issuing entertainment licences making decisions about building controls (for example, checking that sound insulation is adequate) Find out more about how planners can manage potential noise impacts in new developments . Environmental permits The Environment Agency ( EA ) controls some potential noise nuisances with environmental permits as part of pollution control. Councils need to work closely with EA to make sure that people aren’t penalised twice for the same activity. If a facility has an environmental permit, councils must get the Secretary of State’s permission before prosecuting for breach of an abatement notice."

/government/news/lincolnshire-leads-the-way-in-innovation-with-exciting-new-3d-technology-which-tells-farmers-when-crops-are-ripe-for-harvesting,"Farming Minister praises innovative technology across the farming industry Lincolnshire leads the way in innovation with exciting new 3D technology which tells farmers when crops are ripe for harvesting  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs A pioneering new project in Lincolnshire using 3D camera technology to identify when broccoli is ready for harvesting has today been praised as ‘world leading’ by Farming Minister George Eustice. The Lincoln University project marks a key step towards the development of the world’s first fully robotic harvesting system for broccoli which could eventually be rolled out nationwide, significantly reducing costs for farmers. This is just one of two exciting projects in Lincolnshire to share £800,000 investment from government and industry as part of the Agri-Tech Catalyst. The second project is innovating the development of vitamin D enriched eggs. Speaking ahead of the annual Cereals Show in Lincolnshire, George Eustice said: Lincolnshire is leading the way when it comes to applying new technology to our food and farming industry, from the use of 3D cameras as a harvesting aid on broccoli to enriching eggs with vitamin D. We want to see our agriculture sector grow, become more competitive and more profitable which is why we are supporting projects like this through our agri-tech strategy. The two projects are: · 3D Vision Assisted Harvesting of Broccoli - led by Lincoln University, in partnership with R Fountain and Son, it will test 3D camera technology to identify when broccoli are ready for harvesting, significantly reducing production costs. It has received £138,000 Government funding, together with £40,000 from the private sector. · Sunshine Eggs - led by Noble Foods, in partnership with DSM Nutritional Products, it will develop vitamin D-enriched ‘sunshine’ eggs, by testing different hen diets, to help reduce Vitamin D deficiency in humans. It has received £124,000 Government funding, together with £496,000 from the private sector. Its poultry, and lead egg packing centre are based in Lincolnshire. Project lead Professor Tom Duckett, group co-ordinator of the Agri-Food Technology Research Group at the University of Lincoln, said: Broccoli is one of the world’s largest vegetable crops and is almost entirely manually harvested, which is costly. This technology is seen as being an important move towards developing fully automatic robot harvesting systems, which could then be used for a variety of different crops. In all our agri-related research work, our mission is to develop new technological solutions for the business of producing food through agriculture. More Information · To date, 77 projects worth nearly £60 million (government and industry) have been supported by the Agri-Tech Catalyst. · The £70 million Agri-Tech Catalyst is funded by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, and the Department for International Development.

/guidance/noise-pollution-economic-analysis,"This guide explains how impacts on noise should be incorporated into a cost benefit analysis. Noise pollution: economic analysis Assessing environmental impact Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Overview Noise can have an effect on health, wellbeing, productivity and the natural environment. The government’s policy on noise is set out in the Noise policy statement for England . It’s estimated that the annual social cost of urban road noise in England is £7 to 10 billion. This places it at a similar magnitude to road accidents (£9 billion) and significantly greater than the impact on climate change (£1 to 4 billion). A report published by the World Health Organisation (WHO) in March 2011 identified environmental noise as the second largest environmental health risk in Western Europe. It is important that the impacts on noise are fully considered in decision making for any policy, programme or project. The approach to use for valuing noise impacts will depend upon the decision being made. Economic valuation tools should be used for initial screening or decisions with a small impact on noise. Detailed analysis is required where the noise impacts may be substantial or have a large effect on the decision. Economic valuation tools Tools have been developed which convert changes in noise exposure to estimated monetary values, to support the assessment of the effects of environmental noise. The central estimates of values for road, rail and aircraft exposure are presented in Table 1 and Table 2. A range of sensitivities are available around these values from the Noise Modelling Tool.

If detailed data are not available for the specific indicator of interest, the available results for the daytime indicator can be used as an approximation for the other required indicator (e.g. assume Lden = LAeq,16h). This type of approach cannot be used for night noise. Sleep disturbance has been excluded for rail and aircraft but included for road in the table above. For road where Lnight is not available the daytime metric can be transformed into Lnight. However this relationship is not applicable for rail and aircraft.

The scale of the assessment depends upon the characteristics of the decision. It is therefore not possible to provide a specific method that can be used in all situations. To discuss the best approach to assess the impacts of noise, it is recommended that you contact IGCB @defra.gov.uk . To inform these discussions please have the following information available: background on the decision being made an outline of the proposal and different options being assessed the indicative noise assessment undertaken timing of the analysis to feed into the decision quantitative estimates of the other impacts of the decision The appropriate evidence will depend on a range of factors. The potential areas for consideration can be broadly separated into four groups: Amenity - the conscious displeasure of those exposed to the noise. At present two amenity impacts can be quantified and valued; sleep disturbance and annoyance. Health - noise is associated with a range of effects on health. The three health effects currently valued are heart attacks, strokes and dementia. Productivity - through distraction, fatigue and interrupting communication noise can have a negative impact on productivity. It is not yet possible to assess and value these impacts. Environmental - noise can have a notable impact on the natural environment, for example noise may alter bird breeding patterns, disturb wildlife and damage sensitive ecosystems. At this time these impacts have not been valued. The effects of night noise, school attainment and other factors such as the value of quiet areas have not been fully quantified. These cannot be included in full appraisal but it may be important to include these in future research.

/guidance/bat-roosts-use-of-chemical-pest-control-products-and-timber-treatments-in-or-near-them,"Find out what you need to know before you use chemicals in a location with a known bat roost and which are suitable. Bat roosts: use of chemical pest control products and timber treatments in or near them Wildlife and habitat conservation Natural England Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs All bat species, their breeding sites and resting places are fully protected by law. You may however need to use a chemical product in or near a bat roost as: an insecticide to control pests a timber treatment to protect against insects, fungal growth or weathering You can’t use chemical products in or near a known bat roost if there are bats present. Before you start you’ll need to carry out a thorough search for any signs of bats eg fresh bat droppings. The best time to apply treatments is between autumn and spring when bat numbers are generally lower. When you’re as certain as you can be that the area is clear of bats, tell the bat advice helpline of your intended action. The tables provided below list the chemical substances that Natural England is aware are currently approved for use under the Control of Pesticides Regulations ( COPR ). Other products are available and the Health and Safety Executive website has searchable pesticides databases but not all of these are safe to use near bat roosts. Using insecticides When controlling pests using insecticides you should: check the [InlineAttachment:3] to see which products are currently approved for the control of: cluster fly wasp bee hornet use the listed product as directed on the packaging only use products listed as ‘professional-use’ if you’re experienced to do so take care when treating feral bees to make sure other working bees are not harmed Treating timber to protect against insects, fungal growth or weathering Treating timber on site in or near a bat roost may be needed to control: common furniture beetle (woodworm) deathwatch beetle longhorn beetle dry rot wet rot Check [InlineAttachment:1] to see which products are suitable for use in or near bat roosts. If your product isn’t listed, check the active ingredients listed in [InlineAttachment:2]. You can use the product around bat roosts if it contains only 1 active ingredient as long as you use the product as directed on the packaging. If the product doesn’t appear in table 1 and has 2 or more active ingredients you should contact the manufacturer before using it. See the product label for more information. Pre-treated timber products Pre-treated timber products are not included in the tables above. You can use timber that’s been pre-treated off-site, because the chemicals are injected deep into the timber leaving lower concentrations on the surface, which isn’t harmful to bats. However you shouldn’t apply products used to pre-treat timber on-site, because the active ingredients will be more concentrated on the timber surface and may be harmful to bats. Stains and preservatives Decorative wood finishes, like stains or wood preservative can be used around bat roosts, as long as you only use them on external timber."

/government/news/lakes-and-dales-decisions-create-largest-area-of-english-national-park-land,"Environment Secretary Elizabeth Truss announces the decision to extend the Yorkshire Dales and the Lake District. Lakes and Dales decisions create largest area of English National Park land  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Yorkshire, Cumbria and Lancashire will share the largest area of almost continuous National Park land following the decision to extend two of England’s most celebrated National Parks , the Yorkshire Dales and the Lake District. The announcement by Environment Secretary Elizabeth Truss today will see the Yorkshire Dales grow by nearly 24% and Lake District by 3%. This will virtually join up these beautiful spaces, boosting rural tourism in the area, supporting rural businesses and potentially adding millions more to the £4 billion already generated by visitors to our stunning National Parks each year. The announcement, which will protect these landscapes for future generations, was made as the Secretary of State visited Wensleydale Creamery, based in the Yorkshire Dales National Park and home of the protected Yorkshire Wensleydale cheese – one of many successful businesses within National Parks. Commenting on the decision to extend the Parks Environment Secretary Elizabeth Truss, said: The Dales and the Lakes have some of our country’s finest landscapes, beautiful vistas and exciting wildlife. They are part of our national identity. I am delighted to be able to announce this extension which will join these two unique National Parks and protect even more space for generations to come. National Parks are fabulous national assets that welcome over 90 million tourists and contribute to our vibrant rural economy – we are committed to helping them thrive. The announcement builds on the Secretary of State’s speech last week setting out her vision for a 25 year Environment Plan, and is the first step in delivering this government’s manifesto commitment of stronger protections for natural landscapes to ensure Britain has the best natural environment anywhere. By protecting and promoting access to wide swathes of rural England, and providing attractive places to undertake physical activity and environmental volunteering - or simply take in the view - the extensions will help us to make the country the healthiest and most beautiful place in the world to live, work and bring up a family. The move could also serve to strengthen the next generation’s connection with nature through the environmental activities available for families and children. Also commenting on the extensions Natural England Chairman Andrew Sells added: I very much welcome the Secretary of State’s decision to extend the Yorkshire Dales and Lake District National Parks in line with the recommendations made by Natural England. The Chancellor’s Northern Powerhouse depends upon the ‘natural capital’ provided by our iconic National Parks. They represent some of England’s most treasured natural assets. With international appeal, their stunning landscapes stand out as a beacon to the people who come to enjoy them whilst their intrinsic value drives the communities, businesses and biodiversity they support. Extending these today confirms their great importance and provides them with the recognition they richly deserve.” Further information An additional 188 square miles of land across Cumbria and a small part of Lancashire will now be protected for future generations following the decision to extend two of England’s most iconic National Parks. This covers: Lake District East - to include an area from Birkbeck Fells Common to Whinfell Common South - to include an area from Helsington Barrows to Sizergh Fell, an area north of Sizergh Castle and part of the Lyth valley Yorkshire Dales North - to include parts of the Orton Fells, the northern Howgill Fells, Wild Boar Fell and Mallerstang West - to include Barbon, Middleton, Casterton and Leck Fells, the River Lune, and part of Firbank Fell and other fells to the west of the River Lune The extension areas will come into effect in August 2016. Tourism is hugely important to the rural economy, contributing around £11 billion each year. It’s also the main driver behind 13% of rural employment and 10% of rural businesses. National Parks are a vital part of this visitor economy and more than 90 million people visit them each year helping to boost rural economies. Over one third of England’s protected foods are produced within the National Parks. Since 2010, the number of protected foods in the UK has increased from 40 to 64. The Secretary of State’s Open Environment Speech was delivered to environmental pioneers on 14 October. Natural England is the Government’s statutory advisor on landscape, with specific responsibilities for designating and amending boundaries of National Parks, Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty and Heritage Coasts. A legal document – known as a variation order – paved the way for the Secretary of State’s decision."

The seed has been sown in small plots at several sites in England and Scotland, mostly as part of conventional trials for official registration of new plant varieties. The GMI was informed by a seed company after a test result on a batch of imported seed indicated a possible GM presence. The company responsible is cooperating to ensure destruction of all the affected plants, with the GMI overseeing this activity in England. Seed from the same batch that has not been planted is being recalled. There is no risk to adjacent crops or the wider environment as plants that have grown from the affected seed would not flower until next spring."

/government/news/force-crag-mine-water-treatment-scheme-opens-in-cumbria,"Minister Rory Stewart opens Europe’s first zero-chemical, zero-power, metal mine water-treatment scheme Force Crag mine water treatment scheme opens in Cumbria  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs An innovative treatment works using the natural environment to clean metal-rich water from an abandoned mine has been opened by Water Minister Rory Stewart in Cumbria today. Set in the breath-taking Cumbrian hills near Keswick, the Force Crag mine water treatment scheme is now up and running. The scheme will clean up a 6 mile stretch of river, preventing up to a tonne of metals, including zinc, cadmium and lead, from entering Bassenthwaite Lake each year. The scheme will contribute up to £4.9 million in environmental benefits to Keswick’s water and wildlife while boosting tourism and the local economy. Funded by Defra, the scheme is part of the Government’s £8.5 million investment in low-cost solutions to tackle water pollution caused by abandoned metal mines that pollute over 1000 miles of rivers in England. The concept was developed by Dr Adam Jarvis and his team at Newcastle University and delivered by the Coal Authority in partnership with the Environment Agency, the National Trust, the Lake District National Park Authority and others. Water Minister Rory Stewart said: I’m delighted to be here today in the incredible Cumbrian hills to open Europe’s first treatment scheme, using the natural environment to clean metal-rich water from the Force Crag abandoned mine. This will improve local water quality while still maintaining the beauty of this truly unique site. This project is part of Defra’s £8.5 million investment in solutions to tackle mine water pollution and an excellent example of partnership working with Defra, the Coal Authority, the Environment Agency, the National Trust, Lake District National Park Authority and others all coming together to bring this world leading scheme to life. Stephen Dingle, Chair, Coal Authority, said: Our experts prevent and treat water pollution from Britain’s abandoned coal and metal mines, managing over 70 mine water treatment schemes to protect and improve over 350km of rivers. We also prevent important sources of drinking water from being polluted. Working with our partners we’ve now built and are managing our first ever passive metal mine water treatment scheme to address the pollution which comes from Force Crag Mine in the Lake District National Park. The scheme has been carefully designed to be consistent with the beautiful surroundings and address this major source of metal pollution, which affects Bassenthwaite Lake and other local watercourses. We are delighted with its excellent performance in removing in excess of 95% of the metals from the mine water. Environmental Engineer Dr Adam Jarvis, Newcastle University, said: Newcastle University’s design of the water treatment process at Force Crag followed more than 10 years’ research and development, starting in the laboratory and culminating in this unique large-scale treatment system. Working in partnership, it’s a great example of undertaking research to resolve a real world problem – pollution from abandoned mines. Keith Ashcroft, of the Environment Agency said: We were delighted to be involved in the Force Crag treatment system. Our rivers are the healthiest for 20 years, and we are working hard to maintain what we have achieved so far and to further improve water quality and biodiversity. This system is the first of its kind in the Europe and the results of monitoring here will help to design even more effective, sustainable, mine water treatment systems for the 1,700 km of rivers polluted by abandoned metal mines elsewhere in England. Innovations such as this over the next five years will help the Environment Agency to work in partnership to improve another 6,000kms of rivers and 50 bathing waters.

/government/collections/river-basin-management-plans-2015,"River basin management plans (RBMPs) set out how organisations, stakeholders and communities will work together to improve the water environment. River basin management plans: 2015  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Environment Agency Current RBMPs These are the current river basin district (RBD) RBMPs. They are an update to the first plans published in 2009. See the 2009 river basin management plans . A RBD covers an entire river system, including river, lake, groundwater, estuarine and coastal water bodies. The RBD RBMPs are designed to protect and improve the quality of our water environment. Good quality water is essential for wildlife, agriculture and business to thrive. And is one of the means for boosting regeneration (both structural and economic), recreation and tourism. These updated 2015 plans build on the work already done to protect and improve over 9,320 miles of our rivers over the last 5 years. They set out how a minimum of 680 (14%) of waters will improve over the next 6 years from around £3 billion investment. The RBMPs support the government’s framework for the 25-year environment plan. And will allow local communities to find more cost-effective ways to take action to further improve our water environment. Use RBMPs if you need: information on the plan for the protection and improvement of the water environment to know how future plans may affect an industry sector and its obligations to ensure a development proposal considers the requirements of the RBMP to apply for an environmental permit to contribute to the delivery of the plan or maximise potential funding for a project Links with the Marine Strategy Framework Directive There are strong links between RBMPs and the UK’s Marine Strategy which implements the Marine Strategy Framework Directive. Measures in the RBMPs will contribute to achieving good environmental status in the UK seas. See the UK’s Marine Strategy Part 3: programme of measures . RBMPs in England and Wales Use the map to find your RBD . There are 11 river basin districts in England and Wales. The Environment Agency manage the 7 RBDs in England. Natural Resources Wales (NRW) manage the Western Wales RBD. NRW and the Environment Agency jointly manage the Dee and Severn RBDs. See the RBMPs for Western Wales and Dee on the NRW website . RBMPs in Scotland The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) and the Environment Agency jointly manage the Solway Tweed RBD. See the Solway Tweed RBMP on the SEPA website . Update to the RBMPs RBMPs must be reviewed and updated every 6 years. A consultation on the draft update to RBMPs ran from October 2014 to April 2015. See the consultation on the draft RBMPs . For both the review and the update to the RBMPs appropriate public consultation and engagement methods were used. Learn more in the record of consultation and engagement . The RBMPs have been approved by the Secretary of State for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. They have been prepared in line with Ministerial guidance, fulfil the requirements of the Water Framework Directive and contribute to the objectives of other EU directives.

/guidance/surface-water-pollution-risk-assessment-for-your-environmental-permit,"How to carry out a risk assessment if you're applying for a bespoke permit that includes discharging hazardous pollutants to surface water.   Surface water pollution risk assessment for your environmental permit Water Environmental permits Environment Agency Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs You must follow this guide if both of the following apply: you’re applying for a permit that includes discharging hazardous pollutants to surface water under the Environmental Permitting Regulations you need to carry out a bespoke risk assessment - bespoke permits are environmental permits customised to your own activities and are usually required if your site produces emissions that exceed certain levels or multiple types of emissions Read the risk assessment overview before reading this guide. Hazardous pollutants are the pollutants listed in the following tables: [InlineAttachment:1] [InlineAttachment:2] [InlineAttachment:3] [InlineAttachment:4] You must measure any hazardous pollutants you plan to release into surface water. You must then carry out screening tests on the pollutants to check if they’re a risk to the environment. You must carry out screening tests when: you’re applying for a new permit you need to change your permit to cover an increase in the amount of hazardous pollutants you plan to discharge or if you plan to discharge a new hazardous pollutant you’re applying to change (vary) your permit for another reason and the hazardous pollutants in your discharge haven’t been assessed since 2010 Screening tests check the risk from hazardous pollutants to the environment. If your screening tests show there’s a risk to the environment, the Environment Agency will tell you if more detailed tests need to be carried out. The detailed tests are known as ‘modelling’: the Environment Agency may need to carry out modelling if you’re discharging to freshwater (you’ll need to carry out modelling if it’s required if you’re discharging to a lake or canal) you may need to carry out modelling if you’re discharging to an estuary or coastal waters When you don’t need to carry out screening tests You don’t usually need to carry out screening tests if you discharge water taken from a river or groundwater to the same body of water you originally took from or if you haven’t added any additional hazardous pollutants to the water. However, you do need to do screening tests if you: take the water from groundwater and discharge it to surface water use the water in a process which concentrates the existing pollutants before it’s discharged, eg water which is used for cooling and therefore partially evaporates keep the water before you discharge it and you make the quality of river worse than its quality when the water was taken How to do your screening tests There are 3 stages to screening. Identify the pollutants released from your plant. Gather data on your pollutants before screening them. Carry out screening tests on the data. Identify the pollutants released from your plant You’ll need to produce a list of any hazardous pollutants that are likely to be in the discharge from your site. Find potentially hazardous pollutants in the following tables: [InlineAttachment:1] [InlineAttachment:2] [InlineAttachment:3] [InlineAttachment:4] Pollutants are likely to be in the discharge if: they’re allowed to be added to the discharge (eg water company trade effluent consent or discharges from installations) you’ve added them to the discharge (eg iron or aluminium to remove phosphorus). Read the Environment Agency’s guidance on dosed substances for the rules on this you’ve detected them using chemical analysis To do chemical analysis you’ll need to take samples of the discharge and send them to a United Kingdom Accreditation Service ( UKAS ) accredited laboratory like the National Laboratory Service . Make sure the laboratory tests for all pollutants which you expect to find in the discharge and that they use an appropriate ‘limit of detection’ ( LOD ) (usually 10% of the environmental quality standards ( EQS )). You must submit the chemical analysis data that’s been analysed to an appropriate LOD by a UKAS -accredited laboratory with your application. If you submit data which hasn’t been analysed to an appropriate LOD you must tell the Environment Agency why, for example: samples may be from different sources (eg clean water, polluted water, sewerage discharge or industrial discharge) and may need to be diluted before they can be analysed the discharge may be diluted and analysis against the LOD may not be possible Gather data on your pollutants before screening them You need to measure your pollutants if you release hazardous pollutants into: freshwaters estuaries and coastal waters sewers For each pollutant you’ll need the following: the chemical name of the pollutant being analysed the unit of measurement, eg micrograms per litre the maximum, minimum and average recorded concentrations of the pollutant in the discharge the maximum and average recorded discharge flow for freshwaters - the average concentration of the pollutants in the water upstream of the discharge if it’s available (if not, you can use estimated data ) and the 95% exceedence river flow (you can request this from the Environment Agency) for estuaries and coastal waters - the background concentrations at the discharge point total metal data (collect dissolved metal data at the same time in case any of your pollutants need modelling) a minimum of 12 samples (the ideal number is 36) the LOD used the relevant EQS Estimated data You need to use estimated data for the screening tests if you don’t have any discharge monitoring data, eg for new discharges that you aren’t yet discharging. For AA (annual average) EQS you need average discharge concentrations, with a minimum of 12 individual sample results from on-site tests or a proxy site (a similar sized site and manufacturing process which is likely to have a similar discharge). You’ll need to average your results - if you have a less than figure you must round it up to the nearest whole number (eg less than 10 is assumed to be 10). Intermittent discharge If you discharge pollutants intermittently (eg you operate 12 hours a day, 5 days a week or you operate seasonally) you’ll need to work out the average flow rate to use in the screening tests. If your discharge starts and stops regularly, eg once a day, you’ll need to work out the average flow rate during discharge and then multiply it by the proportion of the year that the discharge takes place. For example, if you discharge at 100 litres per second for 12 hours every day of the year, the average flow rate would be 100 x 0.5 = 50 litres per second. If your discharge runs for only part of the year, eg continuously for 6 months and then stops for 6 months, use the average flow rate during the 6 months you operate. For example, if you discharge at 100 litres per second continuously for 6 months and then stop discharging for the other 6 months, the average flow rate would be 100 litres per second. Check with the Environment Agency if your discharge pattern is different to both of these examples. Background data for estuaries or coastal waters You’ll need the following data on background pollutant concentrations to carry out the screening tests: for new pollutants that you haven’t discharged before - a sample of data from the planned discharge point for existing pollutants - a sample of data taken from a point away from the discharge point (so it’s not affected by the discharge plume) for estuaries where the background quality can vary depending on the tide - use the maximum background value for the pollutant concentration rather than the average value If you don’t have upstream or background data for estuaries or coastal waters and freshwaters Assume that the concentration of each pollutant is 10% of the EQS in clean water (eg where there’s no other discharges of the pollutant) and 50% of the EQS in polluted water (where there are other discharges of the pollutant). If you’re unsure, assume that the upstream concentration is 50% of the EQS . Calculate the concentration of pollutant in the discharge when discharging to a sewer Sewerage treatment works will remove a proportion of the pollutant in the discharge before it’s discharged to a freshwater or estuary or coastal water. You must take this into account when you calculate the concentration of the hazardous pollutant which you’ll discharge to the river or coastal water through the sewer. The amount of each pollutant which will be removed by a sewerage works is known as the sewage treatment reduction factor. These factors have been calculated for each individual pollutant. Use the following calculation to work out the concentration of the pollutant after sewage treatment: Multiply the concentration of the pollutant in your discharge released to the sewer in milligrams per litre by the sewage treatment reduction factor in milligrams per litre. You’ll need to average your results - if you have a less than figure you must round it up to the nearest whole number (eg less than 10 is assumed to be 10). For AA EQS , you should use the average release concentrations and for MAC EQS you should use the maximum release concentration. Download the sewage treatment reduction factors: [InlineAttachment:5] Carry out screening tests on the data from the pollutants You must compare the measurements of pollutants from your discharge to the following: environmental quality standards ( EQS ) maximum allowable concentrations ( MAC ) - to evaluate the short term environmental impacts that your emissions can cause environmental quality standards ( EQS ) annual average ( AA ) - to evaluate the long term environmental impacts that your emissions can cause The MAC and AA EQS for the pollutants are listed in the following tables: [InlineAttachment:1] [InlineAttachment:2] [InlineAttachment:3] [InlineAttachment:4] Not all pollutants have both types of EQS . When a pollutant has both an AA and MAC EQS , compare the measurements of pollutants from your discharge to the AA , apart from test 4 for freshwaters where you must use the MAC EQS as well. You must compare the measurements of pollutants from your discharge to the MAC as well as the AA if you release it in batches rather than continuously. Screening tests: freshwaters Carry out the following tests to check whether your discharge of hazardous pollutants to freshwaters is a risk to the environment. For each test you’ll need to provide more data than for the previous one. If your pollutant is screened out by a test, you don’t need to complete the rest of the tests. Contact the Environment Agency to get access to the screening tool to help you carry out these tests. Test 1 Check whether the concentration of the pollutant in the discharge is more than 10% of the environmental quality standard ( EQS ). If it’s less than 10% you don’t need to collect the data for the next 3 tests - you don’t need to anything more as your hazardous pollutant isn’t a risk to the environment. If it’s more than 10%, carry out test 2. If you have 2 or more discharges of the same pollutant from different parts of your plant you’ll need to test them separately. Environmental quality standards ( EQS ) for freshwaters Download the EQS for freshwaters: [InlineAttachment:2] [InlineAttachment:4] Test 2 This test introduces the dilution available in the receiving water. You’ll need the river flow data and daily discharge volume for this test. Check whether the process contribution ( PC ) of your pollutant is more than 4% of the EQS . PC is the concentration of a discharged pollutant in the water after it’s been diluted. Contact the Environment Agency to get the river flow data for the water you’re discharging to. Do the following steps to work out the PC . Multiply the effluent flow rate ( EFR ) by the release concentration of the pollutant in the effluent ( RC ). Add your value for the EFR to the river flow rate ( RFR ). Divide the result of step 1 by the result of step 2. If your value for PC is 4% or less of the EQS , you don’t need to carry out tests 3 and 4. If the PC is more than 4% of the EQS you’ll need to carry out tests 3 and 4. Test 3 You need the background concentration data ( BC ) for this test. Contact the Environment Agency to get the BC for the water you’re discharging to or use estimated data. Check whether your discharge increases the concentration of the pollutant in the river downstream of the discharge by more than 10% of the pollutant’s EQS value. The predicted environmental concentration ( PEC ) in the water downstream of the discharge is a combination of the PC and background concentration. To work out the PEC add the PC to the average BC . If the result of step 2 in test 2 shows that the river flow rate is less than 10 times the effluent discharge flow rate you should also do the following calculation. Multiply EFR by RC . Multiply RFR by BC . Add the results of step 1 and 2 together. Add EFR to RFR . Divide the result from step 3 by the result from step 4. If the difference between BC and PEC is more than 10% of the EQS the Environment Agency will need to carry out modelling (if you’re discharging to a canal or lake you’ll need to do the modelling). If it isn’t, carry out test 4. Test 4 Check whether the PEC is higher than the EQS . If it is, the Environment Agency will need to carry out modelling (you’ll need to do the modelling if you’re discharging to a canal or lake). Screening tests: estuaries and coastal waters Carry out the following tests to check if your plant will discharge potentially hazardous pollutants to estuaries and coastal waters. For each test you’ll need you to provide more data than for the previous one. If your process involves using cooling water you must carry out these alternative tests . Contact the Environment Agency to get access to the screening tool to help you carry out these tests. Test 1 Check whether the level of pollutant in the discharge is more than the EQS limits. You need to test for both annual average limits and maximum allowable concentration if the pollutant has both types of EQS . If the pollutant is more than EQS limits, carry out test 2. If it’s below EQS limits you don’t need to anything more as your pollutant isn’t a risk to the environment. Environmental quality standards ( EQS ) for estuaries and coastal waters Download the EQS for estuaries and coastal waters: [InlineAttachment:1] [InlineAttachment:3] Test 2 Check whether you’re discharging to the low water channel (ie the water doesn’t flow across the estuary bed at any stage of the tide) in the upper parts of an estuary where the water is mainly fresh. If the discharge is direct to the low water channel, do the screening tests for freshwater starting at test 2. In the calculations for freshwater tests 2 to 4 use the freshwater flow rate and upstream quality but use the EQSs for estuaries and coastal waters. If these don’t apply to your discharge site, carry out test 3. Test 3 The Environment Agency will do test 3 for you if the water you discharge into has restricted dilution or dispersion like a small coastal bay (eg Lulworth Cove) or a creek in an estuary. Contact the Environment Agency to find out if your discharge site has restricted dilution or dispersion. If you’re discharging to water where the dilution or dispersion is restricted you’ll need to carry out modelling. Test 4 If the water you discharge to doesn’t have restricted dilution or dispersion and the discharge is submerged at all states of the tide, you need to measure the minimum distance between the point you discharge waste water from and the point (or line) where the water depths are shown on nautical charts as zero (which is known as chart datum). Use online navigation charts to check the location you’re discharging to. You will need to carry out modelling if the discharge contains pollutants at concentrations above EQS and either of the following apply: the discharge location is less than 50m offshore from where the sea bed is at chart datum the sea bed at the discharge location is less than 1m below chart datum If these don’t apply to your discharge site, carry out test 5. Test 5 You can only carry out this test if the discharge is buoyant, ie it’s less dense than the seawater. Most discharges to estuaries and coastal waters are buoyant, as they are mainly freshwater discharges to a salty environment. If the discharge isn’t buoyant, for example if the receiving water is fresh, then you’ll need to carry out modelling . Check if the effective volume flux of the discharge is within the allowable limits. The maximum effective volume flux you can work with is proportional to the water depth, for depths up to 3.5m below the depth of water at the point where chartered water depths are shown on nautical charts (chart datum). For example, if the water depth below chart datum is 2m the allowable effective volume flux is 2 cubic metres per second. For water depths more than 3.5m below chart datum, the allowable effective volume flux is fixed at 3.5 cubic metres per second. Work out the effective volume flux of the discharge. Multiply the effluent discharge rate (in cubic metres per second) by the release concentration of the pollutant (in micrograms per litre). Subtract the average background concentration of the discharge location from the EQS . Divide the result of step 1 by the result of step 2. Check your pollutants against the maximum annual concentration ( MAC ) EQS as well as against the AA . If the effective volume flux is more than the allowable effective volume flux for the discharge location you will need to carry out modelling . If it’s less you don’t need to do anything further. Screening tests: discharges into cooling water which are then discharged to estuaries or coastal waters You need to check how much the pollutants are diluted by the cooling water in your plant before the discharge reaches the receiving water, to check whether modelling is needed. Work out the predicted average concentration in the cooling water. Multiply the average background concentration by the average cooling water flow. Add the average load of the pollutant in your waste stream to the result from step 1. Add the average process waste stream flow to the average cooling water flow. Divide the result of step 2 by the result of step 4. Work out the predicted maximum concentration in the cooling water. Multiply the maximum background concentration by the minimum cooling water flow. Add the maximum load of the pollutant in your waste stream to the result from step 1. Add the average process waste stream flow to the minimum cooling water flow. Divide the result of step 2 by the result of step 4. You’ll need to carry out modelling if the concentration of the pollutant in the cooling water is more than the relevant EQS AA or MAC . If it’s less you don’t need to do anything further. Screening test: ‘priority hazardous pollutants’ You must carry out additional screening for all priority hazardous pollutants for freshwaters and priority hazardous pollutants for coastal waters and estuaries even if the pollutants didn’t need modelling as a result of screening tests 1 to 4 for freshwaters or tests 1 to 6 for estuaries and coastal waters. The priority hazardous pollutants are listed in the following tables: [InlineAttachment:3] [InlineAttachment:4] You need to find out whether the annual limit of pollutants you discharge is more than the significant load limit (an annual load limit that has been set for priority hazardous pollutants). Significant load limits Pollutant Annual significant load limit in kg Anthracene 1 Brominated diphenyl ether 1 Cadmium 5 C10-13 Chloroalkanes 1 Endosulphan 1 Hexachlorobenzene 1 Hexachlorobutadiene 1 Hexachloro-cyclohexane 1 Mercury and its compounds 1 Nonylphenol (4-Nonylphenol) 1 Pentachlorobenzene 1 Polycyclic aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) 5 Tributyltin compounds (Tributylin-cation) 1 Calculate the significant load Multiply the average discharge concentration by the average flow (litres a day). Divide the result by 1,000 to give you mg a day. Divide the result by 1,000 to give you g a day. Divide the result by 1,000 to give you kg a day. Multiply the result by 365 to give you kg a year. Check your result against the relevant significant load in significant load limits table. If the load you calculate is less than the significant load for the pollutant and the pollutant didn’t need modelling as a result of screening tests 1 to 4 for freshwaters or tests 1 to 6 for estuaries and coastal waters, the pollutant is insignificant and you don’t need to do anything further. If the load you calculate is less than the significant load for the pollutant and the pollutant did need modelling as a result of screening tests 1 to 4 for freshwaters or tests 1 to 6 for estuaries and coastal waters: the Environment Agency will need to carry out modelling if you’re discharging to freshwater (except lakes and canals) you’ll need to carry out modelling if you’re discharging to an estuary or coastal waters If the load you calculate is more than the significant load for the pollutant, you must repeat the test with cleaned-up data (this means making some changes to make sure your data is accurate). Calculate the significant load using cleaned-up data Repeat the significant load screening test using cleaned-up data. If your calculations with cleaned-up data are more than the significant load for the pollutant, the Environment Agency will include an emission limit in your permit which will tell you how to control the pollutant. If the pollutant didn’t pass one or more of the screening tests: the Environment Agency will need to carry out modelling if you’re discharging to freshwater you’ll need to carry out modelling if you’re discharging to an estuary or coastal waters You don’t need to do anything further if the load you calculate is less than the significant load for the pollutant and it passed tests 1 to 4 for freshwaters or 1 to 6 for estuaries and coastal waters. Cleaning up your data Check that a minimum number of your samples exceed the limit of detection ( LOD ). Number of samples in assessment period Minimum number of samples which need to be equal to or above the required LOD 12 to 14 4 15 to 20 5 21 to 27 6 28 to 34 7 35 to 41 8 42 to 48 9 49 to 56 10 57 to 63 11 64 to 71 12 72 to 79 13 80 to 86 14 87 to 94 15 95 to 102 16 If a minimum number of your samples don’t exceed the LOD , the pollutant isn’t a risk to the environment and you don’t need to carry out modelling (this only applies if your LOD was 10% of the EQS or less). Follow these steps to check that your data represent the current situation at your plant. Check whether there are significant changes (ie changes that are obviously different when you look at the data particularly if you know the reasons for the change) in your data over a period of time, eg changes in effluent treatment or changes in trade inputs to a sewerage works. If there are significant changes, select a time period which reflects current quality even if this means using less than 3 years’ data. Your data must include a minimum of 12 samples. If your data is not evenly distributed, eg there is seasonal variation, it can still be used, but you should consider the uneven spread when you interpret the results. You can analyse seasonal variation using a statistics package. You may need to contact the Environment Agency to help you interpret the data. Check your data is current, eg you should include any recent treatment processes that might have altered the discharge. Check your data for very high or low values (‘outliers’) as these may not be accurate and could distort your data. For example, a value may be correct but relate to exceptional circumstances such as treatment failure, so you shouldn’t include it in your assessment. Or a value might be correct and a normal part of your activity, so you should include it in your assessment. Modelling You need to find a consultant to carry out detailed tests called modelling if your screening tests for estuaries and coastal waters didn’t screen out the pollutants. Consultants should contact the Environment Agency to find out about modelling and read the guidance on carrying out modelling . The Environment Agency will carry out the modelling tests for you if your screening tests for freshwaters showed that your discharge is a risk to the environment, unless you’re discharging into a lake or canal, then you must carry out modelling. Modelling tests will show whether your discharge will cause pollution or not. If the modelling tests show that your discharge will cause pollution, the Environment Agency will include conditions to control the hazardous pollutant in your permit or they may refuse your permit application if the impact on the environment is unacceptable. Submit your results Submit the results of your screening tests to the Environment Agency along with your application for a new permit or to change an existing permit. You can submit your results in the screening tool if you have used this to carry out the tests. You must also include the raw data you used for screening.

/government/news/celebrating-the-nations-bees-needs-pollinator-heroes,"Lord Gardiner honours pollinator-friendly projects and urges the public to take action to meet bees' needs this winter.    Celebrating the nation's Bees' Needs pollinator heroes  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs An inner-London ‘nectar bar’ and a disused coal mine transformed into a pollen-rich hay meadow are among a range of innovative projects helping protect the nation’s pollinators being celebrated today by Defra Minister Lord Gardiner. The Bees’ Needs Champions Awards, hosted at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, brings together 30 champions to celebrate bee-friendly initiatives, from playgrounds to parks and farms to famous shopping streets. As winter approaches, bee experts are also calling on the public to take action to keep bees buzzing over winter, with tips on providing homes and food as the temperature drops. Speaking ahead of the Bees’ Needs Champions Awards, Minister for Rural Affairs and Biosecurity Lord Gardiner said: Pollinators are essential for food production and the environment. The Bees’ Needs champions show us how to keep our pollinators happy and healthy all year round, and their efforts are an inspiration for us all. They show that whether you have access to acres of land or just a window box, everyone can play a part in helping these vital insects thrive. The awards celebrate success in six categories: youth groups, schools, local authorities, farming, construction and community groups. They have been judged by a number of organisations on adopting Defra’s National Pollinator Strategy. The champions come from all over England and are responsible for a wide range of projects. In Sydenham, south London, Grow Mayow community garden features its own nectar bar. Originally an old park keeper depot, it is now home to an award-winning garden with wild flowers and a beehive. Over winter, the garden is planted with a fast-growing ‘green manure’, providing winter food for pollinators and nutrients for the soil. In Shropshire, the site of a former coal mine was left badly scarred by its industrial past before being turned into a pollinators paradise. The Severn Valley Country Park opened in 1992 and since then volunteers have been looking after five hectares of species‐rich hay meadows and bee hives. Volunteers trained as beekeepers are harvesting mason bee larvae to give to local fruit growers, so young bees can grow and pollinate fruit crops. Paul de Zylva of Friends of the Earth, one of the organisations working with the Government to put the National Pollinator Strategy into effect, said: These terrific Pollinator Heroes from across the country show how everyone can help bees and pollinators anytime, anyplace, anywhere—all year round and wherever we live. The beauty is, you don’t have to wait for summer to start playing your part in reversing bee and pollinator decline. Taking action also helps bring the National Pollinator Strategy alive in homes, at work, at school and in your community. Let’s all be part of the generation to save our bees. While the natural lifecycle of many bees in the UK means you will see them less often, pollinators still need food and shelter to survive the winter. Calling for everyone to take action to help bees and pollinators over the winter, Lord Gardiner added: Bees are a much-loved feature of English summertime and crucial contributors to our biodiversity and our economy. But it is important not to forget bees’ needs during the winter months too, when providing food and a home are more important than ever. Planting evergreens for winter food and leaving areas of gardens undisturbed through the winter to provide homes mean we can all help pollinators emerge safely in the spring. Experts have highlighted a number of easy steps everyone can take to help pollinators over the winter: Plant flowers, shrubs and trees that thrive in winter. The evergreen mahonia is excellent winter food for bees, while the pendant bells of winter flowering clematis can give pollinators a sugary energy boost. Ivy plants are also an ideal source of food for bees in late autumn - avoid cutting them down. Leave suitable places for hibernation undisturbed. Letting areas of a lawn grow long until the spring can provide a hibernation home while cool, north-facing banks are ideal places for bees to burrow. The hollow tubes of dead stems of plants in borders can also serve as a great nesting spot. Plant early flowering bulbs like crocus, primrose, snowdrop of coltsfoot that flower in February and March to help support bees and pollinators looking for an early feed. Winter is also the perfect time to plant bee-friendly trees, such as acacia, blackthorn and hazel.

/government/news/h1n1-found-in-turkeys,"A routine disease investigation has ruled out avian notifiable disease but detected H1N1 influenza in turkeys on a farm in Cheshire. H1N1 found in turkeys  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs The strain is closely similar to the human pandemic H1N1 strain currently circulating. The Health Protection Agency has undertaken a thorough public health risk assessment and can confirm there is no risk to public health. This finding has resulted from a routine notifiable avian disease investigation relating to a small number of turkeys showing mild signs of disease. During the investigation there was clinical improvement in these birds. Results of laboratory tests show that statutory notifiable avian disease - where the government would need to take animal health action - can be ruled out. Restrictions have been lifted on the farm. There is no food safety risk. Pandemic H1N1, in common with avian influenza, has not been shown to be transmissible to people through eating properly handled and cooked poultry meat, products and eggs. Bird keepers should continue to maintain appropriate biosecurity measures and be vigilant for signs of notifiable avian disease and report any suspicion promptly to the Animal Health agency. Notes Pandemic H1N1 2009 has been confirmed in poultry in other countries around the world including the USA, Canada, Chile and France. Influenza viruses have been shown to infect a great variety of birds. In poultry, influenza causes two distinct clinical forms: highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) and low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI). HPAI leads to serious disease in almost all poultry species resulting in large numbers of deaths. It is caused by some viruses of H5 or H7 subtypes. LPAI viruses belong to all H subtypes and only cause mild limited infection.   The UK maintains a programme of surveillance of avian influenza in domestic poultry and wild birds found dead. When statutory notifiable avian disease is confirmed action to confine and stamp out disease includes movement controls on susceptible species in the area around  the premises, enhanced biosecurity, culling of susceptible poultry on the premises  and cleansing and disinfection of the premises."

/government/news/big-society-can-help-tackle-ragwort-risk,"Tackling Common Ragwort can be a practical example of the Big Society in action, Agriculture Minister Jim Paice said today. Big society can help tackle Ragwort risk  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs With the Common Ragwort season in full bloom, Mr Paice is calling on landowners, local groups and nature-lovers to work together to help control the toxic weed. The innocuous yellow flower makes an important contribution to wildlife and biodiversity, and eradication would have a detrimental effect on the environment, but it can have a devastating effect on horses and other animals such as cattle, sheep and donkeys. Mr Paice said: “This little flower may look like a pretty yellow daisy but it spreads easily and can poison horses and other animals - so tackling this problem can be a practical example of the Big Society working together to be part of the solution to control the spread. “Landowners, conservation and community groups can all help by being on the lookout and to help remove this weed, where there’s a risk that livestock will eat it, by following the advice in the ragwort code of practice. “If you’re worried about the risk to your livestock from ragwort on neighbouring land, get in touch with the owner to let them know. And if a local solution can’t be found, you can call Natural England if the problem looks like it’s getting out of hand.” Ragwort is a risk to livestock when it grows in grazing areas, but it also remains poisonous to livestock if inadvertently cut and baled as part of hay for feed. Where ragwort is not causing an issue for livestock and agriculture, it makes a valuable contribution to the countryside by supporting wildlife, such as providing an important habitat for insects like the Cinnabar moth. Guidance on how to identify Common Ragwort and how to control it can be found in the Code of Practice on How to Prevent the Spread of Ragwort, which is available at: archive.defra.gov.uk/wildlife-pets/wildlife/management/weeds/index.htm. Anyone concerned about the spread of Common Ragwort should get in touch with the landowner or manager of the land on which the weed is growing and ask them to take action to control it. If the problem persists, a complaint can be made to Natural England which will investigate it where there is a risk to animal welfare and agricultural activities. Key Facts: Common Ragwort remains toxic when sprayed, cut, dug or pulled Once cut, the flower can set seed Seeds remain viable and can be easily dispersed In its fresh state (unwilted) is difficult to burn Is bulky to transport Can only be composted in controlled conditions Should only be transported in sealed bags/containers Notes Common Ragwort (Senecio jacobaea) is one of five injurious weeds specified in the Weeds Act 1959. If eaten, ragwort causes long-term cumulative liver damage in livestock and other animals, and can have potentially fatal consequences. Exact numbers of deaths are difficult to determine as the liver needs to be dissected. The provisions of the Weeds Act 1959 only apply to Common Ragwort and do not apply to other ragwort species. Other species of ragwort may be equally toxic to horses or other livestock but are less common or relatively rare and some species such as Fen Ragwort are protected. The Weeds Act 1959 empowers the Secretary of State to take action to prevent the spread of Common Ragwort and the other four injurious weeds covered by the Act (Creeping or Field Thistle, Spear Thistle, Curled Dock and Broad-Leaved Dock). Common Ragwort is the only one of the five specified weeds which is harmful to equines and other animals. Natural England, on Defra’s behalf, investigates complaints about ragwort and the other injurious weeds where there is a threat to land used for keeping or grazing of horses and other animals, land used for the production of conserved forage and other agricultural activities. In all cases, Natural England would expect the complainant to have made contact with the owner/occupier of the land on which the weeds are growing to resolve the matter informally, before making a complaint to Natural England.

/government/news/equine-infectious-anaemia-detected-in-a-horse,"Equine infectious anaemia (EIA) has been detected in a horse in Northumberland following importation from the Netherlands, Defra confirmed today. Equine infectious anaemia detected in a horse  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs The premises is currently under restriction and the infected horse will be humanely destroyed in line with existing regulations.  The other horses on the premises are currently subject to epidemiological investigation. The horse arrived in a group of six horses originating in the Netherlands and all have been tested for EIA as part of routine post-import testing. The other five horses in the group have all tested negative. Chief Veterinary Officer Nigel Gibbens said: “This again shows the success of our post import testing regime. These were apparently healthy horses carrying a notifiable disease that we are keen to keep out of Great Britain. After considering the risk I have decided to take appropriate action and humanely destroy this horse.” Notes Equine Infectious Anaemia is a virus disease of horses causing intermittent fever, anaemia, emaciation and death. It can be transmitted by the exchange of  blood by biting insects and occurs typically in low-lying swampy areas. EIA is not a zoonotic disease, The Health Protection Agency advice is that EIA is not a risk to human health and that there is no evidence that this outbreak presents a risk to the local community. A notifiable disease is a disease named in section 88 of the Animal Health Act 1981 or an Order made under that Act and must be reported. This disease occurs in horses, mules and donkeys. Animals may be acutely, chronically or subclinically affected. The incubation period is variable, from a matter of days to a few months but generally one to three weeks. Antibodies usually develop seven to 14 days after infection and last for life. For an animal testing positively for EIA, the only course of action is to humanely put it down. This may be for the welfare of the affected horse, but also to protect other horses from infection. Once infected, horses are infected for life and can pose a risk to other horses in close proximity. We have agreed with equine industry veterinary surgeons that destruction is the only policy. This response is in accordance with both the Infectious Disease of Horses Order 1987 and the Specified Disease (Notification and Slaughter) Order 2006.

The truth : Natural England’s advice has been in the public domain for over six months. We took on board all comments received in response to the consultation on licensing and they contributed to the final policy.  Culling will only take place in the localised areas where it will make a difference, the number of licences to cull badgers will be limited, the licence will specify the maximum number of badgers that can be controlled, and the number of animals controlled will be monitored to guard against local disappearance. Nobody wants to cull badgers.

The grants, which have been awarded to those… Government gives a £2 million boost to tackling air pollution  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Defra have awarded £2 million worth of air quality grants to 36 local authorities across England. The grants, which have been awarded to those authorities who have demonstrated innovative plans to tackle air pollution in our towns and cities, will fund 42 projects all over the country. In particular, funding has been provided to support the investigation of Low Emission Zones, and to help create guidance and tools for local authorities who want to decrease emissions. Money has also been given to authorities who want to develop the way they communicate air quality messages to their local communities. Environment Minister Lord de Mauley said: “Air quality has improved significantly in recent years; however, we need to keep striving to improve the air we breathe. This £2 million air quality grant will help local communities take matters into their own hands. Without this money, many innovative projects would never see the light of day. “In previous years, similar grants have been used very creatively to address air pollution. This is exactly the type of action that should be encouraged and I’m looking forward to reviewing the success of the projects this time next year.” An emphasis was placed on projects that could secure additional funding from other sources, so as to strengthen the project outcomes and ensure cost-effectiveness. The authorities who receive funding will need to provide Defra with a progress report by Autumn 2013, so that the success of each project can be monitored and to show how the money is being spent. The air quality grant programme is now in its fifteenth year and so far over £50 million in grants has been given to support local air quality actions across England. **Notes ** This grant scheme operates under Section 31 of the Local Government Act 2003. The criteria for the grant period 2012/13 was similar to last year’s in that it focused in the main on supporting projects which tackle nitrogen dioxide emissions.

This plan outlines the roles and responsibilities, systems and structures in place for responding to an outbreak of exotic notifiable animal disease, the plan also highlights our working on preparing for disease outbreaks. The latest version of the Contingency Plan for Exotic Notifiable Diseases of Animals is now a single document (compared to previous versions when the Plan comprised of a Framework Response document and a Preparedness Document). It is hoped that the simplified document provides a clear overview of our response to an outbreak of animal disease. Please note that the draft Plan also reflects the fact that Animal Health and the Veterinary Laboratories Agency will be merging on 1 April 2011. The Plan is issued by Animal Health on behalf of Defra and applies to England only. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland develop similar plans which reflect these arrangements within the Devolved Administration’s structures. In addition this year the four Countries will be jointly producing an additional overview Plan (which will reflect the policy and details in the individual Plans) to provide an overview of response to Exotic Notifiable disease at the UK level."

/government/publications/ifca-byelaw-guidance,"Defra has produced the following guidance for IFCAs to help them understand and fulfil their role. IFCA byelaw guidance  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs If you’d like further information, email ifca.contact@defra.gsi.gov.uk. Background The Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009 has modernised the way that inshore sea fisheries resources are managed in England by replacing Sea Fisheries Committees with Inshore Fisheries and Conservation Authorities (IFCAs) from April 2011. What are IFCAs? IFCAs are either committees or joint committees of the local authorities that fall within an IFC district. They are tasked with the sustainable management of inshore sea fisheries resources in their local area. They are made up of representatives from the constituent local authorities (who provide funding for the IFCA) along with people from across the different sectors that use or are knowledgeable about the inshore marine area, such as commercial and recreational fishermen, environmental groups and marine researchers, who offer their time voluntarily. The Marine Management Organisation, Environment Agency and Natural England also each have a statutory seat on the IFCA. Through their local management and funding structures, IFCAs help put local authorities, local communities, local businesses and individual citizens in the driving seat, allowing them to play a bigger part in the protection and enhancement of their inshore marine environment. IFCA vision IFCAs aim to “lead, champion and manage a sustainable marine environment and inshore fisheries, by successfully securing the right balance between social, environmental and economic benefits to ensure healthy seas, sustainable fisheries and a viable industry”. IFC districts Each IFCA manages a district that covers part of the English coast that goes out to six nautical miles and its inland boundaries align with those of its constituent local authorities. IFCAs also manage sea fisheries resources in estuaries that fall within their districts. There are ten IFC districts, with their corresponding IFCAs, in England. These are: North Western IFCA and district Northumberland IFCA and district North Eastern IFCA and district Eastern IFCA and district Kent and Essex IFCA and district Sussex IFCA and district Southern IFCA and district Devon and Severn IFCA and district Cornwall IFCA and district, and Isles of Scilly IFCA and district"

/government/case-studies/peak-district-national-park-an-example-of-a-flourishing-business,"Each year, there are nearly 90 million visitors to the English National Parks, contributing £4 billion to the parks and surrounding areas. Peak District National Park: an example of a flourishing business  Peak District National Park Authority Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Two years ago Cheryl Ashton and her husband decided to bite the bullet and quit their day jobs in order to focus on their first love; cycling. The opportunity fell into their laps, when a sign was put up outside their cottage in the Peak district near Bakewell, advising of plans to convert a nearby railway line into a trail route for ramblers and cyclists. Cheryl says: “We immediately rang the number on the sign and found out we had two weeks to put a business plan together for a Defra-funded local grant.” The gamble has paid off because two years later, their Blackwell Mills Cycle Centre has doubled in visitors. They operate from the heart of the Monsal Trail in the Derbyshire Peak District and with the help of the grant they were able to buy stock and convert a garage into the cycle centre. The route itself is really accessible and gives tourists, cycle enthusiasts and ramblers access to eight miles of the disused railway line which takes in old tunnels and breath-taking gorges. The Ashton’s are business savvy, Cheryl worked for several years in insurance sales and her husband worked for the RAC and is a bike enthusiast which means expert maintenance is on hand. “I have set up a website and I have printed maps of the route on all our publicity material. I make sure I’m endorsing local business such as pubs on the route, and they in turn support me. The local campsite has my details on their website and that really helps with signposting customers our way” says Cheryl. The downside of the business is that it is weather dependent and they were originally given planning permission for to operate for 8 months of the year. Cheryl says that is something they need to change because an uncertain weather pattern means that they need to be flexible. “Last November, for instance was really mild and we could have stayed open. By contrast we had a very cold, rainy March which meant that we had a slow start.” That said they are making up for it with a good summer and are signposting families to crucial ice-cream vendors.

Rural growth: The success of North York Moors based 'Ginger Pig'  North York Moors National Park Authority Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs The growth of The Ginger Pig has been a product of Tim Wilson’s passion for traditional animals and butchery, and revolutionary natural farming strategy. The company now has six London shops, farms over 3,000 acres of farm and moorland, works with a network of like-minded farming partners and employs approximately 80 members of staff. In 2003, Tim Wilson applied for a Defra grant to help up-scale his production to bigger premises. The company is considered to be one of the most reputable small food and farming businesses in the country; Tim puts its success down to a commitment to impeccable animal welfare, good people and traditional butchery methods. The Ginger Pig operates from an 18th century farmhouse in the North York Moors village of Levisham and is the beating heart of the business, employing over 30 people to manage the farmland and run the butchery, bakery, preserving kitchen and head office. This team supports a 50-strong network of master butchers, cooks and counter staff in London, who serve the areas of Marylebone, Shepherd’s Bush, London Bridge, Hackney, Waterloo and Clapham via the company’s retail shops. One of the most popular products is their traditional sausage roll; a ballast of rich, pork sausage meat encased within a crust of home-made pastry. Their beef graces the tables of one of the capital’s most renowned and successful steakhouses including The Hawksmoor, Aqua Shard, The Clove Club and Racine. The company began offering butchery lessons to the public several years ago, long before public interest in food was at the level we see now. The small classes run seven nights a week and are booked up for weeks in advance; students come from all walks of life and share a common enthusiasm for hands-on butchery and food preparation. Tim and his business enterprise took a gamble within the food industry; opening butchers shops when thousands were closing due to the consumer shift towards the supermarkets, standing by their core values of quality and animal welfare when many were seeking the cheapest possible product. The Ginger Pig delivers beef to butchers in Belgium and Paris, and a handful of restaurants also in Paris. The business has registered interest from even further afield; the improved production and butchery facilities will allow the company to capitalise on this interest in British produce, both on British soil and from further field."

/government/news/badger-cull-extension-application-in-somerset,"The badger cull pilot cull in Somerset has finished. An application has been submitted by the company for a short extension. Badger cull extension application in Somerset  Natural England Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs The Somerset pilot badger cull has now completed. Current indications suggest that the pilot has been safe, humane and effective in delivering a reduction in the badger population of just under 60 per cent. The Chief Veterinary Officer has advised that this reduction will deliver clear disease benefits as part of a four year cull. Natural England is currently considering an application from the cull company for a short extension of two to three weeks so as to maximise the disease control benefits achieved in this first year. We expect Natural England to make a decision on the application to extend the application in the next few days. The advice of the Chief Veterinary Officer is that further increasing the number of badgers culled would improve those benefits even further and enable them to accrue earlier. Immediately prior to the start of the two pilots, extensive hair trapping took place in both areas to provide a robust and up to date estimate of the badger population within the two cull areas. The results of this latest hair-trapping exercise show that the estimated number of badgers is significantly fewer in both areas compared to last summer when the last hair-trapping was done. In Somerset the latest population estimate is 1,450 compared to 2,400 last year, and in Gloucestershire 2,350 compared to 3,400. We understand that the cull company in Gloucestershire will also be applying for a licence extension to Natural England today.

In the six weeks of the the pilot cull 708 badgers were removed. This represents just over 30 per cent of the revised local badger population of 2,350. The Chief Veterinary Officer has advised that the period of culling this year should be extended to achieve the earliest and greatest possible impact on bovine TB in Gloucestershire. Natural England is therefore considering an application for an extension from the cull company in Gloucestershire. The pilot culls in Gloucestershire and Somerset have been testing the safety, humaneness and effectiveness of controlled shooting as a means of reducing badger numbers and therefore reducing the high levels of disease in these areas. The early indications from Gloucestershire are that, as in Somerset, the pilot has been safe and humane.

/government/news/gloucestershire-badger-cull-ends,"The cull company and Natural England agreed to stop the cull on Saturday 30 November. Gloucestershire badger cull ends  Natural England Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Culling operations ceased on Saturday 30 November, following discussions between the cull company in West Gloucestershire, Natural England and the NFU that the license for the extension would end. The decision was taken based on the decreasing number of badgers seen by contractors over recent weeks which made achieving a further significant reduction in the coming weeks unlikely. Figures show that in the additional 5 weeks and 3 days of culling, 213 badgers have been removed, giving an overall total of 921. This represents a reduction of just under 40% in the estimated badger population before culling began. The Independent Panel of Experts will now consider the information collected during the pilots on the safety, effectiveness and humaneness of controlled shooting. This will inform decisions on the wider roll-out of badger control in those parts of England most severely affected by this disease. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson said in a statement to parliament: “The aim of the extension was to achieve the earliest and greatest possible impact on bTB in the area, in line with the Chief Veterinary Officer’s advice that a further significant reduction of the badger population in the first year would increase the likelihood of disease benefits in cattle over the full four years of the cull. “The decision to extend has been shown to be the right one, with significant numbers of badgers removed at the point that the extension was ended.” A written statement is published on the parliament website"

/government/news/new-woodland-boosts-army-training-and-flood-defences,"120 hectares of new woodland at a Yorkshire training area will improve soldiers' experience while reducing flood risk for local residents. New woodland boosts army training and flood defences  Defence Infrastructure Organisation Environment Agency Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs The Defence Infrastructure Organisation ( DIO ) worked with the Forestry Commission and the Woodland Trust to deliver the woodland at Catterick Training Area, which will provide further area for our armed forces to develop skills in using wooded areas as cover in battle. The woodland also meets best practice guidelines set out by the Forestry Commission and Defra , and is part of Woodlands for Water ( WfW ) , an initiative to enhance England’s water environment. Jeremy Kalkowski, DIO ’s head forester for the north eastern UK, said: DIO supports our armed forces by providing what they need to live, work and train. Our cross-organisational working approach means that not only are we providing an improved facility for military training, but there are huge benefits to the people and communities around Catterick, as well as for the biodiversity and environment of the area. WfW was established by the Forestry Commission and the Environment Agency to improve the quality of rivers and help against the causes of downstream flooding in England. Planting on steep hillsides at Catterick reduces ground water flowing into the River Swale. In the last few years, large areas within the north east of England have been subject to flooding. It is hoped that the new woodland will help reduce the effects of flooding in the area. Tenant farmers on Ministry of Defence ( MOD ) land at Catterick were able to apply for the Forestry Commission’s grant scheme, which covered their costs for planting 80 hectares of trees. Jeremy Dick, the local woodland officer for the Forestry Commission, said: The commission established the Woodlands for Water initiative with the Environment Agency in 2010. It’s great to see this project come to fruition where the scale and location of planting means reducing the flood risk. 120 hectares is a really good contribution towards our national woodland creation target. The remaining 40 hectares are also being funded by WfW and the Woodland Trust. This means that no costs were incurred on the defence budget for the training ground. Woodland Trust partnership manager Helen Chesshire said: We are delighted to continue our partnership with DIO and create new native woodland across the MOD estate for both the benefit of the environment and the armed forces. In addition to the planting at Catterick our partnership has created over 380 hectares of new native woodland at 6 other MOD sites, with a further 100 hectares to be planted in the autumn at 3 more sites. The 120 hectare planting at Catterick is part of a wider woodland creation drive on the MOD ’s training estate. Wherever possible, DIO seeks to use public funds to develop projects that meet the needs of multiple organisations, departments and local communities."

Darwin Plus grant: Bermuda invasive lionfish initiative  Department for International Development Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Foreign & Commonwealth Office The invasive lionfish threatens native populations of economically and ecologically important fish species and impacts the overall health of coral reef ecosystems. Controlling the spread of this invasive species in Bermuda’s waters is vital to minimising these impacts. This includes impacts on fisheries, tourism, and public health. Reducing the invasive species The project funded by Darwin Plus is providing important scientific data for the development and implementation of an island-wide management plan. This includes information on lionfish abundance and distribution, feeding ecology, and population dynamics. The project is hoping to develop a lionfish-specific trap to help with the large-scale, long-term removal of the species from deeper waters that are more difficult to reach. The team has conducted surveys of lionfish and prey fish to understand diet preferences, demography, and population genetics. The data will be used to develop a model of the Bermuda lionfish population to highlight areas for targeted removal and management in the future. This cooperative team has made great strides toward furthering our understanding of lionfish ecology and population demography in Bermuda’s waters. The Bermuda Invasive Lionfish Control Initiative project will generate the tools and data required for the implementation of the Bermuda Lionfish Control Plan. This plan will provide strategies for government and other stakeholders to control the lionfish population at a level that will reduce the long-term impact of this invasive species on native fishes, reef communities, the island’s economy and public health. Darwin support to the UK Overseas Territories The purpose of the Darwin Plus Fund is broad and incorporates biodiversity, conservation and climate-related issues. Funding for the Bermuda Invasive Lionfish Control Initiative was awarded during the first round of funding."
/government/case-studies/darwin-grant-protecting-elephants-and-promoting-peace-in-mali,"Darwin Initiative supports communities in Mali to better manage their environment, conserve elephants and help people Darwin grant: protecting elephants and promoting peace in Mali  Department for International Development Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Mali is a beautiful, landlocked desert country in North West Africa. Perhaps best known for its rich cultural diversity, Mali is also home to the northernmost herd of African elephants. The survival of these elephants is directly linked to the state of relations between the peoples of the Gourma region. Despite its wealth in natural resources, half of Mali’s population lives below the poverty line ($1.25 a day). This poverty is made worse by instability such as the recent armed conflict. The Darwin funded Mali Elephant Project encourages local communities to work together to reduce environmental damage and protect important habitats. Damage to soils, water, plants and wildlife means that there is less to go round and increases the likelihood of conflict between elephants and humans. Communities who work together to protect and restore their environment are protecting their livelihoods and the habitats the elephants need for their survival. The project works with local groups to protect their environment and encourages communities to work together by providing employment for young people, targeting post-conflict aid and reconstruction activities. Community engagement protects ecosystems In return for protecting the elephant migration route, the project helps the community. This has included providing access to grain and to clean water (through digging wells) and encouraging youth employment and conflict management. All activities include a focus on preventing further ecosystem damage. The project is bringing different people. Working together to protect water, pasture, forests, wildlife and wild foods and using these resources sustainably means that more of the environment is protected. A forum for resource management A group was established to promote more sustainable management of the environment. Its first action was to designate a 923,800 hectare reserve to protect pasture throughout the dry season. Protected by the community-built fire-breaks, this was the only part of the northern range that did not lose its pasture in bush fires. Other communities are asking to join the process, and the Darwin grant will help extend the approach to other communities throughout the elephant range. We don’t want the elephants to disappear because if the elephants disappear it means the environment is no longer good for us. Malian villager"

/guidance/uk-pollutant-release-and-transfer-register-prtr-data-sets,"How to query UK data on waste transfers and emissions, by specific substance, area, river basin, industry or economic sector. UK Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (PRTR) data sets  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Overview Pollutants are defined as ‘substances that may be harmful to the environment or to human health on account of their properties and their introduction into the environment’. Pollutant release and transfer registers ( PRTRs ) are inventories of pollution from industrial sites and other sources. A PRTR is a national or regional environmental database or inventory of potentially hazardous chemical substances and/or pollutants released to air, water and soil and transferred off-site for treatment or disposal. Annex I of the European Union Regulation on PRTRs specifies which activities need to report. In some cases, these activities are further sub-divided. The industrial or business facilities quantify and report the amounts of substances released to each environmental medium (air, water, soil) or transferred off-site for waste management or wastewater treatment. The 2003 Kiev Protocol on PRTRs requires parties to the agreement to make this information publicly accessible. Information shown in the PRTR data sets Displayed data includes: facility, including the facility’s parent company where applicable, and its geographical location, including the river basin activity pollutant or waste, as appropriate each environmental medium (air, water, land) into which the pollutant is released off-site transfers of waste and their destination, as appropriate off-site transfers of pollutants in waste water period trends (time series) displayed using graphs Features include: view current and previous records for each pollutant release using the time series feature view records of each release from each activity/all activities view each site’s release and transfer record and use graphs to assess trends view release and transfer trends in graphs from 2007 interactively access data and view facility location using Google Earth (needs Google Earth application) compare release and transfer data from 2007 compare release information using river basin districts and area view the destination of hazardous waste transferred out of the UK view waste data from industrial activities in graphs and tables download data in complete blocks, for example, by using activity headings with supporting facility level information Publication of datasets Defra aims to publish data approximately one year after the end of the calendar year under report. For example, data for the 2013 report cycle is likely to be available by the end of 2014 and in that order for subsequent years. Reliability and validity PRTR data is provided by operators who submit their annual emission and waste data to the appropriate regulator. A number of quality checks are built into the data collection and reporting processes. These include cross referencing information contained in permits with operator-reported PRTR data, using information from inspections and monitoring regimes to validate reported data, scrutinising and validating data from each operator for omissions, errors and/or incomplete information. Nonetheless, quality assurance is an ongoing exercise and is kept under regular review. The PRTR regulation places the responsibility for data collection on the operator. The operator has a legal responsibility to monitor substances that are released during the course of operation of an installation using a variety of methods as specified in the operating permit and sector guidance. These are then reported to the regulators who compile and check the information before it is published online. The EU’s PRTR regulation and the UN ECE PRTR protocol specify which industrial activities are included for reporting purposes and their associated thresholds. This means that an installation whose details are not shown on the site have not reached the stated thresholds and therefore do not have to be included. Also, for installations shown but where the threshold for reporting for a pollutant is not reached or where there has been no release, no data for the pollutant will be shown. Search the PRTR database on your chosen parameters The database lists data on 91 pollutants, such as amount released, when and where, based on reports from facilities that have reached the required threshold for inclusion. The search tool lets you perform queries on this data including: search by facility , including the facility name, parent company, location or postcode search by activity , including energy, metals, minerals, chemicals, waste management, paper and wood, farming, food and ‘other’ search by economic sector , as defined by NACE search by pollutant , including pesticides, greenhouse gases, metals etc search by waste type and treatment , including hazardous, transboundary, disposal etc search by each environmental medium (air, water, land) into which the pollutant is released You can also search for time comparisons of: pollutant releases pollutant transfers waste transfers Pollutant release data for diffuse sources The emission of pollutants from the sectors covered by PRTR are typically referred to as ‘point source’ data, because emissions can be tied to a specific facility or site of operation. Diffuse emissions occur when the source of emission is more difficult to place at a specific geographic location, or where the nature of the activity that generates the emission is scattered amongst multiple small scale sites which are difficult to quantify. A good example of what can be considered diffuse emissions within the UK PRTR will include the following broad emission groups: emissions from road transport vehicles emissions from accidental building and vehicle fires emissions from combustion in domestic grates emissions from bonfires The National Atmospheric Emissions Inventory (NAEI) website contains data for diffuse sources. Pollutants and thresholds list You can check the list of pollutants by name and chemical composition for information about environmental impact, effect on human health and current level of control. You can switch to the thresholds view to see the different thresholds for reporting against each pollutant with in the UK PRTR . Methods for obtaining data The data is calculated (C), estimated (E) or measured (M) by the operator. Data reporting method may also be unspecified (U). Within the calculated and measured categories, there are sub-categories which each have their own code.

The Grant Programme for 2014/15 has focused on supporting projects set up to tackle nitrogen dioxide levels and mitigate emissions from road transport. Successful projects include £40,000 to upgrade cycle and pedestrian links across the A458 in Dudley; £21,820 on cycling infrastructure in Cheshire; £20,800 to promote electric vehicles in Bristol and £31,000 to build a business case for gas buses in Leicester. Environment Minister Dan Rogerson said: “Air quality has improved significantly in recent decades and local authorities play a vital role – funding these great projects across the country will help them to continue this good work. I look forward to seeing how these projects will deliver real benefits for communities across England.” Other examples of projects receiving funding include £50,000 to trial converting container stacking machines from diesel to natural gas in Southampton; £31,320 on subway improvements in Hertfordshire and £29,100 on cycle path upgrades in Watford. It is hoped this grant will help reduce air pollution and raise awareness of the ongoing work between the UK government, local authorities and the European Commission to further improve air quality.

/government/news/350-earth-climate-art-project,"24 November 2010  Thom Yorke, lead-singer of the band Radiohead, added his voice today to the growing chorus of artists supporting this coming… 350 EARTH climate art project  Closed organisation: Department of Energy & Climate Change 24 November 2010 Thom Yorke, lead-singer of the band Radiohead, added his voice today to the growing chorus of artists supporting this coming week’s first-ever planetary art show: 350 EARTH. In the week leading up to the UN Climate Meetings in Cancun , artists are working with citizens in more than a dozen locations to create massive, climate-themed public art installations that will be photographed by satellites traveling 17,000 m.p.h nearly 400 miles above the surface of the planet. The initiative is being coordinated by the international climate campaign 350.org. Yorke explained on the Radiohead website , “the plan is to make images visible from the skies to remind those in Cancun that we’re running out of time. We can’t keep putting this off.” As part of the project, Yorke is working with 350.org to gather thousands of people on the coastline in Brighton on Saturday, 27 November 27, to form an enormous picture of King Canute, a Norse ruler who futilely tried to control the ocean. The Brighton event is one of a range of public art pieces planned across the world. 350.org will be unveiling the images throughout the week of November 20-27 on the 350 EARTH website and over social media. Hi-resolution satellite photos and aerial images of each art project will also be displayed at the UN Climate Talks in Cancun.

It is critical we secure a legally binding approach on climate change in Durban The lesson the world is learning the hard way from the financial crisis is that there is only one boat and we are all in it. To stay afloat, we need rules tough enough to stop systemic risks becoming systemic collapses. This lesson is as true for the environment as it is for the economy. A key battle in the campaign to build an effective system of global rules will shortly take place in Durban, where the UN climate negotiations reopen at the end of this month. The International Energy Agency has set the scene, with the timely warning in its new World Energy Outlook that we are way off track to avoid dangerous climate change, and that the window for effective action is closing fast. It is fashionable to argue that a new climate treaty, based on the Kyoto architecture of legally binding carbon caps, is dead. We should, on this view, give Kyoto a decent burial and switch to plan B. This turns out to be a looser arrangement in which governments make voluntary pledges to each other. Its advocates often call themselves “realists”. The case for voluntarism was first put by those who want to try less hard to deal with climate change. It has subsequently attracted support from academics and other commentators whose concern - indeed alarm - about the climate is unquestionable. They may be desperate rather than cynical, but they tend to know more about the climate than they do about diplomacy. The problem is in the politics not the architecture. The choice between what needs to be done but looks impossible, and what can be done but is clearly not enough, is as old as history. It lay behind the struggle between Churchill and Halifax as Britain faced Hitler’s tanks on the Channel coast. Nato’s success in Libya was conducted against a barrage of predictions that it would lead to years of stalemate. When there is no alternative, realism lies in expanding the limits of the possible, not in nourishing the delusion that something else might help. There really is no plan B for the climate. A voluntary framework will not be enough to keep us within the 2C limit of manageable climate change. Unmanageable climate change will precipitate systemic collapses, including of our food and water security. Success or failure will depend on governments convincing investors that they are determined to enact the policies necessary to drive private capital towards a low-carbon future. In the boardroom a voluntary pledge from a government sounds rather like “maybe”. That’s why in the UK we have set legally binding carbon budgets through the Climate Change Act. If a legally binding approach, including a round of post-2012 Kyoto commitments, falls off the table at Durban, most would see this as giving up on climate change. They would be right. The Kyoto protocol is arguably the EU’s greatest diplomatic achievement. It inspired the world’s largest single market to take big steps towards a carbon neutral energy system, making our economies stronger and more resilient on the way. Europeans should be proud of this approach, not embarrassed by it, even if some of our global partners are not yet ready to embrace it. It is true that the current cycle of Kyoto commitments only covers industrialised countries, and that some of those outside the EU are reluctant to take on new commitments. Many rightly argue that an effective regime must bind all major economies, not only the EU and those in its orbit. But we do not need this all at once any more than we needed to include everyone from the start to make the GATT work. Durban needs to send a clear signal that the world is moving rapidly in this direction and that as soon as countries become sufficiently prosperous they will accept binding caps. The deal that is both available and essential must include a second phase of Kyoto commitments for those willing to accept them, plus an unambiguous “commitment to commit” by 2020 from the other major players. This would at last unblock the path to a binding regime with full participation. Voluntary pledges alone will not keep the global economy open, drive trade and investment, maintain financial stability, or protect peoples against food, water and energy insecurity. If we cannot summon the will to make hard promises on climate change - the first challenge we have ever faced that will affect literally everyone - it will become much harder to do so on everything else. It’s no surprise that such a complex enterprise is taking time to accomplish. The great achievements in the continuing effort to secure our mutual interests by agreeing global rules - the multilateral trade system, the regimes for arms control and nuclear non-proliferation, the European single market, the international criminal court - all took time and many steps to bring to maturity. True, on this occasion we can’t afford to take as long as some of these projects did, and we cannot wait for conflict to concentrate our minds. But there is no fundamental obstacle. The technology and capital are available. The framework we need is not only compatible with the economic needs of the major economies but essential to securing them. Arnold Toynbee warned that technology was giving us the power to destroy ourselves. If we could see through the fog of current events, we might discern a fork ahead. One path points towards chronic insecurity and conflict; the other offers a prospect of co-operation and mutual prosperity. The choice between these two paths that will be foreshadowed at Durban.

I have been updating Ministers and other organisations routinely on progress. “This is an independent role for which I have established an Operations Control Unit (OCU) consisting of a full team of experts to advise me, including independent technical specialists. The team, which includes the Department of Energy and Climate Change, the Maritime and Coastguard Agency and Marine Scotland, has been co-located at Shell’s office in Aberdeen and we are working very closely with the company. “Based on the latest intelligence that I have, my view is that the oil leak is under control and has now been greatly reduced as validated by remotely operated vehicle footage and Government aerial surveillance flights. The priority now and over the coming days is to completely halt any further leakage in what is a complex environment. “Although the spill was deemed as significant, our information is still that the oil is not expected to reach the shore, and that it will be dispersed naturally. “It will be for DECC and the HSE inspectors to thoroughly investigate the causes of this incident, and once the full report is completed, it will be sent the Scottish Procurator Fiscal who will consider it and make a decision on further action.”"

/government/case-studies/global-threat-reduction-programme-coalition-of-nuclear-centres-and-partners,"The creation of alternative job opportunities for former Soviet nuclear weapons personnel. Global Threat Reduction Programme: Coalition of Nuclear Centres and Partners  Closed organisation: Department of Energy & Climate Change The Global Partnership’s original priorities acknowledged that unemployed former Soviet nuclear weapons scientists and technicians possess knowledge of, and / or access to, nuclear technology and materials which could be of value to a proliferating state or to terrorist organisations. Since the break-up of the Soviet Union in the 1990s, the Closed Nuclear Cities (ten centres of nuclear weapons research, production and maintenance) in Russia, and a number of nuclear institutes in former Soviet Union states (Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Armenia, Georgia and Belarus) have seen large-scale job losses and a lack of investment. The Coalition of Nuclear Centres and Partners( CNCP ) was established to counter this proliferation risk by supporting the creation of meaningful alternative job opportunities for former Soviet nuclear weapons personnel. CNCP achieves its goals by providing: investment grants for commercial civil sector projects training for personnel, including study tours to the UK to share experiences assistance in the establishment of commercial partnerships with UK companies support for sustainable local economic development in the cities and institutes To support networking and to publicise its activities, CNCP runs an active website and produces a regular newsletter. CNCP is expected to exceed its objectives to create up to 3,000 lasting jobs by 2012, and for at least 55% of these to be for former nuclear weapons scientists and technicians (the current figure is around 65%). The final investment grants for new projects were made in March 2010 in order to allow for up to two years of support to grant beneficiaries prior to the Programme’s planned completion in 2012, with efforts focused on improving outcomes and their long-term sustainability. Through the CNCP , the UK has been able to share its considerable domestic experience of defence downsizing and restructuring, as well as the lessons learned from the earlier Global Threat Reduction Programme initiative addressing the Social and Economic Consequences of Nuclear Power Plant Closure in Lithuania, Bulgaria and the Slovak Republic. In 2010, Canada contributed C$1.5 million to CNCP , in a ‘piggybacking’ arrangement that has been widely and successfully used throughout the Global Partnership. The Canadian funded work programme will enable further job creation and help support the establishment of a sustainable infrastructure. CNCP in the Russian Federation CNCP is working in six closed cities: Novouralsk, Ozersk, Sarov, Seversk, Snezhinsk and Zheleznogorsk. A total of 2,345 jobs are planned to be created by 2012. Examples of job creation include: Zheleznogorsk: 71 new jobs (42 filled by former employees from the city’s plutonium production plant) created through funding to help an existing company to extend development and production of its energy-efficient heating units for residential, public and industrial buildings Sarov: 10 new jobs created for former weapons personnel from the city’s Soviet nuclear weapons research establishment, through funding enabling an existing spin-off business to expand production of vibration control and monitoring systems, the uses of which include measuring vibration in power plant turbines and generators CNCP in Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan Across the former Soviet Union there are thought to be around 3,000 nuclear specialists possessing proliferation-sensitive knowledge. Most have poor career prospects and work for low salaries, with minimal prospects of securing legitimate, properly-remunerated and satisfying alternative employment. The UK is supporting projects at nuclear institutes in Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan. A total of 751 jobs are planned to be created by 2012."

Global Threat Reduction Programme: Shut down of Soviet plutonium-producing reactor at Aktau  Closed organisation: Department of Energy & Climate Change Kazakhstan was a Soviet prototype sodium-cooled fast breeder reactor that operated between 1973 and 1999. Because of its potential to produce weapons-grade plutonium, a key non-proliferation aim has been to reach an irreversible stage in the decommissioning of the reactor. This was achieved in 2009 with the completion of the passivation of residual sodium in the coolant circuits. In November 2010, working with the US Department of Energy and Kazakhstan, the (Global Threat Reduction Programme) GTRP completed the transfer of ten tons of highly enriched uranium and three tons of plutonium (enough material for 775 nuclear weapons) to safe and secure storage under International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards at the former Soviet nuclear weapons test site at Semipalatinsk in North East Kazakhstan. The focus is now on dealing with other radioactive and chemically hazardous materials, including the large inventory of liquid metal coolant. GTRP ’s assistance at Aktau has made use of the UK’s own experience in the ongoing decommissioning of the fast reactors at Dounreay, Scotland.The UK will wind up its technical support at Aktau, including the completion of radiological surveys to confirm that no fissile material has been left behind, over the course of 2011."

Written ministerial statement by John Hayes on the European opt in decision on nuclear liability  Closed organisation: Department of Energy & Climate Change The UK has opted in to the proposal for a Council Decision on ratification of the 1997 Protocol amending the Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage of 21 May 1963 (“the Vienna Convention”). The proposal meets the criteria set out in the Coalition Agreement with regard to EU justice and home affairs measures. In particular, the Government considers that it is in the UK’s interest to opt into the proposal because it will be of general benefit to EU citizens but it will not create any obligations in the UK. The proposed Decision authorises Member States which are Contracting Parties to the Vienna Convention to ratify the Protocol of 12 September 1997 amending the Vienna Convention in the interest of the European Union, or to accede to it. The Vienna Convention was established to ensure fair and adequate compensation is available in the event of a nuclear accident. The Protocol amendments will be beneficial to potential victims of nuclear accidents for which nuclear operators in States that are Contracting Parties to the Vienna Convention are responsible. In particular, they mean that an increased amount of compensation will be available in respect of a broader range of damage across a wider geographical area. The proposal will only apply to Member States that are party to the Vienna Convention i.e. Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Lithuania, Slovakia and Poland (Latvia and Romania have already ratified the 1997 Protocol). The proposal will not apply to the UK which is party to another international convention on liability for nuclear damage – the Paris Convention on Third Party Liability in the Field of Nuclear Energy of 29 July 1960 as amended - which is based on similar principles to the Vienna Convention."

/government/news/scheme-brings-50m-power-bill-saving-across-north-scotland,"UK Energy and Climate Change Secretary Edward Davey visits Aberdeen Scheme brings £50m power bill saving across north Scotland  Closed organisation: Department of Energy & Climate Change Press notice: 13/022 A scheme supporting consumers in the North of Scotland exposed to the highest electricity distribution costs in Great Britain is likely to be retained, under plans set out by Edward Davey in a call for comments published today. The scheme - called the Hydro Benefit Replacement Scheme - saves a total of £50 million on energy bills across the North of Scotland. Around a third of this amount contributes to an average bill saving of £31 a year to 690,000 domestic consumers in the north of Scotland, with the rest giving bill savings to the 70,000 non-domestic consumers. It is paid for by all domestic and non-domestic consumers across Great Britain, and costs the average household less than £1 a year. UK Energy and Climate Change Secretary Edward Davey said: “This scheme is another example of how Scotland currently benefits from being part of the United Kingdom, providing an annual saving of £31 to 690,000 domestic consumers in the north of Scotland. “With the size of the Great Britain consumer base we are able to spread the cost of protecting consumers in the North of Scotland. “I believe wholeheartedly that Scotland is stronger as part of the UK, and that the UK is stronger with Scotland in it.” UK Energy Minister John Hayes added: “This scheme cushions consumers in the North of Scotland from the high costs of distributing electricity over a sparsely populated area. It shows that as one nation with a shared energy market, the British are stronger together. “We are proposing to retain this scheme so that consumers in the North of Scotland will continue to receive this discount.” The Government also plans to retain a second scheme - the Common Tariff Obligation. This scheme prohibits suppliers from charging comparable consumers different prices on the basis of their location in the North of Scotland, and has been in place since 1990. This announcement comes as Edward Davey begins a visit to Aberdeen. He will call on Talisman Energy and visit ROVOP, who provide underwater vehicles in both the oil and gas and offshore renewable sector. While in the city he will meet with European Commissioner Gunther Oettinger, and at a separate event he will meet with Aberdeen City Council to discuss their long-standing engagement on energy efficiency. In the evening, the Secretary of State will attend an event hosted by Oil & Gas UK and Scottish Renewables to discuss interaction between both sectors and how they can best share good practice. Energy Minister John Hayes will also visit Aberdeen on Monday 4 March. Notes for editors: The Government’s call for comments on the Hydro Benefits Replacement Scheme and Common Tariff Obligation .

John Hayes comment on the closure of Daw Mill colliery  Closed organisation: Department of Energy & Climate Change The Minister for Energy, John Hayes said: “I have written to the unions to express my deep regret that, following a recent serious fire, UK Coal has taken the decision to close Daw Mill colliery. “Our priority during this unsettling time for employees is to ensure that everyone is given our full support. Job Centre Plus, the Skills Funding Agency, BIS West Midlands and local skills bodies are ready to offer their considerable expertise if needed. I know there is an opportunity for some workers to be redeployed at UK Coal’s other deep mines at Thoresby and Kellingley. “Along with my Department, I understand that the company is also working closely with their insurers, suppliers and customers to agree arrangements for the way forward and I welcome this collaborative approach.”"

/government/speeches/speech-by-charles-hendry-mp-at-minex-central-asia,"Trade Envoy to Kazakhstan addresses 4th Mining and Mineral Exploration Forum, Astana, 17 April 2013 Speech by Charles Hendry MP at MINEX Central Asia  Closed organisation: Department of Energy & Climate Change I am delighted to greet participants at the fourth Minex Central Asia, which has already established itself as such an important forum for exchanging expertise and contacts. The mining industry in Kazakhstan is a highly important driver for economic development and growth accounting for some 17% of GDP. This can only rise in the future, given Kazakhstan’s great mineral wealth, export orientation and growing global demand. The sector will also contribute to Kazakhstan’s economic and social objectives, through its contribution to regional development, diversification and jobs creation. Mining currently employs about 120,000 people in Kazakhstan, making it one of the strongest drivers of regional employment. At the same time, Kazakhstan is emerging as an international policy maker in minerals production, requiring it to take a more international approach to standards and strategies. One of the lessons of the past decade is that all countries must continually improve their investment climate and Kazakhstan must be applauded for the steps that have been taken over the last few years through such initiatives as the Prime Ministers Investment Council and Foreign Investors Council. Attracting foreign investment is a competitive business, and to successfully win incoming investment, Kazakhstan needs to provide the investment climate that appeals over that of other nations offering similar opportunities. It is encouraging that the mining law and the subsoil user procurement laws are now subject to review. A producer inevitably faces exposure to revenue risk, such as fluctuating commodity prices, and we need to be aware how these risks might be mitigated within these new laws. It can take anything from 8 to 15 years to take a new large-scale mine from opening discussions and exploration all the way through production. Therefore it is key that this work starts now in Kazakhstan to find the mines that will produce in the 2030’s and beyond, as other mines come to the end of their lifecycles. The next round of exploration to discover these future mines will require the latest technology advances. There is also a need for increased mining education to fully realize Kazakhstan’s domestic mining potential. I of course mention these areas as I believe that new technology and education are areas where the UK can offer real expertise to Kazakhstan. Kazakhstan has had its candidate status for the Extractive Industires Transparency Initiative (EITI) extended until August 2013. EITI aims to set a global standard for transparency in oil, gas and mining. It is a coalition of governments, companies and civil society that provides a standard for companies to publish what they pay and for governments to disclose what they receive, in an effort to make natural resources benefit all. EITI is of benefit to Kazakhstan for many reasons, such as giving international recognition, demonstrating regional leadership, and encouraging further international investment. We hope that the Government of Kazakhstan will continue to engage strongly with this initiative and that in August this year we can celebrate Kazakhstan becoming a member of the EITI family. In the meantime, it is vital that companies operating here work to the highest global standards. Of course, many British companies are already involved with the exciting developments in the mining sector, most in tandem with Kazakhstani partners. These companies offer strong UK and international expertise, built up over many years. We have an excellent track record of project management and delivery and our service and supply chain companies ensure that large and complex projects remain on track. We are well placed to help with the introduction of new technologies in the exploration, production and processing of mineral resources in the utilization of automatic process control systems and in the training and development of personnel according to industry best practice. I am delighted to underline the major commitment of Rio Tinto to the Kazakhstani market. Rio Tinto, the National Company JSC “Kazgeologiya” and MINT have entered into agreements in relation to the formation of an exploration joint venture, focused on exploration, technology and training and this represents the logical next step in the development of a long term strategic partnership. There will be sharing of technology and Rio Tinto will also be involved in training of Kazakh specialists as part of a programme to ensure maximum benefit to Kazakhstan. As well as specialising in many technical areas of mining, the UK is also in the forefront of new developments in mining safety, low carbon technologies and energy efficiency. We also want to add capacity by working closely with Kazakhstan on educational projects, as we recognise that, by increasing the skills base, Kazakhstan can continue to climb ever higher up the value chain. It is good to see strong UK involvement at MINEX alongside major Kazakhstani and international mining companies. I look forward to the contributions of committed and experienced companies such as SRK Consulting, Wardell Armstrong, Rio Tinto, Hambledon Mining, Central Asia Metals and Frontier Mining. I wish the organisers and all participants an interesting and successful event. This is a country with exceptional resources, and we look forward to being trusted, long-term partners, as those resources are developed. Thank you for your attention."

In addition to daily contact with the company we are in regular contact with the union representatives of the work force and other key stakeholders including Members of Parliament. The cross-Government response, coordinated by my officials, has ensured that we have been able to respond to the company’s needs, and help facilitate its financial position. As part of the local response supporting the Daw Mill workforce, BIS East Midlands arranged a further employee-focused event, providing advice and information on entitlements and alternative employment opportunities, in Mansfield on 8th May, which was well attended and positively received. This mirrors the event attended by nearly 200 employees in Arley on 22 March. In addition information compiled by Job Centre Plus has been sent to the Daw Mill workforce with links to information sources and resources both locally and nationally. In relation to the future of the company, and its remaining 2,000 employees, Members will have seen the statement made on 1st May 2013 by Kevin McCullough, Chief Executive for UKCOL in which he advised that the company “continue to work closely with our employees, government, pension funds, the Pensions Regulator, suppliers and customers”. Our priority remains to assist the company’s efforts to ensure that as far as possible the viable parts of the business are maintained, and that those who are regrettably likely to be made redundant following the fire at Daw Mill receive appropriate support."

/government/news/householders-and-businesses-in-n-scotland-to-save-50-million-on-energy-bills,"Hydro Benefit Replacement Scheme to save North of Scotland £50 million a year on their energy bills  Householders and businesses in N. Scotland to save £50 million on energy bills  Closed organisation: Department of Energy & Climate Change Householders and businesses in the North of Scotland are set to save a total of £50 million a year on their energy bills after the Government retains a scheme to help with electricity distribution costs. The Hydro Benefit Replacement Scheme offers protection from the significantly higher distribution costs faced by electricity users in the far north of the country, when compared with other parts of the UK. The Government’s decision comes after a public call for comments on the scheme, which will provide a £36 reduction on an average electricity bill to the 690,000 domestic consumers in the North of Scotland. The 70,000 non-domestic consumers in the region will benefit from the remaining £25 million worth of reductions. The cost of the scheme is paid for by all domestic and non-domestic consumers across Great Britain, costing the average household less than £1 a year. Energy Secretary Edward Davey said: “I’m delighted we’ve managed to keep this important support for households and businesses in the North of Scotland. “The beautiful but sparsely populated and rugged expanse of Northern Scotland means maintaining the electricity network costs much more than other parts of the UK and it is not fair that people from the area should have to shoulder the costs of this. “Thanks to the size of the British energy market we have been able to spread that cost. It is another example of how Scotland benefits from being an integral part of a larger British market.” The Secretary of State for Scotland, Michael Moore said: “Today’s announcement is good news for the North of Scotland. It underlines that the UK Government is not only securing large investments in the flourishing Scottish energy industry but we are ensuring that Scottish consumers and businesses in places like Thurso, Ullapool and Wick are benefiting from spreading the costs of electricity bills across the whole of Britain’s large energy market.” Notes for editors The Government is also retaining a second scheme - the Common Tariff Obligation – which prohibits suppliers from charging comparable domestic consumers different prices on the basis of their location in the North of Scotland. There is a legal requirement for Government to review the Hydro Benefit Replacement Scheme every three years. There is a Ministerial commitment to review the Common Tariff Obligation at the same time.

/government/news/chancellor-intervenes-to-honour-fuel-allowance-benefits-of-ex-miners,"Around 1,500 former mine workers to receive fuel allowance despite mine closure. Chancellor intervenes to honour fuel allowance benefits of ex-miners  HM Treasury Closed organisation: Department of Energy & Climate Change Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, announced that the government will guarantee the concessionary fuel allowance for around 400 mine workers who lost their jobs as a result of the recent restructuring of UK Coal. The government will also guarantee the allowance for around 1,000 retired workers previously employed by the company. In total, around 1,500 former mine workers will be entitled to continue to receive their allowance in the form of cash or coal. They will be entitled to choose up to £1,300 of free coal, or up to £600 cash in lieu of coal per year – in line with the current beneficiaries of the scheme. The National Concessionary Fuel Agreements were put in place between British Coal and mining unions in the 1980s. When the British Coal Corporation was privatised in 1994, the government retained the obligation to provide concessionary fuel to former British Coal workers entitled to it. The concessionary fuel arrangements for UK Coal were funded by UK Coal as part of their inheritance as a successor company. About 69,000 former mine workers or their families receive a fuel allowance from Government each year under the National Concessionary Fuel Scheme. This announcement will mean that a further 1,500 former mine workers, who would otherwise have lost their benefits following the collapse of UK Coal, will now be brought into the scheme. Speaking at Thoresby Colliery in Mansfield, George Osborne said: A number of local MPs brought to my attention that former mine workers were losing their concessionary fuel allowance, through no fault of their own when UK Coal went into administration. I wanted to help and because we are fixing the economy, we can. It is right and fair that we make sure they continue to receive their allowance and that is why we are bringing them into the government scheme.

In October 2008 these liabilities were transferred from the then Department of Trade and Industry to the newly created Department of Energy & Climate Change (DECC). Current responsibilities DECC oversees the following obligations related to coal liabilities originating between 1947 and 1994: coal health compensation claims management of benefits to certain former British Coal employees Bevin Boys veteran badges DECC continues to receive new health compensation claims under common law from former British Coal employees for Noise Induced Hearing Loss and some asbestos related conditions, as well as for the conditions formerly compensated under the schemes that are now closed. Those suffering from Pneumoconiosis may be entitled to make a claim direct under DECC’s Coal Workers Pneumoconiosis Scheme. See coal health compensation claims for further information. Environmental and safety-related liabilities The Coal Authority , which was established in 1994 when the coal industry was privatised, manages the environmental and safety-related liabilities of historical coal mining in the UK. This includes: repairing subsidence damage from old coal mining activity and operating an emergency call-out system to secure coalfield subsidence hazards treating water pollution caused by coal mining through a managed investment programme so that water is protected and improved to ‘good’ status sharing its information, skills and experience to help stakeholders make informed decisions when buying property in former coal mining areas Closed schemes DECC delivered two major schemes of compensation for nearly 800,000 former British Coal employees. These were related to Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and Vibration White Finger (VWF). Both schemes are now closed to new claims but former miners and their families may be able to pursue compensation through common law.

This aims to raise the bathing water status of Summerleaze Beach from ‘good’ to ‘excellent’ by 2015, which will benefit the tourism industry as well as the local community. As part of this project, visitors to Summerleaze beach can instantly get up-to-date information about how clean the water is from an interactive touch-screen display at the entrance. The screen is the first of its kind in England, and gives users a range of information about the water, including the size of the waves and the weekly e-coli and intestinal enterococci results. It also shows the MET office Bude weather forecast, Bude surf reports, Twitter feeds for organisations operating in the area and useful contact numbers. The data is collected by the Environment Agency and made available via their Bathing Water widget as part of a move to open up more government data to the public. Summerleaze beach has also been selected to take part in an Environment Agency short term pollution prediction trial, so the screen has been developed in such a way to display future warnings based on predicted rainfall events. Lucy Hunt, Environment Agency Manager, said: An important part of the new [EU] Bathing Water Directive is how we inform people of quality of water at their beaches. The pilot is a first for us, a chance to see how it will work… It means parents will be able to check conditions before their children go in the water; likewise, surfers and other users.

/government/publications/quantifying-point-source-inputs-of-pesticides-to-river-catchments,"Develops a procedure for reviewing the results of pesticide analysis within a catchment so as to be able to identify short-term events in order to recognise the possible sources of pollution. Quantifying point source inputs of pesticides to river catchments  Environment Agency Pesticide occurrences in rivers may result from diffuse runoff from farmland or from point sources. The former is a possible outcome from usage on crops in a manner, which accords with ‘good agricultural practice’. The latter can arise from discharges to rivers from sewage treatment works or factories, accidental spills, deliberate disposal of surplus material into soakaways or rivers, poor application practices to crops close to rivers, amenity weed control leading directly to drainage systems, or vandalism. Diffuse inputs of pesticides into rivers are not easily reduced, since they are, by definition, physically dispersed. Also as they arise from ‘good agricultural practice’ reductions have to be achieved by alerting farmers and contractors to the issue and advising and persuading on the best ways to avoid waterpollution occurring. Point sources, although difficult to identify and locate, arise from poor management. As they can be reduced or eliminated by making changes to pesticide storage, handling and disposal, they are inherently more amenable to a regulatory approach by Environment Agency staff. A method of reviewing monitoring data to identify those occurrences arising from point sources would assist Agency staff in controlling pesticide pollution."

/government/publications/impact-of-agricultural-soil-conditions-on-floods-autumn-2000,"A targeted survey to investigate the conditions of a range of soils under different cropping systems in selected areas of the large Severn and Yorkshire Ouse catchments.  Impact of agricultural soil conditions on floods: Autumn 2000  Environment Agency The year 2000 was the wettest in Great Britain since records began in the eighteenth century. It has been repeatedly claimed in statements to the media that catchments such as the Severn, Yorkshire Ouse and Medway flooded because they were “saturated” by the first rain storms in October and were unable to absorb more rainfall. Some modern farming practices can lead to a reduction in soil water storage and infiltration capacity, particularly on certain types of soil. These “degraded” soil conditions can reduce the soil’s inherent ability to absorb rain and thus lead to increased runoff to surface waters, particularly during storm events. However, there is little quantified data available to corroborate this possibility. As a consequence, the National Soil Resources Institute (formerly the Soil Survey and Land Research Centre) were commissioned to undertake a targeted survey to investigate the conditions of a range of soils under different cropping systems in selected areas of the large Severn and Yorkshire Ouse catchments and also the smaller catchments of the rivers Uck and Bourne in the south-east of England. The catchments of the Severn and the Yorkshire Ouse were too large to investigate in detail and field visits were therefore focussed on three selected representative 100 km2 areas within each catchment."

The research involved an extensive literature review, two case studies examining appraisal practice within the Environment Agency and workshops with Environment Agency personnel. It has identified that it is appropriate for the Environment Agency to use a twostage approach to integrated appraisal. This should consist of an initial ‘screening’ stage at which potential impacts are identified against a checklist of economic, social and environmental concerns followed by more detailed appraisal of those impacts deemed significant and/or whose investigation is a regulatory obligation for the Environment Agency.

However, deployment of sonar in horizontal mobile surveys is still in the developmental stage, and successive surveys on the same fish populations can produce very variable results. In addition, three types of echosounder are currently in use within the Environment Agency and comparisons between results obtained from different systems are difficult to conduct.

Relationship between the lotic-invertebrate Index for Flow Evaluation (LIFE) and river invertebrate prediction and classification system (RIVPACS)  Environment Agency In the UK, there are competing demands for both surface and groundwater resources. Sustained or repeated periods of low flows and/or slow flows are expected to impact on the plant and animal communities within rivers. To assess the potential impact of flow-related stresses on lotic macroinvertebrate communities, the Environment agency developed the Lotic-invertebrate Index for Flow Evaluation (LIFE). Extence et al. (1999) showed that for several individual sites, temporal variation in LIFE could be correlated with recent and preceding flow conditions. RIVPACS (River InVertebrate Prediction And Classification System) is the principal methodology currently used by the UK government environment agencies to assess the biological condition of UK rivers. RIVPACS assesses biological condition at a site by comparing the observed macroinvertebrate fauna with the fauna expected at the site if it is unstressed and unpolluted, as predicted from its environmental characteristics."

A review of argulus spp. occurring in UK freshwaters  Environment Agency At present there is a serious lack of control measures and management strategies against outbreaks of Argulus, particularly in still water fisheries. Improved chemotherapies, which are acceptable environmentally and in terms of human health, may be developed, but prevention through improved management practices is a more favourable option and may well be the most practical option when dealing with a large open water system. However, in order to successfully identify suitable practices a much better understanding of the parasite is necessary. The current study into the population ecology and epidemiology of Argulus in the UK may lead to the identification of risk factors associated with epizootics of Argulus. Although it is probably not practical to totally eradicate or eliminate populations of Argulus in many stillwater fisheries, it may be possible by the removal of risk factors to keep population numbers at a level that will not cause the major problems associated with an outbreak."

/government/news/kent-coastal-redoubt-protected-once-again,"Prompt action by Ministry of Defence staff has saved a Napoleonic fortification threatened after winter storms damaged nearby sea defences. Kent coastal redoubt protected once again  Defence Infrastructure Organisation Environment Agency Over the Christmas and New Year break, Defence Infrastructure Organisation ( DIO ) staff from the Cinque Ports Training Area ( CPTA ) in Kent battled the high tides and gale-force winds that threatened the sea defences at both Lydd and Hythe ranges. DIO surveyors alerted the Environment Agency to flooding danger posed by a breach in sea defences at Hythe. This allowed the agency to repair the damage and head off the flood threat to local residents and the Grand Redoubt at Dymchurch. Tom Dauben from the Environment Agency said: Working around the clock with DIO and our contractors enabled us to stabilise the breach and repair the damage. The quick response of all parties ensured that the breach did not deteriorate further and cause flooding to properties or infrastructure. The work has now been completed, leaving the Grand Redoubt safe once more. A scheduled monument , the fortification was built during the Napoleonic War as part of a large defensive scheme to protect the country from an expected French invasion. The structure remains the property of the Ministry of Defence ( MOD ) and is used as a training facility. Richard Goslett, DIO ’s rural estate surveyor at CPTA , said: When the storms began at Christmas we monitored the situation closely and alerted the Environment Agency, who carried out emergency repair works on the sea defences at the redoubt. The completion of the repairs has taken longer than expected because the horrendous weather conditions meant that the contractors were only able to work at low tide. They also had to use quick-drying concrete to fill in the holes in the sea defences before the next high tide. At Hythe Ranges, the heavy seas were so severe that they badly eroded the sea defences in front of the Grand Redoubt. A small hole in the protective sea wall before Christmas quickly grew to the size of a volleyball court by the New Year, threatening to flood the ranges and low-lying parts of Dymchurch and Hythe. Mackley Construction , on behalf of the Environment Agency, began work to repair the sea defences in the middle of January. The work was expected to last 2 weeks, but the continuing bad weather and high tides meant that the work was delayed. Work on the scheme was completed on 14 February 2014. Talking about the project, Lieutenant Colonel Dickie Bishop, Commander DIO Sustainable Development Training South East, said: Completing this work has enabled the DIO to protect a historic coastal monument and ensure that local residents and their properties, along with our military ranges and training facilities, are protected from flooding in the future."

/government/news/orwell-oil-polluter-to-pay-36689,"  Oil from a waste treatment plant in Ipswich polluted four miles of the River Orwell and contaminated 12 swans, one of which died. Orwell oil polluter to pay £36,689  Environment Agency Ipswich Magistrates’ Court heard today (Tues 1) that the company responsible had failed to manage and operate its waste oil treatment site under the terms of its permit. Eco Oil Ltd was fined a total of £30,000 and ordered to pay full costs of £6,569 as well as a victim surcharge of £120. The pollution in July 2012 cost the company’s insurers £169,000 to clean up. Mrs Miriam Tordoff, prosecuting for the Environment Agency, said the company had failed to follow its own procedures and on or about 8 July allowed oil to escape from its interceptor tank, run across the concrete yard and into a surface water drain outside the site entrance. The drain emptied into the river. “Eco Oil failed to notify us of the incident on the day it happened and failed to follow its own management system,” she told magistrates. Part of the River Orwell about 800m from the site is protected as it has numerous conservation designations for birds and wetland including SPA (Special Protection Area), RAMSAR (protected conservation site) and SSSI (Site of Special Scientific Interest) The pollution was discovered during a routine patrol of the river by the Felixstowe Volunteer Coast Patrol Rescue Service. The Harbour Master, Environment Agency and other agencies were then notified. Mrs Tordoff explained to the court that the interceptor tank was used to separate oil from other contaminants including water. This is done using an interceptor or separator, which is a large tank usually situated underground. Over time the oil floats to the top and the water and other contaminants sink allowing the oil to be skimmed off. The Site’s drainage system also runs into the interceptor. Company employees told Agency officers that the interceptor tank had been overwhelmed by the heavy rain. The liquid waste being stored including oil had mix with the rain and overtopped out of manhole covers above the interceptor tank. No contingency plans had been made for heavy rainfall around the date of the pollution even though the company’s own operating procedures stated they should be. After the hearing Environment Agency officer Adrian Sherman said: “The company failed to check the weather and the site was unmanned at a time when heavy rainfall was predicted. “The effect on the river was serious but could have been avoided altogether. The port authority acted quickly and because of this the oil was contained to prevent it from affecting downstream protected habitats.” Magistrates heard that Eco Oil, which has a previous caution for an environmental offence, had since reviewed its procedures and upgraded its equipment. Chairman of the bench Mr Fletcher said: “In considering the sentence we accept the incident occurred during unusual heavy rain but the company acted swiftly and effectively to clean up and paid for remedial work without cost to the public purse. “They have also improved their practices and procedures at considerable cost, however, significant environmental damage was caused to areas close to the SSSI as well as damage to wildlife. “The incident occurred due to failure of established procedures.” Eco Oil pleaded guilty to: On or about 08 July 2012, at Eco Oil Ltd, Ipswich Terminal, Waste Oil Treatment Facility, Cliff Quay, Ipswich, Suffolk, IP3 0BE, you did cause poisonous, noxious or polluting matter to enter inland freshwaters, namely the River Orwell, without being authorised by an environmental permit. Contrary to Regulation 38(1)(a) and Regulation 12(1)(b) of the Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2010. Fined £15,000 On or about 08 July 2012, at Eco Oil Ltd, Ipswich Terminal, Waste Oil Treatment Facility, Cliff Quay, Ipswich, Suffolk, IP3 0BE, you being the holder of Environmental Permit number EP3095EK, failed to comply with condition 1.1.1 (a) of the said Permit in that you failed to manage and operate the activities: In accordance with a written management system that identifies and minimises risks of pollution. Contrary to Regulation 38(2) of the Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2010. Fined £15,000"

Following feedback from local boaters, the Environment Agency is using contractors to clear sediment from the stretch of river. The work at Hemingford Lock follows similar work at Castle Mills Lock near Bedford where in excess of 800 tonnes of gravel has been redistributed. The Environment Agency’s Paul Separovic said: Sediment has been a real problem for boaters and became worse as a result of the recent flooding, building-up and then blocking the navigation channel in places. The work at Castle Mills Lock has been completed and the work crew is currently at another hotspot at Hemingford Lock. The cost of the work will be around £25k across both locations, depending on the final amount of material shifted. We actively maintain our rivers and it’s important to us to address our boating customers’ concerns. The work is ongoing and the situation will be monitored in case further action needs to be taken again in the future. However the good news for now is the navigation is clear and open for use by all boaters – particularly welcome ahead of the Bedford River Festival in July which attracts many visitors."

/government/news/illegal-waste-activity-in-knockin-ends-with-69000-penalty,"On 2 May Jarsan Ltd and Thomas Jones were sentenced at Shrewsbury Crown Court for offences relating to illegal waste activities.  Illegal waste activity in Knockin ends with £69,000 penalty  Environment Agency Jarsan Limited and Thomas Edward Jones had previously pleaded guilty on 16 April 2014 for offences relating to the operation of a regulated facility without an Environmental Permit in a rural part of Shropshire. The Court ordered that Thomas Edward Jones (68) rather than the company should pay the fine and costs and he was fined £24,000 and ordered to pay £45,000 in costs accordingly. The charges were brought by the Environment Agency under Regulations 12 (1)(a), 38 (1)(a) and 41 (1) (a) of the Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2010. In court The prosecution related to the deposit of between 21,000 and 31,000 tonnes of waste soil and rubble at Knockin Heath Business Park, Knockin situated in a rural part of Shropshire. Some of this waste originated from the construction of a new superstore in Welshpool, whereby Jarsan Limited trading as Rob Jones Tractor Hire was one of the appointed waste management companies employed to remove the surplus soil and rubble from the site. Thomas Edward Jones was a Director of Greyhound Services Ltd and an officer of Jarsan Limited who own and operate Knockin Heath Business Park on the B4396 between Shrewsbury and Knockin. Jarsan Limited had registered a series of waste management exemptions with the Environment Agency on the 25 May 2010. Waste Management exemptions permit the limited recovery and recycling of a variety of waste types without the establishment or undertaking being required to hold an environmental permit provided the conditions of the relevant exemptions are adhered to. In May 2010, Environment Agency Officers visited the Knockin Heath Business Park in order to investigate waste soil and rubble deposited at the site. Upon inspection of the exemption documents under the name of Jarsan Limited, it appeared that that far more waste soil and rubble had been deposited than that permitted by the waste exemptions. A land survey of the waste stockpiles carried out on the 22 June 2011 by a third party, confirmed that these quantities were far in excess of the quantities permitted on the site. The waste operation should have been regulated by way of a valid Environmental Permit rather than by registered waste exemptions because of the scale of the activity. After a letter and invitation to attend interview went unanswered, Environment Officers visited the Knockin Heath site on the 20 January 2011 and met with Thomas Edward Jones. Jones informed them that he would not be attending a formal interview. Photographs of piles of waste soil and rubble at the site were taken on that day, and again in March 2011 which included a very large mound of waste soil and rubble. After sentencing Speaking after the case, an Environment Agency officer in charge of the investigation said: “We use permit exemptions to enable the reuse and recycling of waste materials, but we ensure that measures are in place to protect the environment. Waste crime is a serious offence with tough penalties as it can damage the environment, blight local communities and undermine those who operate legally. This case demonstrates that we will not hesitate to prosecute when circumstances warrant it.” In mitigation the defence stated that there was no intention to profit by the company or Mr Jones. The waste was only deposited on Knockin Heath after it could no longer be used in the construction of a new superstore and a consultant had been hired by the defendants to advise on their obligations under the Regulations, the defendants had not “buried their heads in the sand”. Charges Jarsan Limited – Company No.05313877 Between 1 May 2010 and 13 February 2013 Jarsan Limited did operate a regulated facility on land at Knockin Heath Business Park, Knockin Heath, Oswestry, Shropshire which did not benefit from an environmental permit contrary to Regulations 12 and 38 (1) (a) of the Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2010.

/government/news/surveying-storm-damage-from-space-uk-satellite-provides-images-of-somerset-floods,"Satellite images taken by the UK’s disaster monitoring satellite, UK-DMC2, are assisting UK agencies in their response to the severe flooding caused by recent storms. Surveying storm damage from space: UK satellite provides images of Somerset floods  Environment Agency UK Space Agency Cabinet Office The images, which show serious flooding on the Somerset Levels, were taken when the UK activated the International Charter ‘Space and Major Disasters’ – an international effort to task Earth Observation (EO) satellites to provide free satellite data during natural emergencies. Uniquely, the UK is a member of the Charter on a public-private basis that makes best use of the available government and commercial expertise. The UK Space Agency holds a seat on the Charter’s Board, providing policy direction and examining ways to improve Charter performance in future, and DMC International Imaging Ltd (DMCii) operates the Disaster Monitoring Constellation - a commercial satellite constellation made available as part of the Charter satellite fleet - and manages the UK operational contributions as a member of the Charter’s Executive Secretariat. Satellite technology can make a great difference in the aftermath of an emergency, providing invaluable and immediate satellite images and data during times of crisis. In the image of the Somerset Levels, acquired on 08 February 2014, we can clearly see where the River Parrett has burst its banks and flooded the surrounding areas. By using the Charter, UK authorities now have access to a vast range of satellite resources, helping them to assess the extent of damage and decide where to target their resources. Adina Gillespie, the UK Charter Executive Secretariat Member, said: “We are providing on-going support to the Environment Agency and Cabinet Office to facilitate access to the Disaster Monitoring Constellation as well as the satellites available to them through the Charter.” Since it was set up in 1999, the Charter has helped in more than 400 disasters for more than 100 countries. It is rare for the UK to activate the Charter on its own behalf but within the last five weeks it has activated it twice. With storms continuing to batter the country, and with thousands of properties flooded as a result of the heavy rains, the Charter can help in a variety of ways. Satellite images and data can be sent out to the local area teams so they can see the extent of the flooding, and the information can also be combined with other geo data, such as infrastructure and community information, to identify areas most at risk. In the last activation, some of the post-event analysis was used in longer term modelling and the information was also given to Cobra (the government’s emergency committee)."

/government/news/two-doncaster-men-jailed-and-200000-seized-in-illegal-waste-case,"On 14 May 2014, Phillip Slingsby of Hadds Lane, Thorne, Doncaster and Robert Spencer of Oak Farm, Finningley, Doncaster were sentenced at Hull Crown Court. Two Doncaster men jailed and £200,000 seized in illegal waste case  Environment Agency The Insolvency Service The offences relate to illegal waste activities that occurred between 2008 and 2010 at Middleton Quarry, Pollington and then at Wroot Road, Doncaster. Phillip Slingsby, aged 42, was sentenced to a term of 12 months imprisonment, ordered to pay a contribution towards prosecution costs of £20,000 and disqualified as a director for 6 years. He was also subject to a confiscation order in the amount of £200,000 under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 made at an earlier court hearing. No separate penalties were imposed on Mr Slingsby’s associated companies Slingsby Plant Hire Limited and Slingsby Quarries Limited in view of their financial status and the fact that one of the companies has been dissolved whilst the other company is in liquidation. Robert Spencer, aged 63, was sentenced to a term of 9 months imprisonment, suspended for 2 years and ordered to pay £20,000 in confiscation under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. Charges were brought by the Environment Agency under the Environmental Protection Act 1990 and the Environmental Permitting (England & Wales) Regulations 2007 and 2010. Throughout the course of this complex case the Environment Agency worked closely with the Insolvency Service and its own in-house Accredited Financial Investigators to secure orders under Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 and the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986. Operations at Middleton Quarry, Pollington Prosecuting for the Environment Agency, Counsel Mr Christopher Stables told the Court that between December 2008 and April 2009, officers from the Environment Agency visited the Middleton Quarry, Pollington and observed tipping taking place on a large scale. The quarry did not benefit from an environmental permit that would authorise such an activity to take place. In fact, a permit would never have been granted given the proximity of the site to 3 Yorkshire boreholes used for the abstraction of drinking water. Following initial discussions with Mr Slingsby about concerns over the activities taking place, a surveillance operation took place. Officers observed waste being tipped and levelled on an industrial scale. The waste comprised of wood, vegetation, plastics, asbestos sheeting and other non-inert waste. Sample testing results revealed the presence of chrysotile asbestos and asbestos fibres. The nature of the waste tipped posed a significant pollution risk to the nearby water sources. In total 127,000.00 tonnes of waste were deposited at Middleton Quarry. Lawful disposal would have cost in excess of £440,000. Operations at Wroot Road, Doncaster Mr Slingsby then moved operations to 36 Acre Field, Wroot Road, Doncaster, a site owned by Mr Robert Spencer. Between January 2009 and October 2009 Robert Spencer allowed Phillip Slingsby to tip thousands of tonnes of waste on his land when there was no environmental permit in force. It is unlikely that a permit would ever have been granted due to the proximity of the site to water sources, the potential risks posed to ground water and the lack of planning permission. In September 2009, officers from the Environment Agency attended Wroot Road and observed tipping taking place. It was clear to officers that this was a large scale operation. Officers told Mr Spencer that tipping on land was illegal and that it should cease immediately. Further warnings were given and followed up in writing. Mr Spencer claimed that Phillip Slingsby was responsible for the deposit of the waste. Further visits to the site revealed evidence that a large hole had been excavated and then backfilled with waste. The waste included brick, rubble, soil, plastics and green waste, metal, wood and tyres. In October 2010 officers from the Environment Agency conducted a raid of the Wroot Road site. A series of ‘trial pits’ were dug at the site from which samples confirmed the presence of asbestos on site. Waste transfer notes and invoices seized suggested that the defendants made considerable financial gains from operating the site without the benefit of an environmental permit and handling the waste incorrectly. In total around 72,000 tonnes of waste was deposited at Wroot Road. Comments made in passing sentence His Honour Judge Jack stated that the defendants had both acted in a way that had “put the public at serious risk.” The offences were further aggravated by the fact that they were deliberate, committed in environmentally sensitive areas and financially motivated. In passing sentence, he accepted that Robert Spencer was less culpable than Phillip Slingsby. In both cases, the custody threshold was passed and, whilst the sentence imposed on Robert Spencer could be suspended, such was the seriousness of the case, it was appropriate for Phillip Slingsby to serve an immediate term of imprisonment. Speaking after the case, an Environment Agency officer in charge of the investigation said: “This was a large scale waste operation where the defendants allowed waste to be brought onto land without being permitted to do so. Illegal waste sites have the potential to cause serious pollution incidents or harm human health, and this prosecution demonstrates that we take waste crime very seriously and will not hesitate to prosecute if necessary, to protect the environment and local communities.”"

Restocking on the River Snail  Environment Agency In early March each year between 100 and 150 mature dace are transported from the River Snail to the Agency’s Calverton Fish Farm near Nottingham. Here they are spawned artificially in tanks before the pin fry are placed in covered ponds to grow on during the summer and autumn. The brood stock fish are then returned to the source water once they have fully recovered from the spawning process. When the dace fry are large enough in mid to late winter they are stocked to rivers all over England. More fry are produced annually than can be managed at the fish farm site – many thousand are returned after 4 to 6 weeks to the river of origin. Paul Wilkanowski from the Environment Agency’s Fisheries and Biodiversity department said: This process helps to maintain and enhance the river’s biodiversity. The Snail continues to be an excellent dace river. If you see any fish trapped in flood water, fish in distress or illegal fishing, call our incident hotline on 0800 80 70 60 (24 hours)."

Slurry pollution costs Beccles farmer almost £12,000  Environment Agency Lowestoft Magistrates’ Court has fined him a total of £6,000 with £5,839 costs and £120 victim surcharge for the pollution incidents. He pleaded guilty to his partnership business FJ Godfrey & Son allowing slurry to overflow from a storage lagoon in April and letting it run off land through an unknown field drain after spreading in May. The slurry turned the water dark brown and made it smell, prompting reports to the Environment Agency whose officers then investigated. Same watercourse Mrs Claire Corfield, prosecuting for the Environment Agency, told magistrates the first pollution happened when dirty water overtopped the slurry storage lagoon, ran across a field and went into the tributary during exceptional winter rainfall. In May slurry ran off a field into the same watercourse after spreading on one of the farmer’s fields. Mrs Corfield said: The lagoon was poorly maintained and the defendant failed to carry out routine checks. There were no clear procedures for preventing an overflow. Since the incidents the company – a partnership between Godfrey, who ran the farm day to day, and his sister – has increased its storage space. After the hearing Environment Agency officer Ben Marshall said: Although it was an exceptionally wet winter, it still remains the responsibility of farmers to prevent polluting nearby watercourses. These incidents caused long-term pollution by highly polluting dirty water and slurry."

The methodology applies to soils and groundwater that are already contaminated, where the original surface source of the contamination has stopped. The methodology consists of up to 4 assessment levels which progressively follow the pathway from the contaminant source through to the receptor. A remedial target is derived at each level, but this is likely to be less stringent at the next level as additional processes such as dilution are taken into account. This approach enables attention to be focussed on those sites where the risks are greatest. User manual version 3.1 is valid for use with worksheet version 3.2."

/government/news/dredging-on-the-somerset-levels-moves-into-final-phase,"The Environment Agency has dredged 4 km (8 km of river bank) of the Parrett and Tone and is now passing halfway in the dredging operation. Dredging on the Somerset Levels moves into final phase  Environment Agency The dredging is being undertaken using a mixture of floating equipment, large excavators mounted on the riverbanks and even amphibious dredgers. This range of equipment is needed to cope with the large tidal range in the river and the soft ground conditions on the banks. A fleet of tractors and trailers, many driven by local farmers, are carrying the silt away for spreading on agricultural land or for floodbank strengthening. A crop has already been harvested from the first fields that the silt was spread on, back in April. So far, the Agency has removed approximately 80,000 tonnes of silt and remain on programme to complete work by the end of October. This is a major civil engineering project and the Environment Agency is monitoring the impact on the natural environment. Graham Quarrier for the Environment Agency said: We have discovered water voles on the River Tone on a section of bank where we are due to start dredging shortly. We have worked closely with Natural England to obtain an appropriate license. We will be trapping and relocating them over the next week, including checking and setting the traps over the weekend. This will ensure that the completion is not delayed and that we don’t harm a protected species during our works. The Environment Agency will be holding a community open morning between 10am and 12.30pm on Saturday 30 August at the dredging compound at Samways Farm on Riverside in Burrowbridge. Graham Quarrier added: We would ask people to come along to find out more about the dredging and the other work we are completing in the local area. As well as completing the dredge, we are repairing local ‘assets’ like river banks, pumping stations, including improvements to Northmoor Pumping Station, sluices, gates and coastal flood defences that were damaged in the floods. These repairs include work mentioned in the 20 year plan for the Somerset levels and moors. Ends"

/government/news/stobart-biomass-fined-14000-over-waste-wood-pollution-risk,"Dust from wood piles affected nearby properties Stobart Biomass fined £14,000 over waste wood pollution risk  Environment Agency A Penrith-based wood biomass company has been fined £14,000 after one of its waste wood stores in Hull caused a risk of pollution. Stobart Biomass Products Ltd, which has its headquarters on the Penrith Industrial Estate in Haweswater Road, Penrith, was handed the fine on Tuesday 3 June by Hull and Holderness Magistrates Court. The firm was in court over its waste transfer operation at Albert Dock in Hull, where it was storing waste woodchip in 2011 and 2012 for the energy from waste industry. The Environment Agency had given Stobart Biomass some guidance to ensure the stored wood would not cause any problems to the local environment or nearby communities. But when investigating officers visited the site they saw that dust from the wood piles was not being prevented from being blown onto nearby areas during high winds in dry conditions. Sarah Middleton, prosecuting for the Environment Agency, told the court that dust problems did arise as some local residents reported brown dust being blown onto their properties, windows and cars. Stobart Biomass had also failed to protect the dock from the waste. Piles of wood were seen located on a concrete surface but some had no containment to prevent water run-off from entering the water. And one pile of woodchip and household waste was situated so close to the dockside that some of the waste was falling into the water, posing a risk to the Humber Estuary. Environment Agency officers requested that this pile be moved away from the dock edge, and as this work was carried out, significant amounts of waste woodchip, dust and debris blew along the dock. Stobart Biomass admitted one charge of keeping controlled waste in a manner likely to cause pollution or harm to human health. In mitigation, the firm said a dust management plan had been drawn up and passed to a stevedore company, but this other firm had failed to manage the risk appropriately. Joanne Holt, Environmental Crime Team Leader at the Environment Agency, said: Waste management operations can potentially cause many problems to the local environment and neighbourhood – that’s why it is vital that companies ensure they meet all of their environmental obligations. In this case, Stobart Biomass were warned about the potential problems that waste wood piles could cause, but they failed to ensure that it was stored in an appropriate manner. As well as the fine, the company was ordered to pay legal costs of £5,512.73 and a victim surcharge of £15."
/government/news/gravel-removal-work-begins-on-the-wansbeck,"Work will begin removing gravel in Morpeth on Monday 4 August. Gravel removal work begins on the Wansbeck  Environment Agency The Environment Agency this month begins the next phase of its gravel management scheme on the River Wansbeck at Morpeth. The removal of gravel from the watercourse will improve river flow and maintain the gravel at a level that is in line with the design of the Morpeth flood scheme. The work will involve the removal of material from a river bank at Stobs Ford, followed by work to reduce the height of the island downstream of the stepping stones at Bakehouse steps. Material will then be removed from a bank between Chantry Foot Bridge and Bennett’s walk. The works will begin on Monday 4 August; the schedule is expected to take around four weeks to complete. Earlier this year the Environment Agency removed a substantial amount of gravel that had built up next to Oliver’s Mill. As well as reducing flood risk, much of the work is designed to create wider wet margins at the water’s edge. These will help to maintain biodiversity along the river through Morpeth. Increasing and enhancing marginal vegetation is a recommend method of improving rivers under the European Water Framework Directive. When the work is done, the area will be surveyed and the levels will be used as part of the Environment Agency’s ongoing gravel management plan in Morpeth. David Clark, flood risk management officer at the Environment Agency, said: This is important work to maintain the levels of gravel that can accumulate in the river over time. By removing material at key points in the watercourse, and monitoring the river over time, we can ensure that the water can flow freely and safely through the town’s defences. Anyone who would like any further information on the gravel management works can find out more by dropping into the Environment Agency’s flood centre on Newgate Street, Morpeth. Check our flood risk web pages to find out if you are at risk of flooding. You can also Register for free Flood Warnings if they are available in your area.

/government/news/a-fishy-taster-session,"Scores of keen anglers from across Shropshire took part in an exciting fish scale sampling event on Sunday 1 June. A fishy taster session  Environment Agency The free event in Bridgnorth, hosted by the Environment Agency, and supported by a range of partners, provided an opportunity for visitors to learn about how to safely collect fish scales. Complimentary scale sampling kits were also handed out. Brecht Morris, an Environment Agency Fisheries & Biodiversity Technical Officer and avid fisherman, led the practical demonstration at Kinver Freeliners’ Woodland & Lodge Park Pools. Mr Morris, said: It was great to see so many people come along and experience the training. This shows that there is an appetite for such sessions and I was pleased to help, thanks to our partners for their support.” The sampling opportunity was part of an ongoing ground-breaking project which involves predator anglers studying pike and zander on the Rivers Severn, Warwickshire Avon and Wye. The research team intend to first collate scale samples, which will help provide a baseline of data establishing average annual growth rates, for future comparison. Later, it is hoped that the project will extend to include data on fish movements. Other partners involved in the project include The Angling Trust, Severn Rivers Trust, Pike Anglers’ Club, Zander Anglers’ Club, Lure Anglers’ Society and the Canal & River Trust. Dilip Sarkar MBE, Fisheries Enforcement Manager, the Angling Trust said: The Severn Basin Predator Study provides an unprecedented opportunity not only for research into predatory fish species, but equally for the Environment Agency, Angling Trust, Lure Anglers’ Society and Severn Rivers Trust to engage with predator anglers. We are delighted to have the support of both the Pike Anglers’ Club and Zander Anglers’ Club in this endeavour, in addition to individual predator specialists. This will hopefully, therefore, herald a whole new era of interaction and understanding for all involved – whilst promoting a better appreciation and furthering our knowledge of the species involved. John Ellis, National Fisheries and Angling Manager at the Canal and River Trust said: Fish are the best indicator when trying to find out the health of an ecosystem on a canal or river and by analysing fish scales we can work out just how quickly the fish are growing. Removing scales is completely harmless and doesn’t cause any distress to the fish. Once caught, the fish will be measured, weighed and then released allowing them to carry on exploring the nation’s waterways."

/government/news/police-and-environment-agency-swoop-on-water,"Police and Environment Agency Fisheries Enforcement carried out a joint raid on one of Cambridgeshire’s coarse fisheries yesterday.   Police and Environment Agency swoop on water  Environment Agency Operation ‘Vulcan’ involved 15 officers from Cambridgeshire police and the Environment Agency carrying out searches on site for alleged offences under the Theft Act, Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries Act and the Import of Live Fish Act. Intelligence Operation Vulcan was the culmination of weeks of investigation, with police officers working side-by-side with Environment Agency staff. The investigation was based on intelligence collected and reported locally by anglers and involved a fishery close to Peterborough. Kye Jerrom, Environment Agency Fisheries Enforcement Officer, said: Specimen carp can have a surprisingly high value, not just for the individual fish, but the associated amenity value to the water they swim in. A carp of 40lb could easily sell for £4,000 and anglers might spend up to £600 per year just to fish for it. Fish theft might not be a well-known crime, but it certainly hits the pockets of those affected. Illegal fish movement can also increase the risk of disease and threatens ecology of waters. We take this crime very seriously and work with anglers to ensure we protect and enhance all fisheries, big or small, natural or newly created, and the legal fish supply trade. Netting PC Alun Bradshaw of Cambridgeshire Police Wildlife Crime team said: The investigation was launched after information came to light that fish may potentially have been illegally sourced from other waters. We are working with the Environment Agency’s skilled staff and specialists to help match any captures to those suspected of being from different waters. The operation involved netting on the site and detailed searches of the fishery and outhouses. Any suspected Illegal fishing activity should be reported to the Environment Agency’s Incident Hotline on 0800 80 70 60. All anglers need a valid Environment Agency rod licence which allows them to use up to two rods. Licenses can be bought using a credit or debit card by calling the Environment Agency’s telesales line on 0344 800 5386. Alternatively, they can be obtained from any Post Office or via the internet."
/government/news/middlesbrough-recycling-firm-fined-14400,"S B Recycling Ltd operated waste site without a permit Middlesbrough recycling firm fined £14,400  Environment Agency A Middlesbrough recycling firm has been fined £14,400 for operating a waste facility without an environmental permit. S B Recycling Ltd, based in Normanby Road, was sentenced at Teesside Magistrates’ Court on 16 September following an Environment Agency investigation into a South Bank site known as the Junction Works. Prosecuting for the Environment Agency, Ros Scott-Bell told the court that illegal activities at the site were reported in 2012. The Junction Works used to be used by a company called Skipfreight, but this had ceased trading and the associated environmental permit was no longer valid for new waste operations. Malcolm Nee, a manager at S B Recycling who held the previous permit, was warned that he could not bring any waste onto the site without a valid permit. But waste was deposited there regardless of the law. In November 2012, an investigating officer visited the site and found evidence that waste had been brought in and tipped in the yard. Despite further warnings, S B Recycling has never made an application for an environmental permit. In court, the company admitted one charge of operating a waste facility without the required permit. Jonathan O’Neill, Environment Officer at the Environment Agency, said: S B Recycling operated a waste facility with a blatant disregard for the environmental permits that are required by law. In the first instance, the Environment Agency attempts to advise companies on how they can operate within the rules - but when significant breaches are seen, we will prosecute. Companies that attempt to dodge environmental laws place the local environment at risk of pollution and they undermine legitimate businesses. Anyone who believes a waste site may be operating illegally is urged to inform the Environment Agency by calling our hotline, on 0800 807060. As well as the fine, the company was ordered to pay costs of £2,008.35 and a victim surcharge of £120. The court also made a wasted costs order of £300 against the firm’s defence solicitor, David Scourfield of David Scourfield Solicitors, Middlesbrough. This was made following three ineffective hearings, earlier in the proceedings, that the court agreed had been the solicitor’s fault."

/government/news/we-want-your-views-on-the-water-environment,"The Environment Agency is asking for views on how to improve and protect the water environment in the South West.  We want your views on the water environment  Environment Agency Take a moment to think about how much you use or are near water in your everyday life. Did you know that the Environment Agency has set out plans for how water in the South West will be looked after in coming years? And now is the time for you to have your say on how we will do this. Water quality in the South West has steadily improved over the last 20 years. The draft river basin management plan (dRBMP) for the South West looks at water in each catchment across the river basin across the South West peninsula and suggests how we can work with others to ensure that 100% of our waters are in good condition by 2027. Jeremy Bailey, Programme Manager for the Environment Agency, said: The Water Framework Directive gives us an important opportunity to make real improvements to the water environment. We value the views of others and know that river basin planning can only succeed if we work with local partners and take local action. We urge anyone with an interest in the water environment to take a look at the information about their local area in the consultation and let us know what they think.’ It is vital that people and organisations get involved in the consultation. This is your opportunity to influence the final plan and ensure that its contents are practical, achievable and effective for you and your interests. The consultation runs from 10 October 2014 to 10 April 2015 and can be found at www.gov.uk/government/consultations/update-to-the-draft-river-basin-management-plans where comments can be made online to the consultation. Ends Notes to Editors: • The Water Framework Directive (WFD) takes a strategic and integrated approach to managing the land and water environment in river basins. It involves working with key partners to set environmental objectives for all groundwater, surface waters, estuaries and coastal waters within the European Community on a river basin scale. The WFD requires us to draw up plans for meeting these objectives in each river basin district. The SWRBD has been further broken down into 12 catchments. The WFD is an opportunity for people and organisations to work together to protect and improve the quality of every aspect of the water environment from groundwaters, rivers and lakes to estuaries and coasts. • The final plan will set out how the water environment will be managed over the next 5 years. The plan states the current state of each water body within the river basin district, what we hope to achieve for it and summarises what actions we will use to deliver the plans."

/government/news/drivers-warned-not-to-risk-driving-through-floodwater,"The Environment Agency and the AA warn that more than 60% of drivers are still taking unnecessary risks by driving through floodwater.  Drivers warned not to risk driving through floodwater  Environment Agency Environment Agency and AA are urging drivers to be flood aware as new survey findings reveal that more than two thirds of men and half of women would still risk driving through flood water - despite last year being the wettest on record. The ford on Rufford Lane in Newark, Nottinghamshire has been named the number 1 flood-accident hotspot in the UK, with 96 flood-related rescues in 5 years. Other locations with multiple rescues include Water Gate Lane in Leicester and the ford in Bucklebury in Berkshire. All of the AA’s top 20 flood rescue spots are in England, with 12 of them located at fords. A joint survey by the Environment Agency and the AA reveals that despite last year being the wettest winter on record more than 60% of UK drivers – 20 million in total – would still risk an accident by driving through flood water. There have been 21,687 AA flood rescues since 2009. Serious accidents occur each year by drivers taking unnecessary risks and going ahead with a journey despite Environment Agency flood warnings. The largest number of rescues from flood water on a single day in the last five years was Christmas Eve 2013 – with 642 rescues. The Environment Agency issued more than 450 flood warnings and alerts on the same day and drivers are being encouraged to check flood risk information for their entire route before setting out. The survey of more than 19,000 AA members, carried out by Populus, also found that: Twice as many men (equating to 1.36million drivers) than women (680,000 drivers) would risk driving through flood water that’s up to knee height – just 30cm can move a car. 2 in 5 (44%) drivers would choose another route in the event of flood warnings. Those in the East Midlands would be most likely to do this (48%), and those in London the least likely to (39%). Only just over a third (36%) of drivers would turn around and go another way if the road ahead was completely covered by standing flood water. Men are more likely to take risks than women – 66% of male drivers compared with 54% of female drivers would risk driving through flood water. John Curtin, director of incident management and resilience at the Environment Agency, said: Too many drivers end up putting themselves in danger – and potentially those who come to their rescue – by taking unnecessary risks during flooding. It can be hard to tell what hazards lie beneath flood water, but more often than not there’s a lot of misery and a much longer delay than a well planned detour. We need drivers to check the flood risk for their entire route before they travel. Our flood warning information on GOV.UK is updated every 15 minutes and can help anyone plan a safe journey. Darron Burness, head of the AA’s flood rescue team, said: During last winter, which was the wettest on record, we alone attended around 4,400 flood-related call-outs but many were completely avoidable. Some people don’t fully appreciate the dangers posed by flood water. Fords catch a lot of people out. Just because it’s a designated crossing point, don’t assume that it’s always safe to cross – the depth of the water and its flow rate can quickly change with the weather. Just one foot or 30 centimetres of moving water can float your car, so if you’re at all unsure of the conditions, turn round rather than risk your vehicle being swept down river.

/government/news/new-arc-boat-to-help-shropshire-prepare-for-flooding,"ARC-Boat number 50 will be the newest Environment Agency recruit helping to issue quicker and more accurate flood warning information. New ARC-Boat to help Shropshire prepare for flooding  Environment Agency Environment Agency Water Resources teams were involved at the development stage of the boats and following initial operational success, staff quickly identified its ability to assist in the flood monitoring process. In Shropshire, this boat will be used to measure flows at the Severn/Vyrnwy confluence to improve flood warning models. During times of high river levels, the boat may be seen at sites along the River Severn including Montford, Shrewsbury, Ironbridge and Bridgnorth. The boat will be used to survey the river bed of the Severn, Teme and Tern, which will send important information to the Environment Agency teams. The benefits explained Rob Davies from the Environment Agency said: “These boats will enable us to measure a full range of flows at sites like Onibury on the River Onny near Ludlow. These measurements are really important as it gives us the data we need to give more accurate and quicker flood warnings to local communities.” The boats are manufactured by HR Wallingford in Oxfordshire and have been supplied to clients around the world including Canada, New Zealand, France, Azerbaijan. The Environment Agency already has around 30 of these boats in operation, but this one is special as it is the 50th boat to be produced. Rob explained that the Environment Agency first used an ARC-Boat on the River Thames in 2011. “The boats are remote controlled and measure the speed and depth of the water to enable it to calculate river flow. They allow us to easily and safely reach places where humans can’t, such as under bridges or during high-flows/floods. Ultra-sound pulses, similar to that used to scan pregnant women, are used to collect important data from the river. This data helps us to monitor flows in the river which in turn helps our flood and water teams assess what action is required, for example, to determine where defences may be required.” The 50th ARC-Boat Keith Powell from HR Wallingford said: “Delivery of ARC-Boat number 50 is an important milestone for us. Handing it over to one of the Environment Agency’s teams is particularly satisfying, as their staff played an important role in its development. With the ARC-Boats they are mapping more of our rivers and in greater detail than was previously possible, and the data they are collecting will improve the accuracy of flood warnings. We are pleased to be able to support their work.” The boats are just one of the tools that Environment Agency teams use in the flood warning and informing process.

/government/news/norfolk-company-fined-almost-1-per-illegal-tonne,"Contaminated waste was taken illegally to a farm for spreading on the land and yesterday the supplier Glazewing Ltd was fined £3,600. Norfolk company fined almost £1 per illegal tonne  Environment Agency Norwich Crown Court also ordered the company to pay full Environment Agency costs of £4,718. Mrs Anne-Lise McDonald, prosecuting for the Agency, said offences came to light when a member of the public complained that soil contaminated with plastics, insulation foam, metals, cables and household waste had been deposited on fields off West Dereham Road near Wretton in August 2013. 3,910 tonnes of soil had been taken by Glover Farming (West Dereham) Ltd and should have been of a quality to improve the land but instead it was ‘significantly contaminated’. Officers investigated and found the waste had been spread on 5 fields. 4 have since been cleared and the waste sent to landfill. Waste from the 5th was taken back sometime later. Reckless The court heard that Glazewing processes and sells scrap metal and has a small waste management division. Waste is put through a machine to separate out soil but if it is not clean enough it is sent to landfill. Glazewing Ltd operate a waste transfer station on Station Road in West Dereham under an environmental permit. Mrs McDonald said the company had been reckless: It failed to put in place and enforce systems to avoid an offence. As a company working in the field of waste management it was fully aware of its duty of care. Basic visual checks of the waste ought to have resulted in it being stopped from being sent out at all. Because the soil was not clean, the farm it was sent to was not permitted to take that type of waste. Glazewing was guilty of failing to prevent the farm company committing an offence by taking the waste, failing to check they were authorize to carry it, and failing to describe the waste properly on waste transfer notes. Mr Jonathan Miles, director of Glazewing, told investigating officers that the company accepted it had failed its duty of care. It had paid the farming company £3 per tonne to take the waste but admitted it would have cost it much more to dispose of it at a landfill site. ‘Negligent’ Defending Glazewing, Miss Sam Riggs told the court that the company could have taken the waste to its own landfill site free of charge and the transport costs would have been £3.12 per tonne. Sentencing, Judge Stephen Holt said the company had been negligent but had considerable mitigation. After the hearing Environment Agency officer Euan Simpson said: The mis-description of waste is a high priority issue for the Environment Agency at the moment and this case highlights how important it is for waste operators to comply with the Duty of Care Regulations. Waste management companies like Glazewing must ensure that they have all the necessary Duty of Care checks in place to avoid this sort of environmental incident occurring in the first place."
/government/news/waste-operator-to-pay-19000,"Barry Patchett, a waste operator from Louth, has been fined £1,000 and ordered to pay more than £18,000 costs for running an illegal site.  Waste operator to pay £19,000  Environment Agency Patchett, aged 53, failed to apply for the right permits despite advice and guidance from the Environment Agency in 2010 and 2013. Forced entry to site Mr Richard Banwell, prosecuting for the Environment Agency, told Lincoln magistrates court yesterday (Wednesday 3 December) that no application had ever been received and several failed attempts were made by officers to carry out a full site inspection. In the end a forced entry was made in September 2013 with the assistance of Lincolnshire Police. Officers found more than 9,000 tonnes of waste on the land at Tetney Lock Road, New Delights, Tetney, Grimsby, including demolition materials and green waste. Patchett, of Firebeacon Lane, Wragholme, and his company, BJ Patchett & Sons Ltd, were asked to attend an interview but they declined. The company had gone into liquidation. Early this year (February 2014) it appeared that more waste had been deposited at the entrance and a rubble pile had grown. Mr Banwell said: The offence was committed over several months and it was financially motivated because the waste operation was part of his business. Mr Patchett also failed to respond to advice or to clear the site as requested. Patchett had pleaded not guilty at an earlier hearing but changed his plea to guilty yesterday, the first day of a 3 day trial. Mitigating for Patchett, Mr John Wyn Williams said that Patchett had been confused by environmental regulations which are complex and Patchett thought his waste facility was compliant. This was also his first environmental offence. In sentencing, District Judge Stobart said it was not a case deserving the severest penalty. Patchett may have given too little time and thought to the requirements but he knew he had to make changes in order to keep his waste site running. Following the sentencing guideline for environmental offences, and taking into account Mr Patchett’s means, District Judge Stobart fined him £1,000 and ordered him to pay full prosecution costs of £18,334. After the hearing Environment Agency officer Toni Storr said: “Waste crime is a serious offence. It can damage the environment, blight local communities and undermine those who operate legally.” Patchett pleaded guilty to the following charge: Between 2 October 2012 and 14 February 2014 on land at Tetney Lock Road, New Delights, Tetney, Grimsby, Lincs you did operate a regulated facility, namely a waste operation for the deposit and storage of waste, without being authorised by an environmental permit granted under Regulation 13 of the Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2010.

/government/news/7500-fish-in-christmas-stocking-helps-revive-west-london-river,"The River Crane in Middlesex has been restocked with thousands of fish as it continues its recovery from 2 serious pollution incidents. 7500 fish in Christmas stocking helps revive West London river  Environment Agency The Environment Agency, working as part of the Crane Valley Partnership to restore the river’s vitality following major sewage spills in 2011 and 2013, released 2000 chub, 2000 dace, 2000 roach and 1500 barbel into the river on Wednesday 3 December. They were introduced downstream of Staines Road, North Feltham and were supplied from the Environment Agency’s own Calverton Fish Farm where they were bred. Volunteers from the London Wildlife Trust, Hounslow Council and the Thames Angling Conservancy helped with the restocking. It is the first in a new 4-year fish stocking programme, funded by Thames Water, to help return the Crane back to a thriving waterway teeming with a diversity of fish and other wildlife. Environment Agency Fisheries Technical Officer Neil Winter oversaw the operation. He said: “Two major pollution events in 2 years had a devastating impact on large sections of the river’s ecosystem, including its fish population. “Thanks to the combined effort of many organisations and individuals however, the river has already recovered to the point where water quality and food sources, such as invertebrates, can sustain fish once more. “Some fish have already migrated into the previously depopulated areas from other parts of the river, but this is a slow process. “We want to gently accelerate the increase in fish numbers, so are giving nature a helping hand by adding species commonly found in the Crane and surrounding rivers. We are doing this in a carefully phased way, so that we do not destabilise the river’s recovering, but still fragile, ecosystem. Not only does the fish stocking boost the river’s biodiversity, it will also return the river to a valuable recreational angling resource for the local community” The new 4-year restocking programme replaces one put in place after the first pollution incident in 2011. That was caused by an illegal discharge of untreated sewage for which Thames Water was prosecuted and fined, but also made a voluntary £400,000 donation to the restoration effort. A first successful restocking took place in December 2012, but the benefits of this were wiped out when treated sewage sludge flowed into the river as a result of criminal damage to a pipe carrying the sludge between Thames Water’s sewage treatment plants in Iver and Mogden. Despite extensive efforts the culprits for this damage could not be identified. Work to restore the Crane has been ongoing since that setback, led by the Crane Valley Partnership with the funding from Thames Water. Richard Aylard, External Affairs and Sustainability Director at Thames Water, said: “No amount of money can make up for the damage caused to a river by a pollution incident, but our financial contribution is funding important work that will help restore and improve the river over time. “We’re really pleased that some excellent projects have been put forward to the Crane Valley Partnership by local organisations and we look forward to seeing the results.” The Environment Agency has also developed a range of water quality improvement actions for the River Crane as part of the River Basin Management Plan for the River Thames Basin District. These actions are outlined in the London catchment summary.

/government/news/prison-and-a-tag-for-wellingborough-recycler,"A timber recycling company director was yesterday (Tues 13 Jan) given a 6-month prison sentence and a curfew order for a month.  Prison and a tag for Wellingborough recycler  Environment Agency David Lewis McEwan was also ordered by Northampton Crown Court to pay £1,800 towards costs for the Environment Agency which prosecuted the director for two offences. His prison sentence was suspended for 18 months and he will have to wear an electronic tag for a month. The director was at the helm of Larner Timber Recycling in Bevan Close, Wellingborough, Northamptonshire which went into administration in September 2013. Mrs Anne-Lise McDonald prosecuting told the court that from May 2012 the company chipped and sorted waste wood. It breached a condition to have a written management system to protect people and the environment. When after nearly a year it did produce a management system it failed to follow the system leading to a greater risk of fire. She said the site had accumulated a huge volume of waste wood which was stored without any fire breaks. Wood particles from chipping escaped from the site polluting neighbours’ sites and causing a further breach of its permit. McEwan was also the director of an adjoining business Larner Pallet Recycling which was prosecuted in May 2012 for causing dust pollution. Mrs McDonald told the court that McEwan was repeatedly asked for adequate management and emissions plans but none were forthcoming until April 2013. She said: A notice was served two months later to prevent the acceptance, shredding, pulverising and chipping of wood to prevent the serious risk of pollution from fire. In December 2012 there was a fire at Larner Timber Recycling which started in an old shipping container used to store woodchip. The fire service had difficulty getting to the fire because of the amount of wood on site. In May and June 2013 piles of chipped wood were seen smouldering and despite advice from Environment Agency officers to create fire breaks, insufficient were created. After the hearing Environment Agency officer John Jones said: This prosecution was entirely avoidable had the company complied with our advice. We repeatedly tried to help it comply with its permit but despite many visits and much advice, little was changed. Waste sites have a duty to ensure that their operations are managed properly to ensure they do not present a risk to neighbouring companies, nor to the environment. If they refuse to comply, or deliberately ignore advice supplied by site Inspectors, they may be prosecuted and risk going to jail. In mitigation Mr Steven Evans said McEwan tried to keep his business going but did not have the money after being mis-sold financial products. He said McEwan had done some things such as buying water cannons to keep the dust down . The court was told that McEwan had a history of non-compliance. Judge Timothy Smith said McEwan had ‘put his head in the sand’. There were a number of issues with the site with waste being stored for more than three months, water cannons not used effectively and fire breaks not properly installed. The temperature of the waste was not properly monitored to locate hot spots. McEwan pleaded guilty on 15 December 2014 to: Between 7 May 2012 and 10 September 2013 at Bevan Close, Finedon Industrial Estate, Wellingborough NN8 4BL, Larner Timber Recycling Ltd, with your consent connivance or attributable to neglect on your part as a director of Larner Timber Recycling Ltd, failed to comply with condition 1.1.1(a) of an Environmental Permit reference EPR/FB3838RH, in that it failed to ensure the activities were managed and operated in accordance with a written management system that identified and minimised risks of pollution, including those arising from operations, maintenance, accidents and incidents. Contrary to Regulation 38(2) and 41(1)(a) and (b) Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2010 Between 23 May 2012 and 3 July 2013 at Bevan Close, Finedon Industrial Estate, Wellingborough NN8 4BL, Larner Timber Recycling Ltd, with your consent connivance or attributable to neglect on your part as a director of Larner Timber Recycling Ltd, failed to comply with condition 3.1.1 of an Environmental Permit reference EPR/FB3838RH, in that emissions of substances, not controlled by emission limits, caused pollution, and it failed to take appropriate measures to prevent or where that is not practicable, to minimise, those emissions. Contrary to Regulation 38(2) and 41(1)(a) and (b) Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2010"
/government/news/sita-fined-over-110000-for-breaching-permit-at-surrey-landfill,"SITA, a recycling and resource management company are fined over £110,000 for breaching permit at Surrey landfill site SITA fined over £110,000 for breaching permit at Surrey landfill  Environment Agency SITA UK Ltd – a recycling and resource management company - has been fined a total of £110,000 by Redhill Magistrates Court on 13 January 2015 for breaching the conditions of its environmental permit and for failing to comply with an Enforcement Notice for its landfill site at Albury Landfill, Albury, Nr Guildford, Surrey. SITA UK Ltd was fined £110,000 and ordered to pay £8,832 in legal costs. SITA UK Ltd had exceeded the landfill site’s leachate limit set out in its environmental permit which is granted by the Environment Agency. During 2013 there were 8 leachate wells that were non-compliant with the permit requirement of a maximum leachate level of 3 metres above the base. Redhill Magistrates Court heard how the type of waste deposited at the Landfill will degrade and produce both gas and leachate. In order to reduce the risk of leachate escaping the site and polluting the groundwater, the Landfill is lined with an engineered system on the base consisting of clay overlain by a plastic liner. The clay extends across the base of each cell and up the side slope to a level of three metres above the base, with only the plastic liner rising higher. The court heard how SITA UK Ltd had continued non-compliance of its leachate levels despite ongoing guidance and support from Environment Agency officers. In 2013, Pollution Prevention and Control Officers made a number of visits to Albury Landfill to undertake monitoring, which confirmed that the leachate levels remained high. Pollution Prevention and Control Officer Neil Martin said: We always seek to work with companies to help them operate within the law and we could not have done more than in this case. Although prosecution is the last resort, SITA UK Ltd left us with no choice but to take the matter to the courts. This shows how seriously we take these matters and demonstrates that we will not allow the environment to be put at risk as a consequence of not complying with our environmental permits. In February 2014, SITA UK Ltd came into compliance with their leachate levels by supplementing treatment through the on-site leachate treatment plant with tankering leachate off site for treatment elsewhere. The company is now continuing to focus on completing the capping and restoration of the landfill, which will help reduce the generation of leachate at the site. Ends Notes to editors: The Landfill comprises of a series of cells for the disposal of non-hazardous waste and is situated in a former sand quarry near Guildford, Surrey. The Landfill has progressively been filled with household, commercial and industrial waste since 1992. The Landfill is located in the Lower Greensand of the Folkestone and Hythe Beds which are aquifers. The Landfill has now ceased acceptance of waste for disposal and is undergoing final capping and restoration. Environment Agency Guidance on monitoring of landfill sites states that landfill leachate is a potentially polluting liquid, which unless managed or treated, may cause harmful effects on the groundwater and surface water that surround a landfill site. In order to protect the environment, landfill sites have specific limits set on the level that leachate can reach.

/government/news/project-starts-to-reconnect-woodgate-valley-country-park,"The Environment Agency starts work to improve the ecology of the Bourn Brook which flows through Woodgate Valley Country Park, Birmingham.  Project starts to reconnect Woodgate Valley Country Park  Environment Agency Working with Birmingham City Council, the Environment Agency has secured funding to modify a number of concrete weir structures. This should help create a better place where wildlife can thrive and local people can reconnect with their environment. The work starts this week and includes creating a new channel around one of the weir structures and removing the large stones from another 4 concrete weirs which are currently acting as barriers to fish and invertebrates moving up and downstream. The weirs also disrupt sediment movement. Changing the weirs should help increase the range of aquatic life that are found in the Bourn Brook and make the brook more resilient if a pollution event occurs. The Environment Agency hopes these improvements will provide a better quality environment for local people to visit and enjoy. Throughout the main part of Woodgate Valley Country Park there are 10 weirs. Three are brick step structures with a ford and footbridge close by and the rest are concrete structures. The concrete weirs have pillars used as stepping stones by park users although this is not thought to be their original purpose. The Environment Agency hopes the work will encourage the public to cross the brook using the footbridges instead, which is much safer. The work will take approximately 10 days to complete. There may be minor disruption to park users while the work is being carried out. The Environment Agency will be carrying out ongoing monitoring with the help of the Freshwater Invertebrate Network community volunteers to see how the ecology of the Bourn Brook is responding. Alex McDonald, Environment Agency Project Manager said: The improvements are the first step in restoring the watercourse. We should start to see real benefits for fish, invertebrates and the local community. This will help the Bourn Book reach its full potential."
/government/news/company-hands-over-almost-250000-proceeds-of-crime,"  Rory J Holbrook Limited was yesterday (27 Jan) ordered to pay £247,278 proceeds of crime by Norwich Crown Court for illegally tipping waste on land in Blofield, Norfolk. Company hands over almost £250,000 proceeds of crime  Environment Agency The company, which was also fined £30,000 and ordered to pay a contribution to the prosecution costs of £20,000, admitted taking waste to the Yarmouth Road site. It said excess waste was treated and sold off site. The remainder formed the basis of a golf course. Mr Mark Watson, representing the Environment Agency, said in essence the company was running a waste transfer station. An exemption had been registered for the site but it only allowed the use of suitable waste for small scale construction to avoid the use of virgin raw materials. The limit under the exemption was 5,000 tonnes of aggregates – company records showed that 94,000 tonnes had been taken to the site, he said. Mr Watson said: The exemption does not allow the treatment of waste and does not allow for the use of any contaminated soil. He told the court that when Environment Agency officers first visited the site they saw piles of various wastes which included soil, rubble, asphalt, and aggregate fines. There was evidence the company had taken waste from a groundworks company, a contractor for 2 developers who were building at nearby sites, 1 of which required remediation due to historic soil contamination. He also said some of the waste that had been treated at the Blofield site had been sold. Mr Watson said: The company turnover from the site was in excess of £500,000 and it also gained financially by not paying for permit applications and subsistence fees. Mr Andrew McGee, representing the company, said that it was not a deliberate breach of the law but a negligent breach. He said the company kept consistent records and co-operated with the investigation. Judge Katherine Moore found the culpability of the company to be significantly reckless. She made a confiscation order to include the avoided tipping fees, avoided permit fees and money made from selling aggregates from the treatment of waste. After the hearing investigating Environment Agency officer Louise Howard said: Abuse of low risk exemptions to operate waste sites which require full environmental permits is not something the Environment Agency tolerates. Illegal waste sites of this sort impact on the legitimate waste trade by undercutting and have the potential to adversely impact the environment. Along with investigating and taking enforcement action against these crimes, we are also making greater use of the Proceeds of Crime Act to further deter repeat offending. The company pleaded guilty at an earlier court hearing to: Between 15 March 2011 and 26 November 2012 at land off Yarmouth Road, Blofield, Norfolk, NR13 4JS you did operate a regulated facility, namely a waste operation for the deposit and disposal of waste, without being authorised by an environmental permit granted under Regulation 13 of the of the Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2010. Contrary to Regulation 12(1)(a) and 38(1)(a) Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2010. Fined £18,000. Between 15 March 2011 and 26 November 2012 on land off Yarmouth Road, Blofield, Norfolk, NR13 4JS you did treat controlled waste when there was not in force an environmental permit granted by the enforcing authority pursuant to sections 35 and 36 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 authorising the said treatment. Contrary to section 33(1)(b) and 33(6) Environmental Protection Act 1990 Fined £12,000"
/government/news/kent-boaters-fined-for-sailing-around-the-registration,"Two boaters in Kent have been ordered to pay out after illegally using their boats on the River Medway in Kent Kent boaters fined for sailing around the registration  Environment Agency Two men have been ordered to pay a combined amount of over £1150 for illegally using their vessels on the River Medway without valid registrations. Lyndsay Beadle, of Barnsole Road, Gillingham, pleaded guilty and was fined £135 with costs of £115, a compensation order of £340 and victim surcharge of £20 at Maidstone Magistrates’ Court on 5 February after failing to apply for a boat registration. His vessel “Fortuna” was seen on 24 June 2014 at The Riverside Moorings, upstream of Allington Lock without a valid registration certificate displayed. Mr Beadle was made aware he needed to comply with the Environment Agency’s boat registration requirements, however he failed to do so. Also at Maidstone Magistrates’ Court on 5 February, Mr Gordon Marshall, of College Avenue, Maidstone, pleaded guilty and was fined £115 with costs of £115, a compensation order of £291 and victim surcharge of £20 as his vessel “Carleys Pride” was used without a valid licence. The vessel was seen on the Medway Navigation at the rear of College Avenue without a valid registrations displayed. Environment Agency records show that Mr Marshall had submitted the registration application, but had failed to provide payment or a compliant boat safety certificate. A notification was sent to Mr Marshall in July 2014; despite this no registration or fees were received. In his mitigation Mr Marshall apologised to the Court and said that the oversight was his responsibility. Rebecca Cox, Environment Agency Waterways Officer said: The revenue we receive from vessel licensing is essential. Without it, we are unable to complete our annual maintenance programme such as lock repairs and dredging, and providing facilities like moorings, toilets and showers. We are lucky to have such a popular and well known public right of navigation in Kent that is enjoyed by so many. By not complying, the revenue is lost, threatening the future of this great waterway. The Environment Agency carry out regular patrols on the River Medway, so owners of boats not displaying valid registration plates could face prosecution. It is important that they are aware of and adhere to this requirement. Ignorance is not an excuse."
/government/news/derby-pollution-threat-resolved,"A serious pollution incident on Chaddesden Brook has now been scaled back after the initial threat was contained. Derby pollution threat resolved  Environment Agency Slurry entered the brook from a local field and the change in water colour alerted a local resident who was walking his dog nearby, who then called the Environment Agency incident hotline to report his concerns. Our officers attended the scene and found the source before taking action to contain, identify and deal with the pollutant. Mark Cunningham, team leader at the Environment Agency said: The vigilance and actions of the resident ensured that a huge amount of slurry did not enter the brook and flow into the River Derwent. As the amount of pollutant was restricted, less intervention was needed. We will be carrying out further tests on the brook and the Derwent but there has been no significant environmental impact identified so far.” Tests have already shown that high concentrations of ammonia were present in the water that would be expected to be toxic to fish. By reducing the spill and ensuring that the vast majority of the slurry was stopped from entering the water we avoided major fish casualties on the Derwent and meant the warning we gave to Severn Trent Water over the drinking water extraction points on the river was purely precautionary. The landowner once notified of the problem worked hard through the night to reduce the threat by digging trenches to contain the slurry, and then remove it from the site. Mark continued: At this point we have made no decision on further action, we are awaiting the results of a biological survey and need to establish the exact circumstances that led to this.” We encourage members of the public who see any impact of the pollution or any dead fish to report the matter to our incident hotline on 0800 807060."

/government/news/sheffield-company-must-pay-38000-for-illegally-spreading-waste,"A Sheffield company has been prosecuted after spreading 2,023 tonnes of liquid waste in Doncaster and Worksop without permits in place. Sheffield company must pay £38,000 for illegally spreading waste  Environment Agency On 23 February 2015 former company director Timothy Rowley and Tank Industrial Maintenance Limited pleaded guilty at Nottingham Crown Court to eight offences that related to illegal land spreading activities at two farms in Doncaster and Worksop between February 2013 and September 2013. In addition, Tank Industrial Maintenance Limited pleaded guilty to a further offence of failing to ensure that land spreading activities were overseen by a technically competent person. The charges were brought by the Environment Agency under the Environmental Permitting (England & Wales) Regulations 2010. Tank Industrial Maintenance Limited, based in Killamarsh, Sheffield, and now under new management, was fined a total of £20,000 and ordered to pay prosecution costs of £18,000, totalling £38,000. Timothy Rowley aged 39 from Wales Kiveton, Sheffield, was disqualified as a director for 4 years, fined £1,000 and ordered to pay a contribution towards prosecution costs of £572.00 in view of his limited means. Prosecuting for the Environment Agency, Counsel Mr Christopher Stables told the Court that Tank Industrial Maintenance Limited, a company specialising in the removal of liquid food waste, spread approximately 2,023 tonnes of liquid waste to fields at Baxter Farm, Doncaster and Clumber Farm, Worksop without a deployment form being agreed by the Environment Agency. The company had an environmental permit that allowed them to spread food waste to land for agricultural benefit. However, it was a condition of the environmental permit that a deployment form was submitted and agreed by the Environment Agency before any land spreading activities took place. In respect of Baxter Farm, land spreading activities occurred in February 2013 after a deployment form had expired in January 2013. In respect of Clumber Farm, Worksop, land spreading occurred between July 2013 and September 2013 before a deployment form had been considered and processed by the Environment Agency. That deployment application was later rejected by the Environment Agency. At all times, Timothy Rowley was in charge of land spreading operations in his capacity as director. In order to maintain the company’s contracts with the waste producers, he had taken a commercial decision to spread food waste to land as the company had collected too much liquid waste from the producers. Due to a combination of inadequate storage capacity and inclement weather conditions, the company found itself with excessive liquid waste and nowhere for it to go. In these circumstances, the company took the commercial decision to spread the waste to land illegally despite having no agreed deployment application in place. The defendants put profit ahead of compliance with their legal responsibilities. The court heard that prior to these offences, the Environment Agency served a warning letter on Tank Industrial Maintenance Limited for spreading without a deployment being agreed in December 2012. Despite a warning from the Environment Agency, the company continued to spread waste to land and, in respect of Clumber Farm, spread on four separate occasions. During the land spreading operations, there was no technically competent person overseeing the operations, a requirement under the Environmental Permitting (England & Wales) Regulations 2010. In mitigation, the Court was told that in respect of Baxter Farm, the defendants did not realise that the deployment had expired and, in respect of Clumber Farm, had to spread the waste because the Environment Agency was, in the view of the company, taking too long to process the deployment application. The environmental impact caused as result of the offences was limited and localised. Timothy Rowley had resigned as a director since the incidents occurred. In passing sentence, His Honour Judge Hamilton stated that the defendants should not have acted in the way they did and that they spread waste to land in order to save contracts with food processing companies. The sentence imposed on the company included an element designed to remove from the company any profit made from this illegal activity. After the sentencing by the Court, Environment Management Team Leader Richard Moore said: “This company was given a warning and still didn’t comply. Our rules are in place for a good reason and to ensure that any waste that is spread is done correctly and managed in a way that protects the environment. We will not hesitate to take enforcement action in future for those who breach their permits and refuse to co-operate. “I hope this case sends out a message to other land spreading operators and farmers who receive waste, that we take land spreading offences very seriously. “It should also highlight to operators who rely on spreading waste to land the importance of having contingency plans in place to allow them to cope with extreme weather and other disruptions to their operations. “And I would urge farmers who receive waste to find out what is going on on their land. Wastes can be beneficial but they must be spread correctly and in accordance with the regulations.” Further guidance for farmers is available at http://www.nfuonline.com/land-spreading_v3/."
/government/news/enforcement-action-taken-to-remove-unregistered-vessels,"Boaters reminded to renew registrations. Enforcement action taken to remove unregistered vessels  Environment Agency Boaters are reminded to renew their registration before 1 April 2015 or risk their vessel being removed from Environment Agency waterways. The Environment Agency has started an annual programme to remove dangerous and unregistered vessels from the Anglian Waterways. One unregistered boat has been removed from the River Wissey in Norfolk and there are plans to remove more vessels over the coming weeks. All vessels kept, used or let for hire on Environment Agency waterways, including the main river, private moorings, marinas or backwaters, must be registered. As part of the registration process the vessel owner must have the appropriate safety certificates and relevant insurance. If a vessel is not registered the Environment Agency cannot be sure it is safe; therefore these vessels could be a potential hazard to other boat users. They may also be a pollution risk and have negative impacts on wildlife. Candy Reed, the Environment Agency’s Enforcement and Partnerships Officer said: “If you keep, use or let for hire a vessel on any Anglian Waterway you must display a valid registration disc and registration number. Failure to register your vessel is a criminal offence, you may be prosecuted and risk having your vessel removed. We will also look to recover our costs wherever possible from the vessel owner”. Owners who fail to renew their registration will receive written warnings and final notices are issued in the form of a ‘yellow sticker’. The ‘yellow sticker’ demands vessel owners prove the vessel is registered. If no proof of registration is provided within 28 days, then the Environment Agency will consider removing the vessel from the water. If a vessel changes ownership it is the owner’s responsibility to inform the Environment Agency in writing of the new owner; until this is done, they remain the legal owner and responsible for registering it. Vessel registration charges are crucial for maintaining the 568km of Anglian Waterway navigable rivers, lock sites and other navigation facilities. The Environment Agency routinely inspects locks, moorings and other structures to make sure they are in good condition. Larger projects such as lock refurbishments are also carried out normally during the winter months. Recent prosecutions for those who have failed to register their vessels include the following: Martin Griffiths of Church End, Donnington, Spalding Fined £228, costs £250 and victim surcharge £22 Andrew Keller of Blackthorn Lake Marina, Station Road, Ringstead, Kettering Fined £870, costs £250 and victim surcharge £87 William Kidd of Hills and Hollows, Barnwell Road, Oundle Fined £870, costs £250 and victim surcharge £87 Steve Thompson of Kestrel Lane, Wellingborough Fined £150, costs £250 and victim surcharge £20 John Williams of Sedop Close, Saffron Walden Pleaded guilty by post and was fined £250, pay costs of £250 and victim surcharge of £20 For more advice on how to register a vessel contact the Environment Agency on 03708 506 506, email boatreg , write to Environment Agency, Boat Registration, PO Box 544, Rotherham, S60 1BY or visit the following website www.gov.uk/register-a-boat"
/government/news/drop-in-to-learn-about-next-phase-of-work-on-whittlesey-washes-flood-reservoir,"With the next phase of a project to strengthen the bank of Whittlesey Washes starting this month, people who live and work nearby are being invited to a drop-in session to learn more. Drop in to learn about next phase of work on Whittlesey Washes flood reservoir  Environment Agency Maps, plans, drawings and pictures will be on display from 11am to 7.30pm on Wednesday, 11 March at the Scout headquarters, Thistle Drive, off Wessex Close in Stanground, Peterborough. Members of the project team will be available to answer questions. Whittlesey Washes, also known as the Nene Washes, stores water from the River Nene when it is ‘tide-locked’. This happens when heavy rainfall increases river flows and coincides with high tides, meaning the extra water cannot be released through the Dog in a Doublet sluice. As the tide recedes, water is released from the reservoir and into the tidal River Nene through the Ring’s End sluice. The 3 year, £26m Environment Agency-led scheme will strengthen a 16km stretch of the South Barrier Bank. The third phase of the works – between Stanground and Whittlesey – will start on 9 March. Guy Szomi, Environment Agency catchment engineer, said: This vital work will improve the condition of the South Barrier Bank so it can continue to protect hundreds of homes, roads, and railways in and around Peterborough, as well as 8,000 hectares of farmland to the southeast of the city. Anyone who has questions or is just interested in learning more is welcome to attend our drop-in session and meet the project team – we’re happy to help. Phase 3 will strengthen the 3-kilometre stretch of bank between Stanground and Ball Bridge in Whittlesey. A low, 249-metre concrete wall will be built between Stanground Sluice and the car park. While the work is underway, a signed diversion will be in place for a section of the Green Wheel cycle path (route 21) until 30 November. Construction works are set to be complete by the end of the year. Bank work will also continue between Poplar House Farm and Bassenhally.

/government/publications/assessing-the-impact-of-exposure-to-microplastics-in-fish,"Research to assess the potential impacts of microplastics on fish. Assessing the impact of exposure to microplastics in fish  Environment Agency This report presents the findings of research undertaken by Portsmouth University on behalf of the Environment Agency to assess the potential impacts on fish of microplastics in the aquatic environment. Each year approximately 245 million tonnes of plastic are used globally. This production volume, coupled with high durability, has led to widespread accumulation of discarded plastic in landfills and as litter in terrestrial and aquatic habitats worldwide. Once in the environment, plastic debris progressively fragments into smaller pieces. These minute fragments of plastic debris, termed microplastics (particles of plastics with dimensions less than 5 mm) can comprise as much as 85% of plastic debris in the environment. Manufactured microplastics from consumer products, such as cosmetics and industrial abrasives, also enter the aquatic environment. Plastic debris, particularly microplastics, can be consumed by a variety of animals, including fish, which mistake particles for food. This may lead to blocking of the intestinal tract and/or starvation through stomach filling. There is also evidence that microplastics may act as a vector transferring potentially harmful chemicals through the food chain. This research project used sticklebacks as a model organism in three experiments to assess the potential impacts of microplastics on fish."
/government/publications/phosphorus-cycling-in-rivers,"Development of a decision support tool to help screen rivers for sediment-bound phosphorus being released in to river water. Phosphorus cycling in rivers  Environment Agency This research describes the development of a decision support tool to help screen rivers in England for the likelihood and extent of sediment-bound phosphorus being released back to the river water. Soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) is one of the parameters used to determine the ecological status of a river. The impact of high concentrations of SRP in rivers includes a shift in the composition and abundance of plant species present, which has an impact on the river’s overall ecology. This is one of the most significant causes of water bodies such as rivers not achieving good ecological status under the Water Framework Directive. The screening tool described in this report will help the Environment Agency and its partners to target resources and identify measures to reduce phosphorus levels in rivers to meet water quality standards."
/government/news/sunshine-company-skipped-the-rules,"Company director Glen Roy Davis has been fined £4,080 for running an illegal skip business in Basildon.     Sunshine company skipped the rules  Environment Agency Trading as Sunshine Skips Ltd he ran the business at Marsh Farm on Vange by-pass without an environmental permit, putting the environment at risk. He pleaded guilty today (Thurs) at Chelmsford Magistrates’ Court and was ordered to pay £3,000 towards costs. The court heard that his company ran the site illegally under his directorship between March and June 2013. Between June and November he let a friend run the business for him during which time waste was stored and burned at another site in London Road, Pitsea. He was charged with not preventing another person breaching environmental rules. Mrs Miriam Tordoff prosecuting for the Environment Agency said in March 2013 an officer visited Marsh Farm and found about 100 cu metres of waste in 17 skips and about the same amount on the ground. The site was not suitable for the type of business run there as any pollutants could be washed into the soil by rainwater. Agency officers went to the site again in April with an officer from Essex County Council. Similar amounts of waste were found. A letter was sent to Davis and his company telling them to stop operating and to clear the site within four weeks. An extension had to be given. While much of the waste was cleared, Davis failed to clear all the waste within the agreed deadlines. Davis told investigators that he hired out skips to builders and that waste was usually taken to a registered site but was sometimes stored for a couple of days at his site. He was unaware that he needed permission to operate a waste site. Officers also visited land at Bull Farm, in London Road, Pitsea in June 2013 and saw several Sunshine skips full of waste. One of them had waste burning in it. Three months later they responded to reports of burning at the site but found none. Davis left a friend to run his business from June to November 2013 until he sold it, the court heard. Sunshine Skips Ltd was dissolved on 6 May 2014. In mitigation, Davis’ barrister accepted that Davis had been negligent but had been naïve about the rules. He said Davis had not deliberately cut corners for financial gain. Some of the waste at Marsh Farm belonged to other operators at the site, he said. After the hearing Environment Agency officer Sylvie Fung said: Anyone who disposes, transports or treats waste has a duty of care to ensure it is handled correctly. Davis made no attempt to contact us when he began to operate at Marsh Farm to find out what permissions he needed and allowed his friend to operate his business on his behalf. Illegal waste sites such as these not only undermine legitimate businesses but can also result in environmental harm. We are always happy to advise waste businesses on relevant registrations or permits if they ask. Charges: Between 19 March 2013 and 20 June 2013 on land at Marsh Farm, Vange by-pass, Basildon, Essex SS16 4QG Sunshine Skips Limited did with your consent or connivance or attributable to neglect on your part as a director of Sunshine Skips Limited, operate a regulated facility, namely a waste operation for the deposit and storage of waste, without being authorised by an environmental permit granted under Regulation 13 of the Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2010.

/government/news/somerset-farm-fined-for-polluting-a-tributary-of-the-wellow-brook,"Farming partnership Brunt Brothers of Clandown Farm, Clandown, near Radstock, Somerset, offer of a £5,000 donation to an environmental charity for polluting a tributary of the Wellow Brook river in Somerset has been accepted by the Environment Agency. Somerset farm offers £5,000 civil sanction for polluting river  Environment Agency The partnership has offered to pay an enforcement undertaking in the form of a donation following a major pollution incident in Clandown on 2 February 2013, when the slurry store at the farm failed. This resulted in approximately 150,000 gallons of slurry surging across a yard, over a four foot wall, and spilling on to the highway and farm track. Such was the surge and volume of slurry released that it travelled over 100 metres downhill and into the fields immediately downstream. It entered the main Wellow Brook in the nearby town of Radstock, killing 100 trout and a small number of other species. There were 3 angling clubs on the affected stretch some of which had actively been involved in habitat work to encourage wild brown trout to thrive. The farmers managed to recover an estimated 50 % of the slurry spilled by scraping the roads, tracks and fields. Officers from the Environment Agency attended the incident and found the slurry 15cm deep on the road. The farmers were already taking steps to clear up the slurry and prevent further pollution of the watercourse.They had recently invested in expanding their slurry storage capacity in order to comply with the Nitrate Regulations. Along with prosecutions, the Environment Agency use enforcement notices, stop notices and civil sanctions to either improve performance or stop sites from operating. It is making better use of the wide range of measures that are available to bring sites back into compliance as quickly as possible. Civil sanctions such as these are a proportionate and cost-effective way for businesses to make amends for less serious environmental offences. The enforcement undertaking for environment offences was accepted by the Agency. In any enforcement undertaking, the person or company should offer to restore or remediate the harm caused by the incident where that is possible. They may also make a financial contribution to a recognised environmental charity or project to achieve environmental benefit. The wrongdoer must also demonstrate they will change their behaviour and ensure compliance with environmental legislation. Brunt Bros offered to: make improvements to its slurry store and ensure compliance with the relevant legislation pay £5,000 to Bristol Avon Rivers Trust (BART) for work in the catchment payment of Environment Agency costs Failure to comply with an enforcement undertaking may result in the person or company being prosecuted for the offence. Paula Sage for the Environment Agency said: We did initially consider prosecution due to the serious environmental harm the slurry had caused. However, the partnership then submitted an Enforcement Undertaking, which we subsequently accepted, as we considered it was a more proportionate response and that it would achieve more for the environment than if the partnership had been convicted and fined.

Jonathan Cummings, of Northlands, Chester-le-Street, was found guilty in his absence by North Durham magistrates on 17 March 2015 of an offence under local byelaws. He was fined £110 and ordered to pay £120 costs and £20 victim surcharge. The court warned him that he could be banned from fishing if he appeared again. Environment Agency fisheries enforcement officers caught Cummings fishing in the prohibited area below Framwellgate Dam on the River Wear in Durham on 5 August 2014. The prohibited area is intended to provide protection to fish that congregate below weirs when travelling to their spawning grounds, Environment Agency fisheries enforcement team leader Kevin Summerson said: These byelaws are important for the protection of all species of fish, in particular at times when they are attempting to migrate upstream to reach spawning grounds. Offences of this type can have a serious effect on the spawning at a time when salmon and trout are perceived to be in decline on many of the rivers in England."

River Medway boaters fined  Environment Agency Craig Phillips, of Leyton Cross Road, Wilmington, was fined £200 with costs of £115, a compensation order of £189.84, and a victim surcharge of £20 at Maidstone Magistrates’ Court on 19 March after failing to apply for a boat registration. His vessel “RIO” was seen on 22 June 2014 at Twyford Bridge Marina, Yalding, not displaying a valid Registration Certificate. Mr Philips was made aware he needed to comply with the Environment Agency’s boat registration requirements; however he failed to do so. Also at Maidstone Magistrates’ Court on the same date, Mr Andrew Handley, of Carrington Close, Gillingham, was found guilty in his absence and fined £200 with costs of £115 and a victim surcharge of £15. His vessel “Sea Major” was seen on 23 June 2014 at Bow Bridge Marina, Wateringbury, not displaying a valid Registration Certificate. Mr Handley had cancelled the direct debit to pay for his registration and although he eventually paid the outstanding balance, he did not submit his insurance details to the Environment Agency Boat Registration Team, which is a requirement of powered vessel registrations. Rebecca Cox, Environment Agency Waterways Officer said, “These results highlight how important it is for river users to ensure their payment and licence details are kept up to date. We carry out regular patrols on the River Medway, so owners of boats not adhering to the regulation could face prosecution. “The revenue the Environment Agency receives from vessel licensing is used to fund our annual maintenance programme along the River Medway and maintain our locks, moorings, toilets and showers. We are lucky to have such a popular and well known public right of navigation in Kent that is enjoyed by so many. By not complying, the revenue is lost, threatening the future of this great waterway.” Ends Notes to editors: All media enquiries: 0118 953 5555; Out of hours 0800 141 2743 Please ask for the duty press officer.

/government/news/new-plans-to-improve-our-local-river-environments-only-4-weeks-left-to-share-your-views-and-ideas,"The Environment Agency has recently set out plans for how water in the South West will be looked after from 2016 to 2021. And, after a consultation lasting 6 months, there are only 4 weeks left to have your say on how else we can improve and protect the local water environments across the South West.     New plans to improve our local river environments: only 4 weeks left to share your views and ideas  Environment Agency Water and water environments are essential for life and livelihoods. The average person in the UK uses 150 litres of water every day in their home. But, if you also include all the water used in growing and manufacturing the things we all use or consume, each of us uses an average of around 4,600 litres (over 1,000 gallons) of water per day. Rivers, lakes, estuaries, coastal areas, wetlands and groundwater provide many benefits; they supply drinking water, support fisheries and provide an essential resource for business and agriculture as well as providing transport links and social benefits. Since the first River Basin Management Plan was written back in 2009, 335 kilometres of river and 19 hectares of lakes have been improved. This has resulted in improved wildlife (fish, plants and insects) and a reduction in the amount of chemicals in the water (ammonia, metals and organic pollutants). And over 2,200 investigations have also been completed by the Environment Agency to improve the understanding of the remaining problems and what might be done to resolve them. ‘Plans written by the Environment Agency set out actions which need to be taken to ensure that we continue to improve the water environment for people and wildlife even more. The water quality of our rivers, lakes and coasts has improved significantly over recent years, but there is much more that we can do.

Gauging the health of Old Basing’s ‘green corridor’  Environment Agency Installed in two locations in Old Basing with £50,000 of funding from Basingstoke and Deane Borough Council, the gauges will transmit information on the amount of water in the river, and the rate at which it is flowing, to the Environment Agency’s hydrometry team in Wallingford, Oxfordshire. Analysed as part of a basket of environmental data, this vital additional information will help present a far more detailed picture of the existing health of the river and inform future projects to improve and protect this important ‘green corridor’ through the town. Since the latter half of the twentieth century, society has been waking up to the damage that industrialisation and urbanisation has wrought on our rivers. said The Environment Agency’s Mark Barnett. At the same time, our appreciation of them as crucial elements of eco-systems, ‘green corridors’ sustaining an abundance of plant and animal life well beyond their own banks, and sources of recreation and well-being for ourselves, has grown. Today, there’s a tremendous amount of work going on to restore and protect rivers. But as our population continues to increase, so does the size of the challenge. With good environmental data we can work in a far smarter and effective way than we can without it – using it to pinpoint issues and their solutions. With the introduction of these new gauges, we will have access to more detailed data on the Loddon than ever before.” Maria Miller MP said: I am delighted that these new flow gauges have been installed on the River Loddon. This enhanced monitoring will help ensure the Loddon can be better safeguarded against the impacts of any future development – an issue I am passionate about.” Cllr Hayley Eachus said: The borough council is pleased to be funding this important project which will improve water quality information in the River Loddon. We have worked closely with the Environment Agency in the development of our Local Plan. This investment will mean close monitoring can be carried out as part of the Environment Agency’s annual programme to ensure water quality is protected.” If you want to know more about what is happening in your river and get involved please contact either Mark Barnett or Amanda Ingham . Notes to Editor Throughout the River Loddon catchment, partnership working between the Environment Agency, Basingstoke and Deane Borough Council, Hampshire & Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust, local angling groups and many others has delivered a number of projects that have helped improved water quality , seen habitats for wildlife regenerated and improved upstream access for fish past redundant weirs.

/government/news/a-flowing-success-loddon-rivers-week,"The River Loddon was given another week of environmental enhancement and conservation as part of the ‘Loddon Rivers Week’ partnership project. A flowing success - Loddon Rivers Week  Environment Agency The initiative is led by the Environment Agency in partnership with the Wild Trout Trust, Blackwater Valley Countryside Partnership, Loddon Valley Residents Association, Loddon Fisheries and Conservation Consultative and the Wildlife Trust. The week kicked off last Monday, 16 March, with electro-fishing at Whitewater Mill, Bassett’s Mead, Potbridge and North Warnborough where trout, perch, chub, minnow and bullhead were caught. Electrofishing uses electricity to stun fish so they can be easily caught, it is a common scientific survey method used to sample fish populations and collect valuable data. The process does not harm the fish, which return to their natural state in as little as two minutes after being stunned. The week progressed with volunteers from the local community, conservation and flood groups working together over two days, to improve the river’s habitats and enhancing the Loddon’s natural processes using low cost and simple techniques; demonstrated by Environment Agency fisheries officers and the Wild Trout Trust. Karen Twine, Fisheries Officer for the Environment Agency said: Our volunteers really got stuck in by making fagotts, cleaning gravels, adding new gravels, introducing and securing woody debris in the Blackwater. These techniques will help fish and invertebrate communities, offering refuge from high flows and predators as well as improve spawning and nursery habitat. Brash faggots – which consist of bundles of branches or coppice - were made up and staked in to support the re-profiled river bank. This technique will help to increase the capacity of the channel, without compromising the natural processes occurring within the river. It will also enhance riparian habitat for other wildlife including birds, butterflies, dragonflies and bees. On Friday, a workshop was set up by the Loddon Valley Residents Association and Loddon Fisheries and Conservation Consultative, which gave the local communities, land owners and Councils the chance to visualise (with the help of an EmRiver model, which simulates river processes) how flood risk can be managed using natural processes such as floodplain connectivity, flood water storage and retention, which can also help to regulate erosion and deposition. Karen Twine added: It’s been fantastic to see so many volunteers and interest groups coming together to improve this much loved river. It is essential to get the message across that managing flood risk can be achieved without compromising our beautiful rivers. The Loddon catchment is environmentally rich and an important resource for wildlife which needs protecting and enhancing for future generations.

Gateshead man allowed unlicensed vehicle dismantling  Environment Agency A Gateshead man has admitted to knowingly permitting unlicensed vehicle dismantling to take place on land he was renting. Paul McKenzie allowed Tyne Auto to trade from a site in Brewery Lane, Gateshead, which contained more than 200 wheels and tyres, assorted engines, exhausts and other vehicle parts. He was told repeatedly by the Environment Agency to stop dismantling vehicles on the land but continued operating without a permit in place designed to protect the environment. McKenzie, 44, of Queen Square, Gateshead, pleaded guilty to a charge against Environmental Permitting Regulations when he appeared at Sunderland Magistrates Court on Thursday, May 7. He was sentenced to a 12 month community order and 250 hours of unpaid work, as well as being ordered to pay £2,000 costs. Counsel Andrea Parnham, acting on behalf of the Environment Agency, told the court that the site was visited on several occasions when evidence was gathered to show what was going on there. On one visit officers saw the defendant with a recovery truck which was hitched to a Volkswagen car. On another visit officers found a car on its side that had been set alight. Checks on a number of vehicles on the Brewery Lane site identified at least seven of them had been sold for scrap as MOT failures or “write offs”.These vehicles had been disposed of by contacting Tyne Autos through one of a number of websites. McKenzie had originally claimed the cars belonged to his cousin and were going to be restored or repaired. He challenged the need for an environmental permit, saying he was simply “moving second hand cars around the site”.

Work begins in Essex on new internationally important wetland  Environment Agency The estuary has national and international designations due to its conservation importance and has recently been included in the Marine Conservation Zone designation. Coastal habitats that make it special include tidal mudflats, saltmarshes and coastal grazing marsh in Essex. Around 80% of the coastal marshes have been lost and the remaining are disappearing at an alarming rate. The project, which is a partnership between the Trust and the Agency, will see 22 hectares of new intertidal habitat created by breaching the existing seawall – allowing the tide to enter the site. The habitat will be a mix of saltmarsh, mudflat and saline lagoon, with a further 1.5 hectares of new reedbed. Once planning permission was granted in 2013, the Trust’s supporters raised over £125,000 to buy the land for the project. A number of key funders and donors also supported the acquisition. Andy May, Conservation Manager for Essex Wildlife Trust said: “This is a very exciting project, which will make much-loved Fingringhoe Wick even better for wildlife and people. We are really looking forward to working in partnership again with the Environment Agency to bring this important work to fruition.” Charles Beardall, Area Manager for the Environment Agency said: “We’re delighted to be involved in this partnership with Essex Wildlife Trust, and so pleased that our workforce is playing such a huge part in creating this new internationally important habitat.” Over the next four months new seawalls will be built to the north and south of the proposed intertidal habitat and it is hoped the breach will be created in the autumn. The new wetland will also include: new nursery areas for marine fish, Little Tern nesting islands, a new bird hide and new public footpaths on this previously private part of the estuary. Among other species to benefit will be Black-tailed Godwit, Dark-bellied Brent Goose, Lapwing, Bittern, Water Vole and a range of dragonflies."

/government/news/otter-found-dead-in-illegal-trap-on-selby-canal,"Illegal crayfish trap kills protected species. Otter found dead in illegal trap on Selby Canal  Environment Agency An otter has drowned after getting caught up in an illegal crayfish trap by the Selby Canal. The trap was found on an angling platform at a fishing peg on the canal just outside Selby in North Yorkshire. It was discovered by a member of the public who reported the find to the police and the Environment Agency. It is believed that the illegal net was being used to catch crayfish. Although crayfish traps are widely available, consent from the Environment Agency is required to set the traps legally. Approval would only ever be given if the traps conformed to strict size dimensions and had an otter guard fitted to prevent the animal getting into the trap. Ian Marshall, biodiversity officer at the Environment Agency said: “Otters are protected by law and killing them could result in a fine of up to £5,000 or six months in prison. Their return to our rivers is an environmental success story and we do a lot of work to encourage their recovery. “Anyone wanting to trap crayfish must have the relevant permits from the Environment Agency. Just because a trap is marketed for crayfish use does not mean it is of a legal design. Otter guards can be fitted to non-legal traps to prevent tragedies like this happening again.” Fisheries officers have recovered the body which will be sent off for analysis. Otter populations have begun to expand across the country following a decline in numbers between the 1950s and 1980s. The return of otters to our rivers reflects improvements in river habitats and water quality, which are now at their healthiest for more than 20 years. Given that numbers are still recovering, otters are legally protected. The Environment Agency’s fisheries enforcement officers routinely look out for evidence of illegal traps, but if you see anything suspicious please report it to the Environment Agency’s incident hotline on 0800 80 70 60.

Facts of the offence The Environment Agency became aware of the illegal storage of waste on the site on 19 June 2012 and instructed E2L to remove the waste and cease operating in this area until the correct permits had been obtained. E2L do hold an environmental permit for waste operations on land adjacent to the site in question, which demonstrates that they were aware of the legal requirements. Prior to this E2L submitted a planning application to develop a waste washing facility at the site which would enable them to recycle some of the waste. The Environment Agency agreed any further enforcement action would be put on hold pending the outcome of the planning application. In late March 2013, the Environment Agency was informed by Herefordshire Council that E2Ls planning application had been refused. Therefore the Environment Agency reinstated the enforcement action and contacted E2L requesting they put forward a timetable for removal of the waste. E2L confirmed at the end of May 2013 that they would be able to remove all the waste within 6 months, therefore the Environment Agency served a notice requiring that the site be cleared of all illegally stored material by 30 November 2013. E2L later requested that the deadline be extended until 31 January 2014, which was granted. On 2 December 2013, Environment Agency officers noticed fresh waste had been tipped on the site despite E2L knowing this was illegal. On 31 January 2014, the date for final compliance with the notice, there were still 3 large heaps of waste amounting to around 12,000 tonnes on site. The situation had not improved by 29 April 2014 and it was apparent that fresh waste had been deposited on the site. By 19 August 2014 only half of the waste had been removed, leaving 6,000 tonnes still being stored on the site illegally. The adjacent watercourse, the Red Brook, was partially blocked by silt and debris as a result of the operations on the site. Comments made during sentencing Speaking after the case, an Environment Agency officer in charge of the investigation said: “E2L were fully aware of their obligations to comply with the environmental permitting rules but chose to ignore them. For over two years E2L did not take the Environment Agency’s continuous interventions seriously and failed to remove the illegally stored waste, instead they continued to deposit fresh waste on the site which left prosecution the only possible course of action. We take waste crime extremely seriously and will not hesitate to prosecute in cases such as this.“ The Court said it was disappointed that the remainder of the waste had not been removed by the time of the hearing and ordered that the site be cleared within 3 months. In mitigation, the court was told that the company had pleaded guilty at the first opportunity."
/government/news/taking-stock-of-fish-on-the-nene,"Work will begin next week to count the number and type of fish in a stretch of the river Nene. Taking stock of fish on the Nene  Environment Agency Funded with income from rod licence sales, the Environment Agency will be carrying out surveys between Clifford Hill and Ferry Meadows from Monday 15 June until Wednesday 19 July. Fisheries experts will be taking note of the amount of fish, as well as their size, species and age. The results are a vital indicator of the river’s quality under the European Water Framework Directive, and can reveal changes to the habitat. Findings can also be used to help shape local projects to improve the environment for wildlife, visitors and anglers alike. Environmental monitoring officer Andy Beal said: “Counting fish in a river sounds like a mammoth task, but it’s actually relatively simple. We put out two stretches of net 100 metres apart and take two hauls of the fish swimming between. “We then measure them, check their species, and count their scales to determine their age – similar to counting the rings on a tree – before letting them go again. “It’s a process that’s repeated several times throughout the year, giving us consistent and accurate results that show how healthy the water is – and how happy the fish are!” Boaters using the river while the surveys are taking place are asked to look out for signs, navigate carefully, and be aware that there may be slight delays while the nets are in the river. Andy added: “I’d like to thank people in advance for their patience while we carry out this essential work. We’ll do our best to keep any delays to a minimum and apologise for any inconvenience caused.” For more information, contact the Environment Agency on 03708 506 506 between 9am and 5pm, and ask for the Anglian Waterways team."

/government/news/country-durham-man-fined-for-waste-offences,"A man has been fined after pleading guilty to running an illegal waste site on land in County Durham.  County Durham man fined for waste offences  Environment Agency Following an investigation by the Environment Agency, James Ian Campbell, 56, of Plantation View, Howden Le Wear in Crook, appeared at Darlington Magistrates Court on Wednesday, May 27, where he pleaded guilty to a charge against environmental permitting regulations. He was fined £550, ordered to pay costs of £800 and a victim surcharge of £55. Acting on behalf of the Environment Agency, solicitor Nigel Augustin told the court the site at Stanley Moss, between Sunniside and Crook, was used to import waste, segregate it into valuable parts that could be sold on and dispose of waste that had no value by burning it. During site visits in the summer of 2014, Environment Agency officers saw items including mattresses, a large number of car tyres, metal springs and frames had been burned, and saw stripped down washing machines, cookers, fridges and a television. On speaking to Campbell, he said the waste on the site was there because he’d loaded it from his vehicle, which was off the road, and he would clear the site when his vehicle was repaired. He added he had a licence for the scrap metal and only burned wood and cardboard. He was advised the licence would allow him to carry scrap metal but not to store, deposit or dispose of mixed waste. He was advised of the steps to take to ensure he had the correct permits in place to bring his activities within the law. But in September 2014, a further site visit saw in excess of fifty car and heavy goods vehicle tyres at the site. Waste crime has a detrimental effect on local communities and the environment and can undermine legitimate businesses. Anyone who has information about waste crimes can call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."

Magna Carta celebrations  Environment Agency The Environment Agency is looking forward to playing an active role in this month’s Magna Carta anniversary celebrations taking place on and close to the River Thames. Over the weekend of 13 and 14 June 2015, the River Thames will be host to a community event which will include a spectacular two day river relay and pageant from Hurley to Runnymede. On Monday 15 June a national celebration will also take place close to the river on Runnymede Meadows. In our role as navigation authority, the Environment Agency is committed to support the event organisers and community partners in making the celebrations a success. Some river restrictions will be in place across the three days with heavier than normal river traffic expected between Hurley Lock and Bell Weir Lock on 13/14 June. As the navigation authority we will be maintaining a clear channel and limiting the disruption to all river users during the event, whether they are taking part or passing through. On Sunday 14 June the pageant event will be using a buoyed channel in front of the Runnymede Pleasure Grounds on the south, Egham side of the river. From 08.00 to 18.00 regatta boards will mark the navigation channel which will be established on the north, Wraysbury side of the river. The event on Monday 15 June has been organised by the Magna Carta 800 Committee. To support a Surrey Police request for the safety and security of boats using the river on the Runnymede reach, there will be a short period river closure from 09.00 until 11.45 from the Bells of Ouzeley public house to the Runnymede Pleasure Grounds. The weekend relay and pageant will see the Queen’s Row Barge, the Gloriana, lead the way for boats from local clubs and organisations between reaches. The flotilla will feature a mix of powered, unpowered, vintage and new vessels of various sizes. The pageant will grow in size as it makes its way towards the final destination, Runnymede Pleasure Grounds. As the pageant moves down the river, it will stop at several locations for ‘playlets’ which will re-enact important historical scenes. Andrew Graham, Waterways Manager for the Environment Agency said: We are proud to support this wonderful event which celebrates the sealing of the Magna Carta beside the Thames. We have taken the needs of boaters and community partners into full account when developing our navigation restrictions, to strike a sensible balance between the needs of the event and the rights of our customers. There may be limited availability of some public moorings on the reach during the events, if you plan to moor on the reach during this time we advise you to check availability before you depart. We know that all responsible boaters will respect and comply with our restrictions and in doing so, will be doing their bit in making this event enjoyable for all.

/government/news/fish-thriving-in-bardney-refuges,"Improvements to Bardney Moorings are proving a big attraction for fish on the Witham – making the river’s environment even better. Fish thriving in Bardney refuges  Environment Agency New structures have been attached to the underside of the moorings, giving fish a sheltered place to thrive. And thriving habitats are a great place for wildlife and visitors alike. The eight ‘refuges’ offer fish a hiding place from predators, a comfortable area to spawn, and a safe harbour when higher-than-normal water levels put them at risk of being washed away. It has been just three months since the project was completed by the Environment Agency, the Canal and River Trust and the Lincolnshire Rivers Trust but it is already proving a success, boosting the number of fish in the area. Environment Agency catchment co-ordinator David Hutchinson said: “Underwater sonar images have revealed thousands of small roach fish. “Over time, these will grow and move to other areas of the river, benefiting the Witham’s ecological status, as well as the catch for local anglers.” The number of fish in the river also contributes to its classification under the European Water Framework Directive. David added: “To get a consistently good classification, we need to have lots of fish – and a good variety of them – right along the river. “Projects like this help habitats to thrive. And a thriving river is good for the environment, good for people, and good for the local economy.” The refuges at Bardney Moorings are part of a series of improvements to the habitat along the river Witham between Bardney and Boston. It is hoped similar schemes can be carried out in the future at further moorings along the river."

/government/news/fish-survey-reveals-huge-variety-in-river-thames,"The variety of fish which live in the River Thames has been highlighted by an Environment Agency fisheries survey along the river. Fish survey reveals huge variety in River Thames  Environment Agency The survey found dace, smelt and common bream, as well as marine species such as sea bass and flounder. A variety of invertebrates, which are an important food source, and some rare and unexpected fish, such as pogges were also discovered. Specialist fisheries teams surveyed fish populations at 8 locations on the tidal Thames, between Gravesend and Richmond, and identified 17 different species in total. Fisheries teams have been collecting fisheries data from the tidal Thames since the 1960s, and the information is used to get a picture of the health of the river and protect fish. Environment Agency River Thames surveys are supported by volunteers from Zoological Society of London (ZSL). The volunteers joined fisheries officers as they carried out the work, which involved netting off small sections of the river and counting the amount of fish in each section. Peter Gray, Environment Agency Fisheries Officer, said: The surveys provide a valuable snap shot of what species are living in the river. This year we have seen 17 different types of fish in including a really good mix of freshwater and marine juveniles that use the estuary as a valuable nursery area. Joe Pecorelli, Citizen Science Project Manager at ZSL, said: ZSL works with hundreds of citizen science volunteers across the capital to monitor our rivers and take practical action to improve them. The contribution of volunteers has been invaluable to ZSL being able to conserve wildlife in the Thames. Data from their surveys has enabled us to better protect species such as the European eel, allowing us to identify barriers to their migration and build eel passes. ZSL’s conservation efforts are greatly benefited by the Environment Agency’s support and willingness to work in partnership. Helping with this fish survey provided an opportunity for experts in the Agency to impart new skills and knowledge to our team of volunteers. Thanks to this partnership, the volunteers have become an even greater asset to ZSL’s mission to make the capital’s rivers a better place for wildlife and people.

/government/news/new-eel-passes-installed-on-the-bedford-ouse,"4 new eel passes have been installed by the Environment Agency on the Bedford Ouse to help eels migrate to the upper parts of the river.  New eel passes installed on the Bedford Ouse  Environment Agency The eel passes have been installed at sluices between St Ives and Houghton. Eel stocks have been identified as ‘critically low’ in Europe and installation of these new passes should help more of them to get past structures in the Bedford Ouse and on upstream. Helping eels on their fantastic journey Juvenile eels (Leptocephali) start their fantastic journey in the deep waters near the Bermuda triangle, travelling into Europe, with some coming into the English Channel and through the Wash into the Great Ouse and its tributaries. They finally go further upstream to complete the freshwater stage of their lifecycle, which can last up to 60 years. James Dyke Environment Agency Fisheries Officer said: “Getting past structures, such as the St Ives sluice is key for survival of the eels and will make a real difference to their ability to travel further upstream to complete their lifecycle. “With numbers currently so low, they need all the help they can get if we’re going to keep this fascinating species in our rivers.” Work was carried out over 2 years, after the structures between St Ives and Houghton were identified as ‘high priority’ barriers to eel migration. Eels were listed in year 2007 as a critically endangered species, with eel regulations requiring passes to be installed so their migration is not blocked by structures in rivers. The Environment Agency has a key role in ensuring that the biodiversity of our watercourses is enhanced and fish stocks are managed for the benefit of wildlife and people. The organisation has a responsibility to clean up rivers; however everyone has a part to play to help make our water and land more natural and sustainable for people and wildlife.

Shade created by the trees and from erecting fences will help reduce the chances of the river becoming too warm for freshwater wildlife as the result of a changing climate. Trees have been planted as part of a four year ‘Keeping Rivers Cool’ project which combines scientific evidence and practical landscape planning to help freshwater ecosystems cope with changing climates. Environment Agency fisheries expert Rob Clapham said: We’ve had a few relatively hot, dry summers recently where some rivers have reached temperatures too hot for trout to handle. We’re hoping that by doing this work now, we can improve and protect this beautiful stretch of river and develop the wealth of wildlife for many years to come.

/government/news/primitive-fish-return-to-yorkshire-and-the-north-east,"The rare lamprey is returning to the region to spawn. Primitive fish return to Yorkshire and the North East  Environment Agency A rare and protected fish has returned to Yorkshire and the North East for its annual spawning as water quality in the region’s rivers continues to improve. The Environment Agency, working with local angling groups and Natural England, has been surveying the rivers searching for the rare, jawless fish called the lamprey. So far the Environment Agency has identified one spawning site on the River Wear and spotted a total of 20 adult sea lampreys. In Yorkshire, Natural England has a project underway in search for sea lampreys on the River Ouse. River and sea lampreys are also expected to return to spawning grounds on the lower River Wharfe, Swale, Nidd and Ure. The fish are a good indication of the high quality of the river water and scientists are continuing to search for more lampreys on the Wear and the Ouse river catchments. Paul Frear, Environment Agency fisheries officer, said: We welcome the return of the lampreys back to Yorkshire and the North East. The lampreys are like swallows. They return to the same spot to spawn within the same few days every year. These illusive fish are extremely selective with their spawning sites and will only nest where the water quality is good. Their appearance is a ringing endorsement of the water quality in these areas. The lamprey is an extremely unusual creature. The most primitive fish in the world, it uses its mouth like a suction-cup to attach itself to the skin of a fish and rasp away tissue with its sharp probing tongue and teeth. They outwardly resemble eels because they have no scales and an adult lamprey can range anywhere from 13 to 100 centimetres long. They have large eyes, one nostril on the top of their heads, and seven gill pores on each side. Claire Horseman from Natural England said: We are hoping that the lamprey projects being undertaken by Natural England and the Environment Agency will help us better understand the migratory behaviour of these primitive species and the challenges that they face along their migratory route. With this increased understanding we can work towards restoring lamprey populations to their former status. During the Middle Ages lampreys were widely eaten by the upper classes throughout Europe, especially during fasting periods, because their taste is much meatier than that of other fish. The deaths of two English kings, King Henry I and King John, are said to have been from overindulging on these blood-suckers."
/government/news/environment-agency-reveals-secret-seven-fish,"A 400-million-year-old blood-sucking creature once eaten by Vikings tops the Environment Agency’s list of England’s rarest fish. Environment Agency reveals ‘secret seven’ fish  Environment Agency A 400-million-year-old rare blood-sucking creature once eaten by Vikings and a relic from the Ice Age top the Environment Agency’s ‘secret seven’ list of England’s rarest fish, which it unveiled today. Photographs of all seven species can be downloaded on flickr The seven species are lamprey, Arctic charr, vendace, spined loach, allis shad, twaite shad and smelt. All seven species of fish are a conservation priority at a national and international level. The reasons for their previous decline include historically poor water quality, barriers to migration and a changing climate. But now, all seven are starting to thrive again thanks to work by the Environment Agency and other conservation groups. Alastair Driver, Environment Agency national biodiversity manager, said: These rare fish are the unknown jewels of our rivers. The Environment Agency has a range of projects to support them and although England’s rivers are the healthiest for 20 years, there is still more to be done to improve their chances. Reintroducing meanders, breeding fish and removing weirs are among our key work to help these little-known fish thrive. Lampreys are eel-like creatures, once eaten by Vikings, and pre-date dinosaurs by more than 200 million years. Thanks to the lowest levels of pollution seen for more than 100 years and the removal of barriers to their spawning migrations they are returning to many UK rivers. Where barriers cannot be removed, Environment Agency fisheries staff have fitted lamprey ‘tiles’ to existing weirs to help them get upstream. River and sea lamprey have now been found in the Yorkshire Ouse, where only 30 years ago they were absent. But lamprey are very secretive creatures and very little is known about their life at sea. It is widely recognised that the majority of UK Arctic charr populations are in decline with increasing temperatures considered to be one of the greatest threats to their existence in UK waters. In 2005 the Environment Agency, with partners, set about reversing this trend. A barrier to migration was removed and land-use changes were implemented in order to improve water quality in an important charr-spawning stream. Fisheries experts collected ‘broodstock’ from Ennerdale Water and began rearing them at the Kielder Hatchery. The following year the young fish were released and this process continued through to 2013. The charr population showed a marked increase in terms of adult spawners. Now that the population is beginning to show signs of recovery, the project has entered a monitoring phase. The herring-like vendace is the rarest native freshwater fish species in the UK. This silver fish is native to just two English lakes (Derwentwater and Bassenthwaite Lake in Cumbria). Their populations are impacted by lake siltation and the introduction of non-native species. The Environment Agency has been improving river habitats upstream of Derwentwater and working with others to prevent the introduction of more non-native species than could harm the vendace. The spined loach is found in just five river catchments in the east of England – the Trent, Welland, Witham, Nene and Great Ouse. The easterly flowing direction of all these rivers is an indicator of the origins of the species. All these rivers were once a part of the Rhine catchment, at a time when the North Sea was a land mass. But when the North Sea cut off Great Britain off from mainland Europe the spined loach was stranded and hasn’t moved much since. At one time, twaite shad were commonplace throughout the Severn Estuary and its rivers. During the 19th century many rivers were modified which has restricted shad, to the lower reaches of the river by preventing access to their historic spawning habitat. There are only four spawning twaite shad populations in the UK – the rivers Tywi, Usk, Wye and Severn. The Environment Agency is working on a project to secure funding for a project that will open up more than 230 km of historic spawning ground to support shad populations in the Severn Estuary. Allis shad is the twaite shad’s larger cousin and can grow up to four kg in weight. The smelt is a small species of fish, related to trout and salmon, that lives in coastal areas of Britain. By the end of the twentieth century, there were fewer smelt populations, due to the effects of pollution in river estuaries, and the construction of weirs which stop the fish moving upstream to spawn. The situation is improving due to better water quality – investment in sewage treatment has reduced instances of low oxygen levels in estuaries. Work to improve fish passage, by the removal of weirs or the installation of fish passes, has benefitted all species of migrating fish, including smelt. In addition, smelt have been given additional protection by the creation of Marine Protected Areas. ENDS Photographs of all seven species can be downloaded on flickr"

/government/news/family-fishing-fun-as-the-environment-agency-holds-free-events-in-cornwall,"Looking for a fun day out for the family this summer? Why not try a day’s coarse fishing at one of the special angling events being staged across Cornwall. Family fishing fun as the Environment Agency holds free events in Cornwall  Environment Agency The free events are an excellent opportunity for families to try their hand at fishing and discover why angling is the most popular outdoor sport in the country. All equipment is supplied and qualified instructors will be on hand to assist throughout the day. Similar events held last year were so successful, the Environment Agency is organising another series of introductory sessions this summer. The first will be held at Bude Canal Angling Association, Whalesborough Lake near Bude on Friday 24 July. There will be another event at Roche Angling Club Lake near St Blazey on Monday 10 August with a final session at Three Milestone Angling Club Lakes, Threemilestone on Wednesday 12 August. Places are limited so it is important that people book in advance. Call 01208 265012 for booking forms. Sally-Anne Gallop for the Environment Agency said: These are great days out in the Cornish countryside where families can try their hand at fishing and enjoy themselves in safe and attractive surroundings. Last summer’s events were a big hit and we are confident they’ll be just as popular in 2015. We would not be able to run these days without the help of the local Angling clubs and the expert tuition from our coaches. Families signing-up for any of these events will not need to purchase a rod licence. After attending these taster sessions, if anyone becomes ‘hooked’ on the sport and decide to take up coarse fishing, a licence is required by law. A full year’s trout and coarse licence costs £27.00 for an adult and £5.00 for Under 16’s. People can also buy a single day’s licence for only £3.75. Children aged 12 and under do not require a licence. Rod licences can be obtained from the Post Office or by calling the Agency’s telephone sales line 0844 800 5386. Money from rod licence sales is used to improve fishing in England and Wales."

/government/news/eel-y-good-information-gathered-in-surveys,"Work ongoing to halt the decline in eel populations Eel-y good information gathered in surveys  Environment Agency Vital surveys to monitor the endangered eel in the River Wear are being carried out by the Environment Agency. Officers found 138 eels in 100m at Finchale Priory recently – which is noted as being one of the best sites in the area for eels. It’s one of 10 sites on the River Wear which are surveyed every 2 years to assess local stocks. The numbers are consistent with previous surveys carried out in the area. European Eels have been in decline all over Europe over the past 30 years with the number of elvers (young eels) migrating into European rivers falling to less than 5% of 1980s levels. This decline has put the eel on the endangered list and made it the subject of new European legislation which requires member states to implement Eel Management Plans to reverse the decline in the number of adult eels returning to the sea. Eels are long lived, living in freshwater for more than 15 to 20 years before migrating to sea to spawn in the Sargasso sea. The Environment Agency’s Fisheries Technical Officer Robbie Stevenson said: It’s not known exactly why there’s been such a dramatic decline but things which could have impacted include barriers to migration, damage associated with abstractions, disease, pollution and being eaten by predators. We’ve been creating new eel passes and removing obstructions from watercourses to make it easier for them to migrate as well as working with other partners to help reduce impacts on eel. Important monitoring such as this means we can assess the ongoing situation. But it will take several eel generations before it’s known if measures put in place now will have an impact in the future. Finchale Priory is one of 10 sites on the River Wear which are surveyed every 2 years to assess local stocks. 10 sites on the River Coquet are also surveyed every 2 years at alternate years to the Wear. Did you know…? All eel over 30cm are female Eel determine which sex they will become once they reach 10-15cm, depending on how many other eel of each species are present in the population Both the ancient Greeks and Egyptians believed that eels may be gods Aristotle believed that young eel were born from horse hairs, mainly due to the fact that a spawning eel had never been seen and that ‘baby’ eels had never been found All European eel are regarded as a single stock, spawning takes place in the Sargasso Sea, in the Caribbean Young eels are carried on the ocean currents and take 2 years to reach Europe, where they enter freshwater to grow."

/government/news/nonylphenol-ethoxylates-to-be-banned-in-imported-clothing-and-textiles,"Nonylphenol ethoxylates to be banned in imported clothing and textiles Nonylphenol ethoxylates to be banned in imported clothing and textiles  Government Chemist Environment Agency The European Union’s REACH Chemicals Committee has voted unanimously to implement a ban on imported textiles and clothing containing nonylphenol ethoxylates (NPEs) above a maximum permitted level of 0.01 % m/m. Currently, manufacturers within the EU cannot produce textiles or clothing containing nonylphenol (NP) or NPEs, a ban introduced in 2004 . NPEs are readily washed out of textiles and clothing, particularly during the first few washes. They the easily degrade to NP in the environment. NP is toxic to aquatic life, and has been listed as a priority hazardous substance (PHS) under the EU’s Water Framework Directive (WFD) . The ban on manufacture of textiles and clothing containing NP and NPEs has led to a fall in the levels of NP in water bodies, but it has been estimated by the Environment Agency that up to 20 % of the NP levels found in UK water bodies comes from wash-off from imported textiles and clothing. Analytical measurement of NP and NPEs is usually carried out using high performance liquid chromatography linked to mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS), which can determine these substances accurately down to about 0.002 µg/L, well below the WFD limit. ‘However, there are some concerns that laboratories working with the textile industry have experienced problems measuring NPEs at the proposed maximum levels. The development of a certified reference material (CRM) to aid laboratories in this area would be highly beneficial. Any ban on imports would come into force five years after the date any Regulation is published."
/government/news/first-phase-of-flood-bank-work-on-whittlesey-washes-complete,"The first phase of the Environment Agency's work to improve flood defence banks at Whittlesey Washes has been completed early.  First phase of flood bank work on Whittlesey Washes complete  Environment Agency Work was carried out to strengthen a 5km section of the South Barrier Bank between Ring’s End at Guyhirn and Poplar House Farm, where layers of compacted material have been placed to help prevent erosion of the banks. Whittlesey Washes – also known as the Nene Washes – stores water from the River Nene when it is ‘tide-locked’. This happens when heavy rainfall increases the flows in the river and coincides with high tides, meaning the extra water cannot be released through the Dog in a Doublet Sluice. As the tide recedes, water is released from the reservoir and into the tidal River Nene through the Ring’s End Sluice. Now the work is complete, the footpath running along the crest of the bank has been reopened to the public. Phase one of the project was started in July 2013. It’s part of a three-year, £26m Environment Agency-led scheme to strengthen a 16km stretch of the South Barrier Bank. Guy Szomi, Environment Agency catchment engineer, said: “We’re very pleased to have completed the first phase of the Whittlesey Washes bank works – this swift and efficient work with our partners means local people can get back to enjoying walking in the area while the warmer months are still upon us. “The Whittlesey Washes project will improve the condition of the South Barrier Bank so it can continue to protect hundreds of homes, roads, and railways in and around Peterborough, as well as 8,000 hectares of farmland to the south east of the city.” Phase two of the bank improvements – between Poplar House Farm and Eldernell, and from Eldernell to Bassenhally – started last summer. While this work will be finished by November, the footpath through this patch will remain diverted until next summer. This will allow the grass – which plays an integral part to the stability of the bank – to establish. The third phase, which started in March, will see the 3km stretch of bank between Stanground and Ball Bridge in Whittlesey strengthened. A low, 249m-long concrete wall is being built between Stanground Sluice and the car park. Once this section is complete, we will be able to open the Green Wheel cycle path (route 21) earlier than originally planned. All bank work is expected to be complete by the end of November 2015."

Flood risk management plans (FRMPs): 2015 to 2021  Environment Agency Flood risk management plans explain the risk of flooding from rivers, the sea, surface water, groundwater and reservoirs. FRMPs set out how risk management authorities will work with communities to manage flood risk over the next 6 years. Each EU member country must produce FRMPs as set out in the EU Floods Directive 2007. Each FRMP covers a specific area called a river basin district ( RBD ). Use the map to find your river basin district. Working with river basin management plans ( RBMPs ) and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive RBMPs provide a framework for achieving an improved and sustainable water environment for each RBD . RBMPs and FRMPs provide a joint and integrated approach to catchment planning for water. Working together to achieve the objectives and measures in the plans will help achieve benefits to human health and wellbeing, economic prosperity and the natural environment. See the River basin management plans 2015. There are strong links between RBMPs and the UK’s Marine Strategy which implements the Marine Strategy Framework Directive.

/government/news/parkham-farms-cheese-factory-in-devon-fined-for-pollution,"A dairy farm owner and manager from Devon and their company have been ordered to pay £30,680 in fines and costs for polluting a stream , illegally damming another stream and breaching an environmental permit.     Parkham Farms cheese factory in Devon fined for pollution  Environment Agency The case was brought by the Environment Agency. Peter Willes and Richard Marsden, who run P.W. and R.M. farming partnership and Parkham Farms Limited, pleaded guilty to 3 offences and Marsden asked for another offence of slurry pollution that occurred in March this year at Beckland Farm to be taken into consideration. On 8 January 2014 at Higher Alminstone Farm in Woolsery near Bideford, P.W. and R.M. farming, consisting of Willes and Marsden, spread slurry on a field next to the A39 between Downham Cross and Hobby Lodge. The field is owned by the Clovelly Estate but rented to the farm partnership. It rained heavily and flushed the slurry into the nearby watercourse. The pollution was reported to the Environment Agency who took a sample which confirmed that the slurry had heavily polluted the small stream. The purpose of spreading slurry or slurry contaminated rainwater is to act as a fertiliser. But the court heard that it should not be spread when the ground is waterlogged or when heavy rain is forecast, which may wash it off the field. Farmers are required by law to provide a minimum of 4 months storage capacity to store slurry but the farm’s slurry stores were full. But instead of tankering the slurry away the farm partnership decided to spread it to land. Agency officers witnessed the second offence on 22 April 2014, when they found a dam had been constructed in a stream at Beckland Farm near Hartland and that water was being pumped from the stream to a newly constructed reservoir. The dam was holding back nearly all the water before a member of the public removed some of the sand bags used to form the dam. The third offence related to waste from Parkham Farms cheese factory, being spread onto land in breach of a condition of their environmental permit. Wastes from manufacturing and other industrial processes fall under European waste legislation (European Directive on Waste). The recovery, reuse or disposal of these wastes are controlled by environmental permits. These permits contain conditions, with which the operator of the waste activity must comply. Liz Iles for the Environment Agency said: Slurry and farm washings can kill fish and other aquatic life by adding toxic pollutants and stripping oxygen from the water. It is therefore important farmers make every effort to ensure these farm wastes do not escape into our rivers and streams. Farmers should maximise the use of slurry as fertiliser, ensure that slurry lagoons are empty by the start of winter and also have spare capacity for emergencies. Appearing before Barnstaple magistrates, Peter Willes was fined a total of £4,280, Richard Marsden was fined £3,780 and the Parkham Farms partnership was fined £22,620. Ends"

/guidance/lydney-harbour-information-for-boaters,"The Environment Agency manages Lydney Harbour on the River Severn. Lydney Harbour: Information for boaters Boating Environment Agency Lydney Harbour is next to the River Severn in Gloucestershire. Sale of Lydney Harbour The Environment Agency has instructed national property consultants Lambert Smith Hampton to handle the sales process on their behalf. Navigating Lydney Harbour Approaches to the harbour are shown on British Admiralty chart 1166, position Latitude 51 o 42’.6 North and Longitude 2 o 30’.5 West. The harbour consists of an outer basin, inner basin and a disused canal. There are no suitable anchorages close to the harbour. Water height approaching the harbour The approaches to Lydney are subject to very strong tidal streams and the area outside the harbour dries at low water. Datum relating to Lydney Chart Datum is 1.83m below Ordnance Datum Newlyn. Lydney Sill is 0.13m below Ordnance Datum Newlyn. Tidal Heights in relation to Chart Datum Mean High Water Springs ( MHWS ) 9.3m Mean High Water Neaps ( MHWN ) 5.6m Mean Low Water Springs 0.6m Mean Low Water Neaps 0.5m The depth over the outer basin sill is 7.6 metres at MHWS and 3.9 metres at MHWN . You can work out the depth of water over the sill by deducting 1.2 metres from the depth shown on the gauge at Sharpness Dock .at the head of Bristol Channel. Harbour Procedures The entrance to Lydney Harbour can be difficult to navigate. It’s only available at or within half an hour of high water. The tidal streams run across the entrance with considerable strength. Boats approaching Lydney should switch your radio to VHF channel 37. All boat movements are controlled by the Harbour Master, via VHF radio or mobile phone. Boats may enter Lydney Harbour when a low intensity orange flashing light is displayed at a height of 2.5m from a stand on the North side of the entrance to the outer basin. This light is visible when abeam of the North pier, at a range of half a nautical mile. If you are able to you should also monitor VHF radio channel 13 (Sharpness Radio) to check inter-ship communication and communication with Sharpness Dock to avoid potential collision with commercial boats bound to or from Sharpness Dock. To ensure the safety of navigation of all boats in the River Severn, the main channel must be recognised as a narrow channel in the context of The International Regulations for the Prevention of Collisions at Sea . Rule 9 of these Regulations, about narrow channels, is particularly important for all boats using the River Severn and Lydney Harbour. You should note that large or commercial boats on the river may have restricted navigation and be unable take action to avoid a collision because of the narrow channel and severe tides. Plan your passage into the harbour We recommend you plan your passage to or from Lydney Harbour taking account of the weather, times of high and low water, available depths and hazards. Check Admiralty chart 1166. The harbour master can also give you guidance. Basin and lock dimensions The harbour outer gates have a width of 10.1 metres. The outer basin is 82.3 metres long with an average width of 22.7 metres and depths of 7.3 metres at high water springs. The lock to the inner basin is 7.3 metres wide and has depths of 4.1 metres at the upper gate sill. The inner basin is 231.7 metres long and 32 metres wide. Pilotage Pilotage isn’t compulsory within Lydney Harbour. Pilotage is compulsory in Gloucester Harbour if your boat is 30m or more long. You can get details from the Gloucester Harbour Trustees . Boats entering Lydney Harbour You should approach the dock on a westerly heading from the main channel of the River Severn, from a point north of Bull Rock. Then cross the Sanigar Sands toward the main pier of Lydney Dock. How you approach will depend on the height and location of any off lying sandbanks. The sandbanks vary in level and may be up to 1 metre above the height of Lydney entrance sill. The outer basin at the harbour is used to tow moor inbound boats and pre-position outbound boats as required so full use can be made of the times the tidal allows passage over the sill. Notice of arrival and departure time You should contact the Harbour Master to give notice of when you plan to arrive at or leave the harbour so the harbour gates can be opened. For tides predicted to be 8.4 meters of more at Sharpness you should give 6 hours notice. For tides predicted to be less than 8.4 metres you should give 24 hours notice. The Harbour Master may be contacted: by telephone on 07768 861 282 on VHF channel 37 Find out about call charges . Boats leaving the harbour should be ready to enter the lock 1 hour before high water. The harbour is operational from one and a half hours before high water until high water. Insurance All boats entering Lydney Harbour must have a minimum of third party marine insurance. People using Lydney Harbour do so at their own risk; the Environment Agency accepts no responsibility for any loss or injury. Harbour approach and entry On both flood and ebb of the tide there is a strong flow across the entrance to the harbour, up to about 6 knots. There is slack water between the entrance piers. There is also slack water on the in-coming tide north of Lydney pier extending as far as Fairtide rock. You should plan to arrive off Lydney no earlier than 20 minutes before high water. Take care not to arrive off the entrance too early on tide and ensure that there’s sufficient under keel clearance over Lydney and Saniger sands. We recommended that if you are approaching from the south west you use the main navigational channel until mid way between Bull Rock Beacon and Berkeley Pill. Then steer a course for Lydney Harbour entrance making allowance for tidal influence. If you are approaching from Sharpness head for Lydney north pier making allowance for tidal influence and making use of the slack water mentioned above. During the summer months there may be small yachts on drying moorings in this area. Give a wide berth to the fish trap marked on the chart 2 miles south west of Lydney. At some states of tide it will be just below water level. We recommend that you don’t leave the main channel unless you have local knowledge of the area. Large commercial ships using the nearby docks at Sharpness and the River Severn are confined to the main navigation channel. This is recognised as a narrow channel and skippers of small craft should act prudently and with due regard to the International Rules for the Prevention of Collisions at Sea to avoid hampering the movement of larger boats. Information for small boats travelling between Sharpness and Bristol is available from Gloucester Harbour Trustees . This includes information for boats travelling to Lydney. Information is also in Arrowsmith’s Bristol Channel tide table, available to buy online or from book sellers . Facilities in the harbour A limited number of moorings are installed and maintained by the Environment Agency within the inner basin of the harbour. Mooring charge for boats under 9 metres Monthly charge £22.50 Annual charge £270 Mooring charge for boats 9 metres and over Monthly charge £36 Annual charge £432 The Environment Agency Harbour Master controls all moorings within the harbour area. Allocation is determined though discussion between the Harbour Master and the boat operator. Lydney Yacht Club leases premises and the slipway adjacent to Lydney Harbour. There are occasional dinghy rallies in the harbour."

Help is on the way to navigate the River Wye  Environment Agency The boards have been developed in consultation with a wide range of partners including Natural Resources Wales, Wye Valley Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, Brecon Beacons National Park Authority, Hay Town Council, Herefordshire County Council and Monmouthshire County Council. It is hoped that the bi-lingual boards will be ready for installation by October, and will be installed at access points on the River Wye at Hay-on-Wye, Hereford and Monmouth. Along with local information and guidance for visitors, the boards give out strong messages in relation to caring for wildlife, personal safety, keeping the river healthy and consideration for other river users, visitors and anglers. The Environment Agency has navigational responsibility for the River Wye. This means developing and maintaining sustainable recreation and navigation on the river with the help of the Wye Navigation Advisory Committee, a group whose members represent a wide range of user interests, as well as wildlife and conservation interests. Lynn Bulbeck, from the Environment Agency said: “The boards are providing key information to visitors and many river users along the River Wye. Canoeists will find the boards particularly useful as it highlights areas where they can get in and out of the water easily. With our partner organisations, we have ensured that the boards are both visually pleasing and informative.” Cllr Robert Golesworthy, Mayor of Hay said: “Working in partnership with the Environment Agency we have achieved our goals of improving access to and usage of the waterfront in Hay. Without this help and support it would have been impossible to succeed.” Members of the public are encouraged to visit the area, and when the boards are installed, they can read about and see some of the wildlife that may be around and which make the River Wye unique and of international importance.

Licence-dodging anglers receive hefty fines  Environment Agency Three anglers were this week ordered to pay more than £2,500 in fines and costs after Environment Agency bailiffs caught them fishing without a rod licence. The trio were found guilty in their absence after Taunton magistrates heard how they had been caught illegally fishing at lakes and ponds near Bridgwater, Somerset. The highest fine was imposed on Ashley Graham of Green Lane, Avonmouth, Bristol who was caught at Emerald Pool and ordered to pay £400 for having no rod licence and £400 for providing false details. He was also ordered to pay a victim surcharge of £40, court costs of £150 and Environment Agency costs of £127. Adam Wayne Trott of Collett Road, Norton Fitzwarren, Taunton and Lee Pullin of Wroughton Drive, Bristol also received fines of £400 each after licence-dodging at Trinity Waters and Folly Foot Farm Fishery respectively. They also faced a £40 victim surcharge each, court costs of £150 and Environment Agency costs of £127. Fisheries enforcement officer Richard Dearnley said: There is no excuse not to buy a rod licence. They cost just £27 for a whole year and can easily be obtained from the Post Office or online. If you choose not to buy a licence, not only are you cheating other anglers and the future of the sport but you risk a criminal conviction and a hefty fine. Our enforcement teams will continue to carry out regular rod licence checks and crackdown on licence-dodgers,’ said Mr Dearnley. The cases were heard by Taunton magistrates on August 17.

/government/news/new-tidal-gauge-will-record-data-to-improve-flood-forecasting,"A new tidal gauge installed in The Wash, Lincolnshire, will help the Environment Agency measure tides, predict flooding and assess the impact of climate change more accurately. New tidal gauge will record data to improve flood forecasting  Environment Agency It completes a national network of 44 gauges that record information about sea levels to provide more accurate forecasts. The instrument is on a platform measuring approximately 2 meters across and 11 meters above sea level. It’s located 4km offshore in The Wash close to the port of Sutton Bridge, Lincolnshire. As well as collecting data for the Environment Agency, the gauge’s information on tide levels will also be used by the harbor authority to help boats navigate through The Wash. Meteorological equipment onboard will measure wind speed and direction, and air pressure and temperature, and the Eastern Fisheries and Conservation Association (EFCA) also has equipment on the platform to measure the water’s quality and salinity. Plus, the gauge will be used by the MoD as a static marker of the end of their testing range, where previously they had used floating buoys. Claire Rose, flood and coastal risk management team leader at the Environment Agency, said: “This new gauge has a practical benefit for local communities as the information it gathers on sea levels will help us predict tidal surges and therefore improve our flood warning service. “It’s a nationally important project, too, as it fills in the last gap in the UK’s monitoring network to give us the best picture of tidal conditions across the country. “The gauge will prove invaluable throughout its 60-year lifetime by transmitting other important scientific data to a range of partner organisations.” The £6m project was funded through Defra’s flood defence Grant In Aid scheme and was completed in May."

/government/news/survey-competition-reaps-rewards-on-tees,"Vital information has been captured after a massive 675lbs of fish were caught by anglers in a fishing competition on the River Tees.  Survey competition reaps rewards on Tees  Environment Agency Eighty anglers took part in the Environment Agency’s ‘Survey Match’ on Sunday – which saw competitors record the species, numbers and weights of fish caught. This provides valuable data to the Environment Agency and Tees River Trust to help in the management of the river and inform future fisheries projects for the River Tees. Anglers who returned a survey card were entered into a prize draw to win £100 cash prize as well as fishing equipment. The overall competition was won by Bob Walker who caught 323 fish – mostly dace – for a total weight of 27lb 5oz. Environment Agency Fisheries Technical Specialist Phil Rippon, who took part in the competition and handed out the prizes said: In total 675lbs of fish were caught by anglers on the day, all catches were recorded and the fish returned safely to the river. Interesting captures on the day included a sea trout and over 100 large brown trout. While these were not part of the match they were recorded for survey purposes and immediately returned to the river. I’d like to say a big thanks to local angling clubs who gave up large sections of their water for the day so they could be used for the survey match. As well as everyone enjoying a great day, by working together we were able to capture vital information about the Tees. All of the proceeds from ticket sales - £870 – was donated to the Tees River Trust and will be reinvested in projects directly benefitting angling on the River Tees. Tees River Trust Manager, Ben Lamb, added: The competition had a brilliant turn out and there was a great atmosphere along the river banks. This is a really valuable donation to the Trust and we’d like to use it for something that is going to benefit angling directly, perhaps looking at initiatives to get more junior members involved in angling.” The Environment Agency is encouraging people to #gofishing and buy a rod licence online ."
/government/news/new-boost-for-an-essex-river,"A river is set to be given a new lease of life thanks to Environment Agency and Essex Wildlife Trust restoration projects. New boost for an Essex river  Environment Agency The schemes on the River Blackwater at Bocking have been designed to reduce erosion and flood risk, improve fish habitat and the overall ecology of the river. It also provides recreation opportunities for the local community and angling club. The first project, led by the Environment Agency, began in April 2014, and work was carried out over a 2 week period in March 2015. The latest scheme, taking place further downstream by the Bocking nature reserve and designed by the Essex Wildlife Trust (with Defra funding), started last week and is set to be completed within 3 weeks. The Environment Agency’s Dr Trevor Bond, a geomorphologist who designed the first scheme, said: “The river restoration at Bocking has increased the availability of habitats for all river life. It has also helped reduce local flood risk, enhanced water quality and improved access to the river channel. Overall the scheme has provided multiple benefits for people and wildlife.” The river has been heavily modified in the past to improve land drainage and reduce flood risk, however this created a number of problems, which affected the fish habitat. Among the changes introduced by the projects were; narrowing the river channel, making some sections fast flowing installing woody debris to provide habitat for fish Planting of 70 native trees along the bank edge to provide shade, habitat diversity and a future source of woody debris Mike Neale, Environment Agency’s catchment co-ordinator, said: “As well as improving the habitat for plants and animals, the project has also improved amenity and recreation opportunities to the local community and angling club. We have created a more sustainable channel profile that will need less maintenance in future without increasing flood risk.” Kieren Alexander, biodiversity project officer at Essex Wildlife Trust, said: “The wildlife in the river, including fish and otters, will benefit from a more diverse, richer riverbank and a cleaner healthier stretch of water. This will mean more dragonflies and wildflowers in the summer and better habitat in the winter for fish both locally and throughout the river.” For advice on river management call our National Customer Contact Centre on 03708 506506."
/government/news/prehistoric-fish-return-to-englands-rivers,"A prehistoric fish, that was around 200 million years before dinosaurs, has been seen in English rivers for the first time since the 1800s. Prehistoric fish return to England’s rivers  Environment Agency The world’s oldest living vertebrates, lamprey are snake-like creatures with a circular disc of razor sharp teeth instead of jaws. The largest of the UK lamprey species - the sea lamprey – can grow up to 1 metre in length. Once a common sight in our waterways, river and sea lampreys are now endangered across Europe. The pollution caused by the Industrial Revolution, along with the construction of mill weirs that blocked their migration, had a devastating effect on their numbers. But lampreys are slowly returning to their old habitats, thanks to the lowest levels of pollution for more than 100 years and the Environment Agency’s work to remove some river structures like weirs. Where barriers cannot be removed a range of innovative techniques are being trialled, including the fitting of lamprey ‘tiles’, to help them navigate back to their old spawning grounds. Lamprey tiles are low-cost, low-maintenance tiles with broad cones that enable lamprey to squirm upwards using their sucker-like mouths to anchor themselves. On Buttercrambe Weir on the River Derwent in Yorkshire initial results have been encouraging, and it is hoped that lamprey tiles could help in many more rivers. Environment Agency fisheries expert Simon Toms said: “For the last 200 hundred years, some rivers have not been capable of supporting lamprey species as a result of water quality, poor habitat and manmade barriers. “Now that water quality has improved and some of these barriers have been removed we are seeing lampreys return to the upper reaches of rivers such as the Ouse, Trent, and Derwent, where they were absent as recently as 30 years ago. “These are fascinating fish, living fossils, that have a special place in the history and traditions of this country, and we hope that with a helping hand from us they will be able to thrive in England’s rivers once again.” Lampreys have been regarded as a luxury food throughout history – they are recorded as being eaten by the Vikings, poached in red wine by the Romans and eaten in lamprey pie by the British monarch on special occasions. King John is said to have fined the City of Gloucester the equivalent of £250,000 for not delivering his Christmas lamprey pie and Queen Elizabeth II was sent a lamprey pie from Gloucester for her diamond jubilee in 2012, though the fish were imported from the Great Lakes in North America. Lamprey pie also features in the TV series Game of Thrones. In ‘The Prince of Winterfell’ Tyrion Lannister dines on lamprey pie whilst talking over plans for the Battle of the Blackwater with his sister Queen Cersei. As well as being a fascinating ancient species, lampreys are ecologically important in helping to process nutrients in rivers as well as a food source for fish and birds, such as herons and sawbill ducks. There are 3 lamprey species found in rivers in England. The brook lamprey, which, as an adult, measures around 15 centimetres, completes its life cycle wholly in freshwater. Like many freshwater fish species, they require clean flowing water in which to spawn and migrate upstream to find suitable spawning habitats. However, its much larger cousins, river and sea lampreys, migrate to sea where they mature as adults before returning to the river to spawn."
/government/news/water-company-fails-to-act-fast-enough-on-major-sewage-spill,"South West Water have been fined £28,000 and ordered to pay prosecution costs of £3,935 after failing to respond speedily enough to a sewage spill caused by a  blockage at the Milford Park pumping station, Teignmouth, Devon. Water company fails to act fast enough on major sewage spill  Environment Agency The case was brought by the Environment Agency. On 27June 2013, the pumping station at Milford Park became partially blocked when a penstock valve broke and fell into the 30 per cent shut position. Sewage accumulated in the pumping station and in the surrounding sewers until it spilled from 3 locations – the rugby club combined sewage outflow which leads into the Bitton Brook for 18 hours, from Milford Park into the Teign Estuary for 16 hours and also a manhole adjacent to the rugby club. Starting at 8.50pm, alarms and signals were transmitted from Milford Park pumping station to South West Water’s control centre, warning of the problems . The court heard that there had been an hour and a half delay on South West Water’s part in responding to the alarms. Richard Fisher for the Environment Agency said: South West Water had already recorded the site as at risk after a large rag ball had been trapped in the pumping station. The company had arranged for the rag ball to be removed on 4 July. This made the problems experienced on 27 June worse but did not cause them. The sewage spill affected the nearby beaches at Teignmouth with 2 bathing water beaches failing the water quality testing standards on the day. The court heard that South West Water had improved the works at the Milford Park pmping station."

/government/news/advice-on-the-use-of-metaldehyde,"The Environment Agency is calling on growers to think ‘soil, slope and stream’ when they apply metaldehyde-based slug pellets to crops.  Advice on the use of metaldehyde  Environment Agency It is important growers adhere to the current guidelines on metaldehyde use to avoid contaminating watercourses and protect drinking water supplies. Metaldehyde is the pesticide that most often causes risks to drinking water sources, especially in the autumn. Farmers need to operate ‘best practice’ to avoid pollution. If metaldehyde enters watercourses it can threaten drinking water quality. This can result in disruption of water abstraction to treatment works and reservoirs. Good practice from farmers is required to prevent metaldehyde entering watercourses. This includes taking into consideration: the slope of the field - steeper fields are a higher risk the drainage status of the field - heavy soils and under-draining are a high risk the proximity of watercourses or ditches - fields adjacent to these are high risk the current and predicted weather - saturated soils and heavy rain can cause a high risk of runoff the filling and wash down area of the pellet applicator - areas which run off to drains or watercourses will have a high risk of pollution Visit WIYBY and enter the relevant postcode to find out if there is a metaldehyde risk in your area. Metaldehyde Stewardship Group guidelines promote autumn restrictions to prevent the pesticide from causing water pollution. The restriction period runs from 1 August to 31 December. These recommend a maximum total application rate of 210g/ha of the active ingredient, which may be reduced to 160g/ha or less upon the recommendation of a BASIS qualified advisor. The maximum application rate of 700g/ha/calendar year is now a statutory legal requirement, plus a 6 metre no-spread zone adjacent to watercourses. Alternatives, such as ferric phosphate, are available and should be considered in high risk areas, particularly if you are approaching the metaldehyde limit."
/government/news/runaway-business-operated-illegally-for-more-money,"A legally permitted vehicle breakers yard over-spilled onto unpermitted land at a disused Norfolk airfield leading to fines in court today. Run(a)way business operated illegally for more money  Environment Agency V J Commercials Ltd was fined £24,000 for each of 2 offences to run concurrently and ordered to pay £13,000 towards costs. Ohanis John Manoukian, a director of the company, was given a 12 months community order to undertake 180 hours of unpaid work on each of 2 offences to run concurrently, fined £12,000 on each offence to run concurrently and ordered to pay £4,000 towards prosecution costs. V J Commercials operates out of a unit at Shipdham Airfield which is permitted by the Environment Agency. Mr Mark Watson, prosecuting for the Environment Agency, told Norwich Crown Court that when the company ran out of space at its permitted site it began to store waste on the runway at the airfield. There was no permit in place authorising this storage. He said the company had avoided the costs of operating legitimately in order to maximize profits. Ohanis John Manoukian (John) is a director of the company. “The company were aware that they were operating illegally and continued to do so for at least 12 months despite advice and guidance from the Environment Agency,” said Mr Watson. Her Honour Judge Moore heard that the company used 3 sites at the airfield but was permitted for only 1. John Manoukian was the site’s Technically Competent Manager yet when Environment Agency officers visited the airfield they saw scrap vehicles on the runway, numerous oil spills on the ground and vehicles leaking oil. Another unit at the airfield was also being used to illegally store waste prior to its disposal. Despite numerous visits, advice and letters to stop activities, the business continued illegally. Mr Watson told the court that V J Commercials had already been given advice and guidance in 2006 and 2011 about storing waste vehicles on land without an environmental permit. John Manoukian told investigators that if he had cleared the runway site he would not have been able to continue with the business. When sentencing the company and Mr Manoukian, Judge Moore said: In my view it is no coincident that the amount of waste on the site increased as the price of scrap metal fell and the overseas market was left available. This was a calculated commercial decision. A significant aggravating feature is the willful and persistent refusal to heed advice, guidance, warning and statutory notice. I unhesitatingly take the view that the breach was deliberate and for financial gain. In mitigation she gave the defendants credit for guilty pleas and took into account there had been remediation and that the site is now lawfully operated under a permit. After the hearing Environment Officer Jack Colman said: The Environment Agency is committed to supporting legitimate waste businesses by taking enforcement action against those who operate illegally. We tried to help the company comply with the law but our advice was ignored.” VJ Commercials Ltd: Between 26 August 2013 and 13 August 2014 on land known as the Runway, Shipdham Airfield Industrial Estate, Shipdham, Norfolk you did operate a regulated facility, namely a waste operation for the deposit, storage and treatment of waste, without being authorised by an environmental permit granted under Regulation 13 of the Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2010 Contrary to Regulation 12(1)(a) and 38(1)(a) Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2010 On or about 13 August 2014 on land known as Unit 4, Shipdham Airfield Industrial Estate, Shipdham, Norfolk you did operate a regulated facility, namely a waste operation for the deposit and storage of waste, without being authorised by an environmental permit granted under Regulation 13 of the Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2010 Contrary to Regulation 12(1)(a) and 38(1)(a) Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2010 Ohanis John Manoukian Between 26 August 2013 and 13 August 2014 on land known as the Runway, Shipdham Airfield Industrial Estate, Shipdham, Norfolk, V J Commercials Ltd, with your consent, connivance or attributable to neglect on your part as a director of V J Commercials Ltd, did operate a regulated facility, namely a waste operation for the deposit, storage and treatment of waste, without being authorised by an environmental permit granted under Regulation 13 of the Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2010.

HiPP UK Ltd agree to pay charities after recycling blunder  Environment Agency Organic baby food company HiPP UK Ltd, based in Reading, has paid almost £415,000 to 3 environmental charities to compensate for not meeting their obligations under the Producer Responsibility (Packaging Waste) Regulations 1997- 2007. This is the largest-value enforcement undertaking ever accepted by the Environment Agency. The Environment Agency found that the company had failed to register as a producer of packaging, and failed to meet its requirements to recover and recycle packaging waste between 2004 and 2011. When HiPP UK Ltd were confronted with the environmental offences, they offered an enforcement undertaking of payment to 3 environmental charities of £414,960 plus payment of the Environment Agency’s costs, registered the company as a packaging producer and put in place provision to ensure that non-compliance does not happen again – all of which were accepted by the Environment Agency. Heather White, Environment Officer said: In any enforcement undertaking, the person or company should offer to restore or remediate the harm caused by the incident where that is possible. For producer responsibility offences this is done by making a financial contribution to a recognised environmental charity or project to achieve environmental benefit. The offender must also demonstrate they will change their behaviour and ensure future compliance with environmental legislation. HiPP UK Ltd offered to pay by 3 equal annual instalments (£138,320 per annum): £75,000 to the Bumblebee Conservation Trust £189,960 to the Woodland Trust £150,000 to the Yorkshire Dales Millennium Trust Along with prosecutions, the Environment Agency use other sanctions including enforcement notices, stop notices and civil sanctions to either improve performance or stop sites from operating. It is making more use of the wide range of measures that are available to bring sites back into compliance as quickly as possible. Heather added: Civil sanctions such as these are a proportionate and cost-effective way for businesses to make amends for less serious environmental offences. Failure to comply with the enforcement undertaking may result in the person or company being prosecuted for the original offence/s."

/government/news/appeal-for-information-following-illegal-fishing-in-london,"The Environment Agency is appealing for information following a serious illegal fishing offence at Teddington Weir in Richmond. Appeal for information following illegal fishing in London  Environment Agency Acting on a tip off from a local angler, Environment Agency Fisheries Enforcement Officers responded to a report of illegal netting at Teddington weir pool on Thursday 22 October, where a 50 metre long gill net had been set in the tidal Thames containing over 100 large adult fish totalling several hundred pounds in weight. The angler who discovered the net managed to release most of the fish alive and remove it from the water, however a number of fish were killed. Gill nets are size selective and trap fish by entangling their gills in mesh, so mainly larger specimen fish were caught. Environment Agency officers met with the angler to retrieve the net and dead fish as evidence. Today they will be carrying out a boat patrol to ensure no further illegal traps or nets are present. They will also look to increase fisheries enforcement patrols in the weir-pool and surrounding area to deter any repeat of this highly damaging and illegal activity. It is very likely that the gill net was deployed from a boat and the way it was buoyed and set meant that those responsible are very likely to have known that this was an illegal act. This activity is an offence under the Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries Act 1975 and if convicted, offenders can face up to a £50,000 fine.

/government/news/boaters-caught-without-navigation-licences,"Eight boaters have been prosecuted for keeping their vessels on waterways without registering them with the Environment Agency. Boaters caught without navigation licences  Environment Agency Five charges were heard at Peterborough Magistrates’ Court on 7 October 2015, 1 at Scunthorpe Magistrates’ Court on 14 October 2015 and 2 at King’s Lynn Magistrates’ Court on 21 October 2015. The offenders were ordered to pay fines totaling £3,270 and costs totaling £1,900. On all 6 occasions, the Environment Agency’s river inspectors saw the vessels moored up without displaying the necessary license. Registration discs must be displayed on craft so they are clearly visible to the organisation’s enforcement staff. Nathan Arnold, an Environment Agency Waterways Manager, said: “Failing to register a vessel just does not pay. “Not only do people risk being prosecuted and fined up to £1,000, but they still have to pay their registration fee and could end up with a criminal record.” All vessels kept, used or let for hire on Environment Agency waterways must be registered. As part of the registration process the vessel owner must have the appropriate safety certificates and valid insurance. If a vessel is not registered the Environment Agency cannot be sure it is safe; therefore these vessels could be a potential hazard to other waterway users. They may also be a pollution risk and have negative impacts on wildlife. Vessel registration charges are needed for maintaining the 568 kilometres of Anglian Waterway rivers, lock sites and other navigation facilities. The Environment Agency routinely inspects locks, moorings and other structures to make sure they are in good condition. Larger projects such as lock refurbishments are also carried out normally during the winter months. John Cowell from Blackhorse Drove, Littleport, Ely, Cambridgeshire, had avoided a registration fee of £78.98 for his vessel ‘Wot’ Appened’ which was found moored on the River Great Ouse, at Black Horse Drove, Littleport, Cambridgeshire on 21 May 2015. Cowell pleaded guilty by post and was fined £60, ordered to pay costs of £150, court charge of £150 and victim surcharge of £20. Julie MacFarlane from c/o Upware Marina, Old School Lane, Upware, Ely, Cambridgeshire had avoided the registration fee of £878.71 for her vessel ‘MacFarlans Lantern’ which was found moored on the River Old West at Lazy Otter, Cambridgeshire on 14 May 2015.

/government/news/nature-reserve-angler-fined,"An angler, caught in the act of fishing illegally at a Cambridgeshire nature reserve, has been fined.  Nature reserve angler fined  Environment Agency The angler from Cornwall was thwarted by the combined investigations of the Environment Agency and Cambridgeshire Police. Bait containers, bonfires and evidence of fishing had previously been spotted by wardens of Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Northamptonshire Wildlife Trust at Godmanchester Nature Reserve, an area of outstanding natural beauty. Environment Agency Fisheries Enforcement Officers later discovered angler Philip Rule, aged 50, asleep under a shelter carved deep into a hedgerow near the water’s edge. He had two baited rods cast into the water, set up with bite alarms, commonly used by specimen anglers across the UK. The case was past to Cambridgeshire Police for prosecution. The nature reserve which is protected under various wildlife and countryside orders includes some large lakes, none of which are allowed to be used for angling or any other water sport. Intelligence suggested that the largest lake was regularly being fished illegally. Cambridgeshire Magistrates Court was informed by Cambridgeshire Police who brought the prosecution against Rule, that he was not only fishing illegally he also did not have a valid rod licence. He admitted knowing that he should not have been there but chose to take the chance and fish it regardless. Rule who was caught on 26 April 2015 was charged under Schedule 1 Theft Act offence (Fishing without permission-Taking or destroying Fish) and for fishing without a valid rod licence (Section 27 of the Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries Act 1975). He was fined £170, ordered to pay £20 victim surcharge, costs of £85 prosecution costs, a criminal courts charge of £150. After the hearing, Environment Agency investigator Rob Boothby said: This is the first time that such an offence has been successfully prosecuted in Cambridgeshire and Bedfordshire and was brought about by working together with other organisations. This will no doubt send a strong signal to not only those anglers who choose not to buy a rod licence, but also to those who may be tempted to fish in areas that are out of bounds. This result is indicative of the punishment they can expect when they are caught."

Your chance to discover more about the secret life of trout  Environment Agency The Environment Agency has joined forces with the Wild Trout Trust and Northumberland Rivers Trust to host the event in Northumberland later this month. It will take place on Saturday 14 November, meeting at 10am at Humford Steppingstones, Church Lane, Bedlington. It will end at 1pm. The workshop will include a river walk along the River Blyth, where issues currently affecting the river will be discussed, before the teams demonstrate simple techniques that can help improve habitat quality on local rivers. The Environment Agency’s Fisheries Technical Officer Robbie Stevenson will be there on the day. He said: The workshop is open to everyone with an interest in rivers and wildlife, and who wants to find out more about what happens below the surface. It’s ideal for anyone wanting to learn more about habitat management for fish and other wildlife, or those who enjoy spending time by their local rivers and would like to understand a little more about them. It will also cover considerations that should be made and the permissions that might be needed before carrying out any work, and therefore will be helpful for angling clubs and riparian owners. And there’s an opportunity for people or organisations to ask questions and discuss any issues about their local river. Anyone interested in attending the workshop is asked to contact The Wild Trout Trust or call the Environment Agency on 0191 203 4266."

/government/news/specially-adapted-boat-for-disabled-anglers-is-a-success,"With the winter fishing season upon us, disabled anglers are encouraged to take advantage of a specially designed boat on the Norfolk Broads. Specially adapted boat for disabled anglers is a success  Environment Agency The wheelie boat, based on the river Yare, was launched in 2011, thanks to a partnership between the Environment Agency and the Norwich and District Pike Club. The boat’s roll-on, roll-off bow ramp and level deck, means wheelchair users can enjoy independent access to angling on the water, and the facility has proved to be popular, with an average of 50 trips a year. Angling access for all is one of the Environment Agency’s highest priorities, and in conjunction with the Broads Angling Strategy Group (BASG), they have already created disabled angling places on many stretches of the tidal rivers. Fisheries specialist at the Environment Agency Steve Lane, said: “We are really proud to be supporting this project. It is a great illustration of how we can work together with anglers and use rod licence money to give people the opportunity to enjoy fishing and the aquatic environment.” Among the people who have benefited from the facility is Iraq veteran Chris Baker, whose serious injuries sustained during action, means he now has to use a wheelchair. Mr Baker, who is involved with Heroes On the Water, contacted the Essex Region Pike Anglers Club to see if there was a chance he could go out pike fishing. The club put him in touch with the Norwich and District Pike Club, who help run the wheelie boat project, and Mr Baker enjoyed a 5-hour trip on the Norfolk Broads. Sean Ellis, regional organiser of the Essex Region Pike Anglers, who accompanied him on the trip, said: “The excitement on Chris’ face was a joy, to feel the freedom of being out in the boat on the Broads. “Try as we did, no pike came to the boat that day, but it mattered little. It was great to think that we’d helped him gain that independence once more.” Members of the Norwich and District Pike Club donate their time, tackle and bait to take out people who would not normally have the opportunity to fish the Broads from a boat. During the fishing close season the boat is used for other trips, including bird watching and general interest in the waterways. John Currie, from the Norwich and District Pike Club, who co-ordinates the project on a voluntary basis, said: “It is very easy to access and those who come on board do not need an escort, which is appealing to many people.” The boat is run from dawn til dust and is taken out in all weathers. Anyone who is interested in booking a trip in the boat should contact John Currie on 07776 221959."
/government/news/suffolk-slurry-pollution-leads-to-fine,"Slurry from a lagoon on a Suffolk farm polluted the River Yox in Suffolk for 10 kilometres.   Suffolk slurry pollution leads to fine  Environment Agency The Environment Agency told Ipswich Magistrates’ Court yesterday (24 Nov) that the owners of the farm, Great Lodge Farm Ltd, had been negligent. The company from Framlingham was fined £6,000 and ordered to pay £4,474 costs after pleading guilty to breaching environmental permitting regulations. In December 2014 staff from the Environment Agency saw the river running dark brown and there was a slurry smell. They traced it to Bowling Green Farm at Sibton where slurry was being pumped from a storage lagoon into a ditch. Pig muck was to be brought to the farm from another farm and was to be stored on a muck pad that drained to the slurry lagoon. Ms Wendy Foster, prosecuting for the Agency, said that ammonia levels were elevated for 10 kilometres of the river. She told the court that the checks carried out by the company, prior to ordering the discharge were insufficient. Staff at the farm blocked the culvert with soil from the farm at the suggestion of Agency staff, the court heard, but by that time the river was already polluted. A director of Great Lodge Farms Martin Kelleway told investigators that staff had not been able to spread the slurry because the fields were too wet so it had to be stored. The lagoon was full of what he thought was just rainwater so discharged it into the ditch to free up space for the muck pad being used. Ms Foster told magistrates that slurry in the lagoon was grossly polluting and once discharged raised ammonia levels, in one tributary of the river, to 25.4mg/l. Typically, clean river water has ammonia levels of less than 1mg/l. After the hearing Environment Agency officer Ben Marshall said: “Because slurry is potentially so polluting extra care needs to be taken in its storage and management. “The staff at this company failed their duty of care and this freshwater was grossly polluted. We hope that other similar operators will learn from this company’s error.” The magistrates took into account that the company had no previous convictions, took immediate steps to mitigate the damage, had shown remorse and had not made or intended to make any financial gain. The company pleaded guilty to: On or about 9 December 2014 you did cause poisonous, noxious or polluting matter, namely trade effluent, to enter inland freshwaters, namely the River Yox, at Sibton, Suffolk without being authorised by an environmental permit Contrary to regulations 12(1)(b) and 38(1)(a) of the Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2010"
/government/news/licence-dodging-angler-pays-high-price-for-a-days-fishing,"Fisherman Peter Farquharson’s attempt to bluff his way out of trouble cost him dearly.  Licence dodging angler pays high price for a day’s fishing  Environment Agency The angler was caught without a valid rod licence at Northam Farm fishing lake near Burnham-on-Sea, Somerset on 25 May 2015. Despite his fishing tackle being clearly visible at the water’s edge and having bought a day permit to fish, Mr Farquharson told Environment Agency bailiffs he had no intention of fishing. The angler’s attempt to ‘get off the hook’ seriously backfired when his case went before a district judge at Taunton magistrates court. He was ordered to pay a total of £1,360 in fines and costs after the judge came to the ‘irresistible conclusion’ he was guilty. Farquharson, from Newport, South Wales, had earlier pleaded not guilty to fishing without a licence. He failed to appear in court on Wednesday (25 November 2015) and was found guilty in his absence. Farquharson was fined £400 plus £400 costs. He was also ordered to pay £520 court costs and a £40 victim surcharge. The severity of the sentence reflects his not guilty plea."

The rescue was a dramatic example of the work our staff do to help communities impacted by flooding. Glyn and Dan spent the rest of their time in Cumbria pumping flood water away from the Circus roundabout in Carlisle, a critical part of the local traffic system. The site and nearby council office was clear of water by last Wednesday evening (9 December) enabling the pair (who are based at our Bradney Depot near Bridgwater in Somerset) to return home the following day. Notes to editors Picture caption: Environment Agency workers Dan Langdon, left, and Glyn Bowey. The Environment Agency sent more than 140 staff, 16 pumps and over 1km of temporary flood barriers to help flood-hit communities in Cumbria. Sir James Bevan, the new chief executive of the Environment Agency, will be visiting our Bradney Depot on Thursday 17 December 2015 . We hope to arrange a photo of him meeting Dan and Glyn during his visit."

/government/news/man-ordered-to-pay-over-16800-for-waste-offences-in-ludlow-shropshire,"Stephen Weaver was sentenced for an offence relating to the storage, deposit and treatment of mixed waste at a site without an environmental permit. Man ordered to pay over £16,800 for waste offences in Ludlow, Shropshire  Environment Agency On the 28 January 2016, Shrewsbury Magistrates Court fined the defendant £1,320, ordered him to pay £10,652 in compensation to the Environment Agency, £4,805.63 in costs, along with a £120 victim surcharge. The charge was brought by the Environment Agency contrary to Regulations 12 (1) and 38 of the Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2010. On 9 September 2014 an officer visited the site on Station Road, Woofferton, Ludlow and observed large mounds of mixed waste including plastic, construction and demolition waste. Mr Weaver was made aware at this time that an environmental permit was required to continue collecting, storing or treating waste on this site. Mr Weaver was advised of the appropriate permits/exemptions that he required. On the 20 February 2015 officers visited the site again and noted newly deposited mixed waste and evidence of waste treatment activities. Environment Agency officers made a further visit on 11 March 2015 where further evidence of the treatment of waste on site was found. On the 26 May 2015 Mr Weaver had still not applied for the appropriate permit for the work which was being carried out on this site. Since the start of these court proceedings in October 2015, Mr Weaver has applied for a waste permit for site. Speaking after the case, an Environment Agency officer in charge of the investigation said: “Mr Weaver was fully aware of his obligations to comply with the environmental permitting rules but chose to ignore them. We take waste crime extremely seriously and will not hesitate to prosecute in cases such as this. In passing the magistrates commentated that they felt Mr Weaver had deliberately continued treating waste despite being advised that he required an environmental permit in order to do so lawfully.“ In mitigation, the court heard that the defendant made partial admissions during interview."

Old Bedford River is 30km long and forms part of the Ouse Washes system, an important storage reservoir for flood waters from the Great Ouse river catchment. The Environment Agency maintains the Ouse Washes system yearly, which typically includes grass cutting, in-channel weed control, vegetation management, desilting and maintenance of structures. This year, along with other maintenance activities, the Environment Agency is undertaking the desilting work near Downham Market. It is particularly important in the Old Bedford River to improve the channel gradient to ensure the river can flow as effectively as possible through the Old Bedford Sluice into the tidal Great Ouse River. John Faulkner of the Environment Agency said: “The desilting works are progressing well on the Old Bedford River. We have already completed around 800m of the 3km and are expecting to complete the rest by mid March at a total cost of £80k.” The work is being undertaken in an environmentally sensitive manner to ensure the important habitat along the river’s edge remains undisturbed."

/government/news/minsterley-man-pleads-guilty-to-slurry-pollution,"Phillip Manning pleaded guilty at Shrewsbury Magistrates’ Court to 1 charge relating to a slurry discharge into a tributary of the Rea Brook. Minsterley man pleads guilty to slurry pollution  Environment Agency On Thursday 25 February, Mr Manning was fined £725, ordered to pay £5,677.80 in prosecution costs, along with a £72.50 victim surcharge. The charge was brought by the Environment Agency, contrary to Regulation 38(1)(a) and 12(1)(b) of the Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2010. On the 21 January 2015, the Environment Agency received a report of slurry running off a field at Bank Farm and covering the nearby road. Officers attended the site and when they arrived they noticed slurry running into the road drains which flowed into the nearby stream. During their investigation officers found that slurry had been spread on a steeply sloping field which was not appropriate for slurry applications when conditions were likely to be wet, frozen or snow covered, which they were at the time. Mr Manning took action to reduce the flow of slurry off the field and clean up the road. Officers revisited the site the next day and found that the slurry was no longer flowing onto the road or entering the brook, but there was a brown foam and scum on the surface, downstream of the surface water discharge pipe. Mr Manning attended an interview under caution on 20 March 2015 and confirmed he is responsible for the day-to-day running of Bank Farm. He stated that on the 19 January 2015, 3000 gallons of slurry was spread on the field in question and 21,000 gallons of slurry on the same field the following day. The Environment Agency had previously given him advice on safe spreading of slurry. Speaking after the case, an Environment Agency officer in charge of the investigation said: “Mr Manning has fully cooperated with the investigation and took prompt actions to stop the pollution. Farm slurry can be very polluting to rivers and it is important that all farmers take care to ensure that they can spread without causing pollution. Slurry is a valuable source of fertiliser on the farm and we encourage good nutrient management planning to help farmers get the best from this resource.” In mitigation on behalf of his client, Mr Manning’s solicitor stated that Mr Manning had assessed the field and based his decision to spread slurry on the field on that. He did not appreciate the potential problems the snow forecast presented. He took over running the farm from his late father and is a young man who works long hours from 4/5am to 9pm, 7 days a week. He assisted with the cleanup operation and has no previous convictions."
/government/news/environment-agency-releases-67000-fish-in-yorkshire-rivers,"Barbel, chub, common bream, dace, grayling and roach populations boosted Environment Agency releases 67,000 fish in Yorkshire rivers  Environment Agency Yorkshire rivers have benefited from a record-breaking year at the Environment Agency’s fish farm. Experts stocked more than 67,000 fish across Yorkshire into rivers and small still waters, including: the River Dearne, River Rother, Walton Nature reserve, the River Wharfe and Driffield West Beck. Fish introduced into rivers, included: barbel, chub, common bream, dace, grayling and roach. Crucian carp were released into still waters at Walton Nature Reserve Fishery. Last year, 2015, was the best year ever for the Environment Agency’s specialist fish breeding farm, resulting in record-breaking numbers of coarse fish being released into England’s rivers in 2015. In total right across the country, the Environment Agency stocked more than 452,220 fish and 1.3 million larvae into rivers. They were all bred at Calverton fish farm, in Nottingham, the Environment Agency’s principal supply of coarse fish for restocking. Every year for the last 31 years the farm has produced up to 450,000 fish of nine species for restocking into rivers following pollution incidents or to help restore fish stocks in rivers where numbers are low. All of its work is funded by rod licence income. Dr Jerome Masters, Fisheries Officer for South and West Yorkshire, said: Rivers across Yorkshire have improved significantly over the past 30 years, and concerted restocking using fish bred at Calverton has accelerated the restoration of natural fish stocks and viable fisheries. We’ve stocked tens of thousands of fish from Calverton right across Yorkshire rivers and stillwaters over the past year, but we’re not complacent. We’ll continue to target our restocking to ensure the continued restoration and ongoing health of our rivers. Calverton fish farm team leader Alan Henshaw added: Growth and production rates of fish that have been grown on the farm for 18 months have been the highest recorded at Calverton. Many rivers and lakes throughout England have benefited from these stockings and the quality of the fish is a testament to the hard work and professionalism of the staff."

Climate change and eutrophication risk in English rivers  Environment Agency This project investigated how climate change might affect eutrophication risk in rivers across England. Reductions in river flow because of climate change could directly affect the concentration of nutrients and the risk of eutrophication. Phosphorus is considered the primary driver of eutrophication and this study looked at how future changes in river flow may alter the dilution of phosphorus as a first step to understanding wider eutrophication risk. Changes in phosphorus concentrations during the summer and low flow periods were shown to have greater rates of increase than annual averages. The work has resulted in a national scale picture of flow related changes in phosphorus concentrations and indicates where we might need to target intervention to meet phosphorus standards in the future.

/government/news/lincolnshire-firm-to-pay-24300-for-polluting-local-watercourse,"A Skellingthorpe business has been fined £15,300 and ordered to pay more than £9,000 in costs for polluting 3.5km of local watercourse.  Lincolnshire firm to pay £24,300 for polluting local watercourse  Environment Agency A Hughes and Son (Skellingthorpe) Ltd, Jerusalem Farm, Skellingthorpe, pleaded guilty to a breach of Environmental Permitting Regulations for allowing effluent to flow into a tributary of the Skellingthorpe Catchwater Drain, resulting in extremely high levels of ammonia in the water. Lincoln Magistrates’ Court heard the company, which runs a rendering plant on-site to process animal by-products into protein meal, had been negligent and failed to take reasonable care to prevent the pollution from occurring. The court was told by Megan Huff, prosecuting for the Environment Agency, that the company’s monitoring processes were insufficient, and the sampling they had carried out of the tributary was inadequate as it failed to identify significantly high levels of ammonia in the watercourse. The case was brought by the Environment Agency following a report of suspected pollution in September 2013. An Environment Officer attended and observed a light-coloured bubbling and frothing discharge entering the watercourse. Investigations found that the discharge was seeping through the bank of the watercourse from the company’s site. Ms Huff told magistrates the levels of ammonia recorded in the watercourse were grossly polluting at 207mg/l and toxic levels of 39.8mg/l were also recorded approximately 3.5km downstream. Typically, clean river water has ammonia levels of less than 1mg/l. Additionally, the company’s water monitoring plans provided no details as to how or where the waste water lagoon or tributary was to be checked. The drainage plan did not include the lagoons or any drainage in relation to moving the effluent to and from the lagoons. The company cooperated with the investigation and has increased monitoring of the tributary. There have not been any further pollution incidents reported. After the hearing, Environment Officer Alice Calton said: “We are satisfied with the outcome and pleased that the courts have taken this matter seriously. “We hope that this prosecution will send a clear message to other companies and operators that poor practice is unacceptable and they must have suitable site management to prevent pollution incidents. “High levels of ammonia can have a detrimental effect on fish and other aquatic life, affecting their food, breeding, or even poisoning them. Pollution like this can have devastating effects on the watercourse and it is essential that all care is taken to prevent this type of incident. “We’d also encourage anyone who spots a potential pollution issue to report it to us by calling 0800 80 70 60 so we can investigate and take the necessary action.” The company pleaded guilty to, between 4 and 19 September 2013, causing a poisonous, noxious or polluting matter to enter inland freshwaters, namely a tributary of the Skellingthorpe Catchwater Drain at Jerusalem Farm at Skellingthorpe, Lincolnshire, without being authorised by an environmental permit, contrary to regulations 12(1)(b) and 38(1)(a) of the Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2010.

/government/news/waste-site-owners-ordered-to-clear-site-within-18-months,"The 2 former owners of a waste transfer business in St Dennis, Cornwall, have been ordered to clear the site within 18 months after admitting a series of permit breaches.   Waste site owners ordered to clear site within 18 months  Environment Agency David and Donna Shrigley were the directors of DRS Demolition National Ltd at Domellick Manor, St Dennis, St Austell, before it went into liquidation. David Shrigley was also ordered to pay a total of £6,052 in fines and costs, and Donna Shrigley £4,234 after pleading guilty to 3 offences. The case was brought by the Environment Agency. Bodmin Magistrates heard the quantity of waste still at the site presented a considerable fire and pollution risk. The waste site, described as an ‘eyesore’, is near both a Site of Special Scientific Interest and a Special Area of Conservation at the Goss and Tregoss moors and is owned personally by Mr and Mrs Shrigley. Magistrates decided that David Shrigley, formally of Carthew Farm, St Dennis, had been reckless in his offending and Donna Shrigley, of Green Lane, Morpeth, Northumberland, negligent. It was admitted that between 29 April 2014 and 11 May 2015, they breached an environmental permit by depolluting vehicles, illegally storing and handling waste, including plasterboard, wood, green waste and trommel fines. They also admitted failing to comply with an enforcement notice on 22 April 2015, which required the reduction of waste on the site by 500 tonnes, and on 11 December 2015, knowingly permitting the carrying on of a waste operation without the benefit of an environmental permit. A spokesman for the Environment Agency said: The company had been continuing to accept waste onto the site which generated income, but failed to process and transfer it off site which reduced expenditure, undermined legitimate business and posed a risk to the environment. The company went into liquidation and the site remains uncleared. Following permit breaches in April and August 2014, the company had agreed to submit to a voluntary improvement plan. But it failed to comply with this, as well as an enforcement notice to reduce the waste destined for landfill, and by April 2015 the quantity had increased. They also failed to comply with a further notice to remove all waste by 9 December 2015. The magistrates issued a Regulation 44 order which orders the former owners to clear the site within 18 months. Failure to comply with this notice is contempt of court. Ends"
/government/news/steaming-waste-and-fly-infestations-lead-to-370000-bill,"Donald Ward Limited was fined £270,000 plus costs for serious and persistent breaches of environmental permits at 2 sites in Derbyshire Steaming waste and fly infestations lead to £370,000 bill  Environment Agency On 21 April 2016, Donald Ward Limited, trading as Ward Recycling, was sentenced at Derby Crown Court for breaches of the Environmental Permitting (England & Wales) Regulations. They pleaded guilty to 3 offences at an earlier court hearing. Donald Ward Limited was fined £270,000 for serious and persistent breaches of its environmental permits at two sites in Derbyshire; Griffon Road and Hallam Fields, and for illegally operating at Old Stanton Ironworks in Derbyshire. In addition, prosecution costs of £100,000 were ordered, bringing the total fines and costs to £370,000. The fines included costs avoided by the company of £40,000. Between March 2012 and June 2013 the company failed to operate its permitted sites at Griffon Road and Hallam Fields properly in that they failed to adequately control the amount of waste on site. Waste brought onto the Griffon Road site was stored for longer than permitted and was seen to be engulfing the outside storage bays. The odorous nature of some waste resulted in fly infestation. At Hallam Fields Road, waste was stored in such significant quantities that it posed a fire risk. The company had been under investigation by the Environment Agency following complaints from the public, but despite a number of opportunities to improve its operations, failed to bring the sites back into compliance. In addition, the company operated an illegal waste operation on nearby land at Old Stanton Iron works from February to July 2013. Waste including redox fines and fragmentiser fluff generated from the permitted sites was stored in significant quantities on land without any appropriate permits or in accordance with exemptions. When officers visited, one of the waste piles appeared to be steaming. Speaking following the case, an Environment Agency officer involved with the investigation said: “We grant, monitor and enforce waste permits so that we can ensure that waste operations do not pollute the environment and pose a risk to human health. Donald Ward Limited failed to comply with their environmental permit despite multiple warning letters and enforcement notices issued by the Environment Agency. This prosecution demonstrates that we take cases such as this very seriously and will not hesitate to prosecute if necessary, to protect the environment and local communities”. In passing sentence His Honour Judge Bennett stated that the offences were aggravated by the company’s previous offending history, the length of time over which the offences occurred and the fact that by the time offences at Hallam Fields Road and Old Stanton Iron works were committed, the company knew it was under investigation by the Environment Agency.

/government/news/anaerobic-digestion-plant-to-pay-20000,"Poor site management at an anaerobic digestion (AD) plant in Hockliffe, Bedfordshire led to 3km of watercourses being polluted. Anaerobic digestion plant to pay £20,000  Environment Agency Trinity Hall Biogas Ltd leased the farm land to run the AD plant and owned the operation. On 15 June Luton Magistrates’ Court fined the company £10,000 and ordered it to pay £10,423.79 Environment Agency costs after it pleaded guilty to the offences. Warren Scott, aged 44, of Owles Lane, Buntingford, Hertfordshire, the controlling partner of Scott and Scott, the business operating the plant, accepted a caution at a previous hearing. The court heard that as a result of overflows from the plant in December 2013 and again the following April, water quality was chronically affected in the stream from the farm near Hockliffe to the Ouzel Brook approximately 3km downstream.. Ms Wendy Foster, prosecuting for the Agency, said that Scott had reported an overflow of effluent from a storage container at Trinity Hall Farm between Hockliffe and Dunstable. It had flowed into a nearby ditch which eventually ran into the Ouzel Brook. The storage container held liquid which had leached from a maize heap stored as bio-fuel for an anaerobic digestion (AD) plant. The tank had not been checked and had overflowed. Ms Foster said bags of wrapped bio-fuel, owned by the company, were stored on a field in rows, the ends of which were within 10m of the ditch where the effluent had been found. This is a breach of silage regulations. She said samples of bacterial growth taken from the watercourse indicated an ongoing chronic pollution. Four months later Agency officers went back to the farm to check the water quality of the brook and nearby watercourses and found levels of ammonia at 10milligram a litre, 10 times higher than normally found in similar watercourses. Ms Foster said: Any concentration in excess of 5 milligram per litre is likely to have a toxic effect on aquatic life. The effluent in the tank was only inches from the top and a mud bank had been cleared creating a direct pathway for effluent to reach the watercourse. Effluent was leaking from a pump in several places and running into a ditch. The company told Agency investigators that Scott and Scott were the day to day operators of the AD Plant and were only responsible for emptying the tank if there was an agreement with the company for them to do so. There were no such agreements at the time of the offences, this was an oversight by the company. Ms Foster said the site had been ‘poorly managed’ rather than the pollution being an isolated incident. The offences arose out of negligence of the defendant company. The repeated incidents of pollution and failures to comply with regulations are indicative of inadequate systems and monitoring rather than an isolated incident. The company said it had reported the incident and had since put in place infrastructure to prevent any further offences. The District Judge hearing the case said: Self-reporting the incident was a substantial mitigating factor – the pollutions impacted upon 3km of the watercourse. It is incredulous that there was no system in place to empty the tank. After the hearing Environment Agency officer Kat Wynn said Given that the tank was close to nearby ditches it was reasonably forseeable that any overflow would cause pollution. Operators of businesses that store polluting effluents should have rigorous procedures in place to minimize the risk of an overflow or leak occurring. Regulations are there to follow and guidance for similar operations can be found on the gov.uk website at https://www.gov.uk/guidance/storing-silage-slurry-and-agricultural-fuel-oil Anyone unsure about setting up a similar business should seek proper advice from their local Environment Agency Land and Water team here .

/government/news/high-house-farm-ltd-of-dorchester-fined-for-polluting-stream-twice,"Farm company ordered to pay nearly £12,000 for two counts of polluting with slurry and silage High House Farm Ltd of Dorchester fined for polluting stream twice  Environment Agency A Dorset farm company has been ordered to pay almost £12,000 in fines and costs for polluting the same stream twice – first with slurry and then silage. The spills occurred within five months of each other. The case was brought by the Environment Agency. On February 2, 2015, the Environment Agency received a report of pollution in a stream near Lower Dairy Farm, Poxwell, Dorchester. An officer visited the farm and traced the pollution to a slurry tanker that had been overfilled. Slurry was ‘pouring out’ the top of the tanker and into a land drain before flowing into a copse and entering the stream. The tanker belonged to a contractor that had been hired by High House Farm Ltd to empty a slurry lagoon and spread the slurry on surrounding fields. The farm manager said the contractor had stopped overfilling and had built a bund around the slurry lagoon tankering area to prevent any further pollution. He’d also blocked off a ditch below the land drain with soil. However, when the stream was checked again it was still found to be polluted. A large pond of slurry had formed in the copse below the protective bund around the lagoon and slurry was entering the stream. The farm manager was told to block off discharges and clean up the pond. The Agency found sewage fungus in the stream indicating the pollution had been going on for some time. A director of High House Farm Ltd told the Agency their slurry lagoon had been overflowing for several days before contractors had arrived on site to lower the levels. In a separate incident on June 11, 2015, pollution was discovered in the Osmington Stream. The stream bed was covered with ‘sewage fungus’. This is an indicator of ongoing gross pollution. A member of the public said the smell from the stream had been bad for about a week. The pollution was traced to a silage clamp belonging to High House Farm Ltd. Silage effluent from the clamp was seeping into the stream via a ditch. Magistrates heard that the company planned to spend £150,000 on improvements to the slurry lagoon and silage clamp at Lower Dairy Farm. This was part of a planned expansion of the farm, but the works were brought forward because of the current pollution risk. Chris Westcott of the Environment Agency said: Slurry and silage effluent are highly polluting. Livestock farmers must ensure structures such as slurry lagoons and silage clamps are properly maintained, managed and in good working condition to reduce the risk of pollution. High House Farm Ltd, Dorchester, was fined a total of £5,000 and ordered to pay £6,990 costs by Weymouth magistrates after pleading guilty to discharging without an permit for both incidents contrary to Regulation 12 (1) (b) and 38 (1) (a) of the Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2010."

/government/news/preferred-bidder-for-lydney-harbour-announced,"Following a lengthy selection process the Environment Agency has identified a preferred bidder to become the new custodian of Lydney Harbour Preferred bidder for Lydney Harbour announced  Environment Agency The Environment Agency were fortunate enough to have 2 strong local bidders who had distinct and prosperous visions for the harbour and its place in the surrounding area. They would like to thank them both for their commitment and dedication to a very competitive selection process. After careful consideration and independent assessment the Environment Agency chose Mr Richard Cook of Severn and Wye Smokery as the preferred bidder. The visionary and exciting proposals for the harbour are linked to a wider regeneration initiative for this area of Lydney and will offer many opportunities for the future of the town. The Environment Agency will now begin negotiations around the details of transfer and the associated harbour authority responsibilities. This process is expected to take a while to complete. In the meantime the Environment Agency will continue to manage and operate the harbour and work closely with Mr Cook to ensure solid foundations are put in place to support his proposals and secure a smooth transition. Mr Cook will be invited to a meeting of the Coastal Community Stakeholder Team to share his vision and plans for the harbour and the surrounding area. The Environment Agency will continue to protect the community through the operation and maintenance of the flood risk assets on site throughout the transfer to the new custodian, and once the transfer has been completed. Ian Jones, Area Environment Manager said: “We are committed to supporting the economic regeneration of the Lydney area through our involvement in the Lydney Coastal Community Team. We see transferring the Harbour as an essential step in revitalising the area and ensuring that all users retain the ability to use the Harbour and its surroundings with enhanced facilities. We look forward to working closely with Mr Cook over the coming months.” Mr Cook added: “Severn and Wye Smokery are very honoured and excited to have been chosen as the preferred bidder as custodians of Lydney Harbour. “We will now engage with local communities, council representatives and Environment Agency to help develop and promote what we believe to be one of the Forest of Dean’s hidden gems, and revitalize an asset that will encourage people to come and enjoy one the Severn Estuary’s historic and scenic landmarks.”"

/government/news/united-utilities-and-contractors-fined-almost-1m-for-polluting-brook-with-corrosive-bleach,"United Utilities Water Limited (UU) has been fined £600,000 and its contractor, KMI + £333,000  United Utilities and contractors fined almost £1m for polluting brook with corrosive bleach  Environment Agency United Utilities Water Limited (UU) has been fined £600,000 and its contractor, KMI+ £333,000 at Bolton Crown Court on Friday 24 June 2016 after pleading guilty to polluting a brook. Both companies were also ordered to pay a total of £45,262 in costs (United Utilities £19,090 and KMI+ £26,172) following a prosecution by the Environment Agency. The court heard how KMI+ was contracted by UU to carry out improvement works at Wayoh water treatment works at Turton Bottoms. In December 2013, as part of the works, KMI + emptied and removed a tank which had been used to store sodium hypochlorite in 10% solution. Sodium hypochlorite is used in the water purification process and is also the principle ingredient of household bleach. It is very corrosive and is highly toxic to aquatic organisms. The Honorary Recorder of Bolton, Judge Timothy Clayson, heard that by 4 December 2013 the majority of the contents of the tank had been removed but up to 300 litres of the highly toxic chemical was left in the bottom and needed to be emptied. Counsel Richard Bradley, prosecuting on behalf of the Environment Agency, told the Court that instead of pumping or siphoning the remaining liquid out, a decision was taken to put a hosepipe into the tank and dilute the sodium hypochlorite with water, letting it overflow into a bunded area and leave the hosepipe running unattended overnight for 15 hours. This was carried out without any risk assessment or method statement and the companies were not in agreement on what they understood had been agreed prior to the removal taking place. Neither company had surveyed the drainage adequately and did not realise there were faults in the drainage system which meant the diluted toxic chemical entered the surface water drainage system and discharged to Bradshaw Brook, a trout spawning ground. On December 6 2013, the Environment Agency was alerted by a member of the public who had found dead fish floating in the water. A 1.7km stretch of the brook leading towards Jumbles Reservoir was so badly polluted that virtually all aquatic organisms, including fish, shrimp and earthworms were killed. Up to 900 dead fish were recovered, including Brown Trout, Loaches and Bullheads, but the number killed is likely to be much greater. At the end of June 2014 the brook had recovered sufficiently for restocking to take place and UU paid for the brook to be restocked with native fish from the downstream section. Both UU and KMI+ pleaded guilty at the first available opportunity and cooperated with the prosecution. The Honorary Recorder of Bolton, Judge Timothy Clayson said the incident had arisen through senior management failings to ensure proper system and procedures were in place. Gordon Whitaker, Environment Manager of the Environment Agency, said: This was a serious and avoidable pollution incident caused by the negligence of both parties. It took several months for Bradshaw Brook to return to a healthy state and even then it was necessary to assist this process by restocking fish in the affected stretch. This case should bring home the message to all company directors and shareholders that environmental offences are taken seriously both by the regulators and the courts."

/government/news/flood-repairs-to-worsley-brook-culvert-continues-with-installation-of-concrete-sections,"Work to repair underground culverts in Salford is progressing well.  Flood repairs to Worsley Brook Culvert continues with installation of concrete sections  Environment Agency Since June, contactors for the Environment Agency have been carrying out a series of restorative works on Worsley Brook to reduce the risk of culvert collapse and consequent flooding to 260 local properties. In the past week the teams have started to lift the first of 36, 4-tonne concrete sections into place. These will be used to line the defective areas of the culvert and minimise the risk of flooding to nearby properties. Pumps are being used to divert Worsley Brook around the culvert, enabling the work to be undertaken in dry conditions. These works will stabilise the culvert, making it safe. They are programmed to be completed by mid-September 2016, ensuring they are ‘winter-ready.’ These repairs form part of the Environment Agency’s strategy for managing flood risk across Greater Manchester, which includes carrying out culvert repairs and monitoring for any other damage within the watercourse. In order to ensure the safety of passing pedestrians and motorists, contactors have put in place temporary traffic lights on Barton Road, which have been in place from 9:30am-3:30pm daily. Local business and residents have been given alternative parking options in order to minimise disruption while this important work is completed. Gwen Scott from the Environment Agency said: “We appreciate everyone’s patience during these works and we apologise for any disruption caused by them. “The Environment Agency is committed to reducing flood risk wherever we can and repairing these culverts is vital to managing the risk of flooding in this area. We are working closely with Salford Council to minimise the disruption as much as possible.”"

/government/news/warning-to-bridgwater-homeowners-after-culvert-damage-found,"Environment Agency issues warning after a regular cleaning of a culvert spotted damage from above in Somerset. Warning to Bridgwater homeowners after culvert damage found  Environment Agency A periodic clean-up of water-carrying tunnels beneath Bridgwater in Somerset has reduced flood risk to numerous properties – but spotted problems being caused by homeowners above ground. The culverts – narrow, cramped underground passages – are cleared when blockages occur. But between every six and ten years they are inspected. Unlike the large dredging works recently delivered on the rivers Tone and Parrett, culvert cleansing is not visible but keeping culverts fully functional is rewarded by reducing flood risk. The most recent inspection removed 320 tonnes of silt from a 470m subterranean passageway under Old Taunton Road. However, the Environment Agency’s contractor noticed damage in certain sections of the culvert– likely to have been caused by unwary culvert owners above. John Rowlands of the Environment Agency said: Although not of great concern at the moment, we will monitor the culvert condition. If it worsens or there is new damage we will inform the appropriate landowner. Homeowners own sections of culvert that run under their land to the point it leaves. As owners, they are responsible for maintaining them. Culverts can collapse and cause the ground above to subside if they not maintained properly. The Environment Agency work ensures that the 80 miles of culvert in Bristol and Somerset has the capacity to pass water, but is not responsible for the structure of the culverts itself.

River basin management: working together  Environment Agency This consultation shared the objectives and measures set out in the river basin management plans and asked which issues stakeholders could contribute to. The consultation also gave the opportunity to suggest how to report on progress and to comment on the economic appraisal and environmental assessment work carried out. The consultation on the draft updated river basin management plans consists of 3 main parts: Part 1: Summary and consultation questions Part 2: River basin management planning overview and additional information Part 3: Economic analysis There are also other supporting documents and data available to download to help you respond to this consultation. Part 1: Summary and consultation questions There is a part 1 for each river basin district. It sets out the current state of the river basin district, the challenges it faces and the future objectives and measures that might apply. The questions for the consultation are listed in this document. Part 2: River basin management planning overview and additional information There is one part 2 document for England. This document sets out the detail behind the decision-making which has shaped this draft update to the river basin management plan. It explains each step of the process, linking to more detailed information where appropriate. It allows the user to find the level of detail desired to respond to the consultation. Part 3: Economic analysis There is one economic analysis for England. It has been produced to help people understand the potential implications of 5 future management scenarios for 4 of the sector groupings. Information on costs and benefits is summarised for each river basin district as well as for England. Alongside each part 1 there is a strategic environmental assessment report which we are also consulting on. This report considers the significant environmental effects to the draft update to the river basin management plan to ensure the plan takes these effects into account. Supporting information Supporting documents include a: record of consultation and engagement coastal and estuarine waters national engagement summary printable response form Catchment summaries To help you respond to the consultation, we have summarised key information at a local scale in the catchment summaries.

Speed limits All speed limits are indicated on the River Great Ouse and its tributaries. Speed limits on the Great Ouse vary between 4 mph (6.4 kmph ) to 7 mph (11.2 kmph ). On the tidal section of the river the speed limit is 15mph (24.1 kmph ). There is a speed indication system on the Ely Ouse to make the river safer. Two transit posts have been installed on the riverbank and serve as speed markers. When travelling between the 2 posts it should take at least 30 seconds or longer. If it takes less time than this then you’re speeding and must slow down. Overhead power lines There are headroom restrictions from overhead power lines on the River Great Ouse. Because river levels change and overhead power line heights vary, we cannot provide the heights of power lines. Some network operators specify exclusion zones around power lines, depending on the voltage being transmitted. This is to prevent electricity arcing or jumping from a transmitting wire to a boat mast, for example. If your vessel has raised masts, radio aerials or booms you should contact the local electricity network operator before using the waterway. For more safety advice see the Energy Networks Association guide ‘Safety information for watersports’ . Strong stream advice Locks on the rivers Nene and Great Ouse are ‘reversed’ during floods and high flows. This closes the affected locks to navigation. The Environment Agency recommends that you don’t navigate during these periods. When strong stream advice is in force, signs along the river are activated and some marinas and boat clubs display red flags. Call the floodline information service to find out whether the strong stream advice is in active.

/government/publications/improving-river-habitats-to-support-wildlife-during-low-flows,"A study into the effectiveness of restoration measures to improve river habitats during low flows. Improving river habitats to support wildlife during low flows  Environment Agency Physical modification is one of the main reasons why many rivers do not support thriving wildlife. Engineering and other changes to natural river forms have damaged habitats, reducing populations of plants and animals and reducing their ability to cope with extreme low and high river flows. A particular concern is the effect of low flows during extended dry weather, which may occur more frequently as the climate changes. To allow wildlife to recover and be resilient to a range of river conditions we need to understand how to restore the natural river processes and habitats that species depend on. This study reviewed the results from previous river restoration work and modelled additional measures such as embankment and weir removal at 5 case study sites. The study showed that the models can help to target the most effective restoration schemes and avoid costly measures that are unlikely to succeed."

/government/news/river-medway-boaters-and-wildlife-boosted-by-lock-improvements,"Boaters and wildlife along the River Medway are to receive a boost thanks to a project to refurbish East Farleigh lock. River Medway boaters and wildlife boosted by lock improvements  Environment Agency The Environment Agency is spending £3 million on the refurbishment of the navigation lock, near Maidstone in Kent, and installing a new fish and eel pass. East Farleigh lock was last re-constructed over a century ago and, although safe, the main structure is showing signs of wear. The lock will be completely refurbished as part of a 6 month project that will also include the installation of a new fish pass. Work to restore the lock begins on 12 September 2016, and when it is complete, 9 out of 10 lock sites along the River Medway will have fish passes around their weirs and locks. The new fish pass at East Farleigh will allow coarse and migratory fish the ability to pass the lock and weir complex, allowing fish to reach new spawning grounds and contributing to the overall health of the river. The Environment Agency is the navigation authority for the 31 kilometre stretch of the Upper Medway navigation in Kent, and there are 10 locks and associated sluices and weirs along the 31km long navigation. East Farleigh is the second lock boaters arrive at if visiting from the tidal Medway and heading upstream. Over the last 8 years the Environment Agency has led projects to refurbish 3 of the poorest condition navigation locks; East Farleigh will be the fourth lock to receive this level of investment. Philip Munslow, Environment Agency Waterways Operations Manager said: It is a testament to the previous lock refurbishment that it has lasted over 100 years, especially in such a harsh environment. The construction is made more complicated by the confined nature of East Farleigh lock. However, working with our suppliers we are pleased to be able to invest in this site and bring the lock up to modern standards. The completion of these works will secure this structure for the next 100 years. The new fish pass means that 9 out of 10 lock sites on the Upper Medway will have had their barriers to fish passage removed."
/government/news/composting-site-operator-fined-50000-after-breaching-its-permit,"  Smells from a compositing site next to Cambridge Research Park made nearby workers feel sick, a court has heard. Composting site operator fined £50,000 after breaching its permit  Environment Agency Operator of the site, AmeyCespa (East) Ltd, was fined £50,000 and ordered to pay £13,336 costs after a court heard that in July 2014 an employee at a nearby company was suddenly sick at work. The firm that the employee worked for had had an increase in sickness rates and eventually gave up its lease on the property, at a large penalty cost, and relocated. Cambridge Magistrates’ Court heard that an Environment Agency biowaste specialist was commissioned to visit the site, and a report, which included a list of appropriate measures AmeyCespa should take to prevent or minimise odour, was served on the company two months before the incident. The report said more emphasis should be placed on the management of the composting process to prevent the release of odours instead of relying on deodorising misting sprays. Mr Richard Banwell, prosecuting for the Environment Agency, told District Judge Ken Sheraton: “AmeyCespa failed to implement appropriate measures until after the incident in July and the serving of three enforcement notices.” The company had also failed to submit an adequate odour management plan to the Environment Agency before the July offence. Magistrates heard that enforcement notices required the company to take actions to comply with their permit. By June 2015 all but one of the actions had been complied with, the final one was not completed until December that year. Mr Banwell said AmeyCespa had been negligent in failing to prevent or minimise odours and failing to respond to advice from the Environment Agency to change its composting processes and management until after the incident. He said: “There was a history of non-compliance at the site and there was a serious effect on human senses and it was persistent enough that it led to a widespread change in behaviour of those exposed to it.” “At a nearby business, staff complained of feeling sick, gagging and sore eyes and throats. Staff could not take regular outdoor breaks and sickness rates went up.” AmeyCespa admitted breaching its permit. Mr Richard Matthews QC, mitigating for AmeyCespa, said “AmeyCespa takes this extremely seriously and is genuinely sorry and regretful.” In sentencing the company on 8 September 2016, District Judge Sheraton said: “There had been a great deal of adverse effects on human health, quality of life and air quality. I therefore impose a fine at the maximum of my sentencing powers” After the hearing Environment Agency officer Lucy Bellotti said: “This case shows how permitted waste facilities can significantly impact on the daily lives of people living and working near to them. We are committed to regulating poorly performing waste sites and will use our full range of enforcement powers when operators fail to comply with their permits.” The company pleaded guilty to: On or about 9 July 2014 at a waste management park off Ely Road, Waterbeach, Cambridge you failed to comply with condition 3.4.1 of an Environmental Permit reference EPR/LP3593LM, in that you failed to ensure that emissions from the activities were free from odours at levels likely to cause annoyance outside the site, as perceived by an authorised officer of the Environment Agency, and that you failed to use appropriate measures to prevent or where that is not practicable, to minimise, the odour. Contrary to Regulation 38(2) Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2010"

/guidance/turn-your-waste-into-a-new-non-waste-product-or-material,"Find out when your material achieves end of waste so you can create new products and know waste controls no longer apply. Turn your waste into a new non-waste product or material Waste Environment Agency Work out if your waste material complies with an European Union (EU) end of waste regulation or meets the end of waste test through a quality protocol or an individual assessment . EU end of waste regulations Your first step is to check whether your waste derived product needs to meet the requirements of an EU End of Waste Regulation. There is a regulation for the following waste types: iron, steel and aluminium scrap glass cullet copper scrap Find the EU End of Waste Regulations on the European Commission website . If the EU Regulation requirements cannot be met, then it remains waste. If you can meet them, end of waste is achieved. Meet the end of waste test If no EU End of Waste Regulation applies to your waste derived product, you need to make an end of waste assessment on the basis of the relevant case law on end of waste. The Court of Appeal OSS end of waste test generally represents all the case law requirements for the end of waste test. This test assesses whether: the waste has been converted into a distinct and marketable product, this means: the waste has been turned into a completely new product, for example a playground surface is produced from waste tyres the new product is different from the original waste (minor changes to its composition may not be sufficient), for example non packaging plastic recycled material is processed to make new plastic products there is a genuine market for the material so it will definitely be used – if its stored indefinitely with little prospect for use the material remains waste the processed substance can be used in exactly the same way as a non-waste the processed substance can be stored and used with no worse environmental effects when compared to the material it is intended to replace Quality protocols In England, Wales and Northern Ireland there are several quality protocols available. They are voluntary end of waste frameworks for specific wastes and end uses based on the relevant end of waste case law. Check if a quality protocol applies to your operation . What you’re doing to your waste must meet the requirements set out in the relevant quality protocol to demonstrate end of waste. Generally quality protocols: ensure the product made from waste does not pose an unacceptable risk to human health or the environment increase market confidence in the quality of products made from waste and their potential value encourage greater waste recycling and recovery For guidance on assessing whether excavated materials are classified as waste or not, or when developing or remediating land you can use the The Definition of Waste: Development Industry Code of Practice . If your waste derived product doesn’t meet the requirements in the relevant quality protocol or meet the end of waste test, it will still be waste so you must comply with waste management controls. If you do not comply you could be committing an offence and face a penalty. If there is no applicable quality protocol, you will need to assess whether your waste derived product meets end of waste on a case by case basis using the OSS test. Use the quality protocol checker Use the quality protocol (QP) checker web tool to check if your waste derived aggregate or compost is compliant with a QP and is no longer waste. End of waste test assessment In England, if you produce a product from waste and think it meets the end of waste test, but you’re not sure, you can use the IsItWaste tool to do a self assessment. You can normally submit the self assessment to the Environment Agency for assessment by the Definition of Waste Panel. Unfortunately the panel is temporarily closed and isn’t receiving any new Definition of Waste submissions. The closure will be reviewed in November 2016. You can still undertake self assessment during this time using the IsItWaste tool. If you’re operating in other parts of the UK, contact your environmental regulator to find out what services they provide. Use the IsItWaste tool Use the IsItWaste tool to work out if your waste derived material is a non-waste by-product, has achieved end of waste or is still a waste. First, read the user guide . If you’re unable to use the IsItWaste tool please contact the Definition of Waste team to discuss alternative methods of making a submission by email at endofwaste@environment-agency.gov.uk . If your product is no longer waste, you may also need to comply with: any relevant and applicable product legislation the registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals (REACH) regulations End of waste: more information Defra’s legal definition of waste guidance Regulatory position statement: Regulation of materials under consideration for a Quality Protocol EU Life+ project EQual: Ensuring Quality of waste derived products to achieve resource efficiency Material comparators for end of waste decisions: Manufactured fertilisers Material comparators for end of waste decisions: Applying waste derived materials to land"

/government/news/metaldehyde-advice-for-autumn-crops,"Metaldehyde is a slug pellet that can contaminate watercourses, especially when it rains. Here's how to avoid that happening.  Metaldehyde: Advice for autumn crops  Environment Agency The Environment Agency is calling on growers to think ‘slope, soil and stream’ when they apply metaldehyde based slug pellets to crops this autumn. It is important growers adhere to the current guidelines on metaldehyde use to avoid contaminating watercourses and protect drinking water supplies. Metaldehyde is the pesticide that most often causes risks to drinking water sources, especially in the autumn. Farmers need to operate ‘best practice’ to avoid pollution. If metaldehyde enters watercourses it can potentially threaten drinking water quality. Good practice from farmers is required to prevent metaldehyde entering watercourses. This includes taking into consideration: The slope of the field. Steeper fields are a higher risk. The drainage status of the field. Heavy soils and under-draining are a high risk. The proximity of watercourses or ditches. Fields adjacent to these are high risk. The current and predicted weather. Saturated soils and heavy rain can cause a high risk of runoff. The filling and wash down area of the pellet applicator. Areas which run off to drains or watercourses will have a high risk of pollution. Visit www.wiyby.co.uk and enter the relevant postcode to find out if your land is in a high risk area (safeguard zone) for metaldehyde. Metaldehyde Stewardship Group guidelines promote restrictions to prevent the pesticide from causing water pollution: Use minimum active per ha to avoid drainage and run-off losses Maximum application rate 210g metaldehyde active substance/ha* For additional protection of water, suppliers/BASIS advisors may recommend rates reduced to 160g active substance/ha or less* Maximum total dose from 1 August to 31 December: 210g metaldehyde active substance/ha* For additional protection of water, suppliers/BASIS advisers may recommend rates reduced to 160g active substance/ha or less* Maximum total dose rate: 700g metaldehyde active substance/ha/calendar year* No pellets to be applied within six metres of a watercourse Do not apply when heavy rain is forecast If drains are flowing do not apply metaldehyde based slug pellets *from any combination of metaldehyde products. 700g is also the statutory limit. Alternatives, such as ferric phosphate, are available and you should consider using this or other modes of control if you are in an area where metaldehyde is identified as a risk to drinking water sources. For further advice contact the Metaldehyde Stewardship Group on 0845 177 0117 or visit their website at www.getpelletwise.co.uk ."

/government/news/environment-agency-lends-a-hand-to-local-council,"Officers were on scene at Ipsley Pool, Redditch after receiving a call to help fish in distress from Redditch Borough Council.  Environment Agency lends a hand to local council  Environment Agency The Environment Agency believes natural causes have contributed to a drop in the amount of dissolved oxygen in the pool, making it difficult for fish to breathe. To help, officers immediately called for specialist equipment to aerate the water and bring up the oxygen levels. They are also checking the upstream watercourse to completely rule out pollution as the cause of the incident. Environment Agency fisheries staff have been working with Redditch Borough Council, the owners of the pool, to advise them on what to do if this happens again. Dave Thrussell from the Environment Agency said: “We are on duty 24 hours a day to respond to fish kills and fish in distress. Because of this we could respond quickly, which has reduced the impact on the fish. We’ve been working with Redditch Borough Council and at the end of the day today we’re handing this incident back to them to take forward. “If anyone spots fish in distress in any river or waterway, then please call our incident helpline on 0800 80 70 60.” Protecting fish and water wildlife is part of the Environment Agency’s fisheries management role. Their teams are trained to use aeration equipment or hydrogen peroxide to restore dissolved oxygen levels. As well as encouraging people to call the incident helpline on 0800 80 70 60, the Environment Agency is encouraging private fishery owners to manage fish stocks to appropriate levels and install aerators.

Flood risk maps for surface water: how to use the map  Environment Agency This document gives details about how the flood risk maps for surface water were created and explains the levels of flood risk. Surface water flooding happens when rainwater does not drain away through the normal drainage systems or soak into the ground, but lies on or flows over the ground instead. Managing the risk of flooding from surface water is the responsibility of lead local flood authorities. Lead local flood authorities are the unitary authority or if there is no unitary authority, the county council for the area. They work in partnership with other organisations, including the Environment Agency, district councils, water and sewerage companies to manage local flood risks. The risk of flooding from surface water map was produced by the Environment Agency on behalf of government, using information and input from lead local flood authorities. You can also find out if you’re at risk of flooding from rivers and the sea and reservoirs ."

/government/news/fish-find-shows-mine-water-scheme-is-reaping-rewards,"Environment Agency surveys at Saltburn-by-the-Sea indicate mine water treatment scheme is helping restore a once heavily polluted Gill.  Fish find shows mine water scheme is reaping rewards  Environment Agency There’s early indications that a mine water treatment scheme is reaping rewards after lots of fish were found in a once heavily polluted bright orange watercourse in Saltburn-by-the-Sea. During recent Environment Agency monitoring surveys at Saltburn Gill the water was running clear and fish stocks – including juvenile brown trout, bullheads and a juvenile flounder - were spotted. The encouraging signs come just months after the new Saltburn mine water treatment scheme was officially opened on 1 July. The £3.6million scheme was funded by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) and was carefully designed by Coal Authority experts, in partnership with the Environment Agency and Defra, to address pollution problems caused by historic mining operations. It started operating during 2015. ‘Fantastic to see fish returning’ Environment Minister Thérèse Coffey said: “The water in Saltburn Gill is now running clear and it is fantastic to see fish like the brown trout and European bullhead returning to these rivers. “I am delighted Defra funded this scheme which has made a huge difference to the natural environment, so future generations are able to enjoy these waters once more for years to come.” The Environment Agency’s Richard Jenkins, Team Leader of the North East Analysis and Reporting Team which carried out the surveys, said: “Our rivers are the healthiest they’ve been for 20 years and schemes like this are playing an important role in ensuring water quality improvements continue. “Certainly the results of this survey is excellent news and an early indication that the great partnership work to improve the gill is making a difference for this generation and generations to come. “There appears to be a positive biological response to the work, but there’s still a lot of investigation to do. The monitoring is part of a much wider project looking into the restoration of the watercourse. “We’re carrying out a number of ecological and water quality investigations over the coming months and years to monitor any improvements.” Delighted with excellent performance Tracey Davies, Head of the Environment Team at the Coal Authority, added: “We are delighted with the excellent performance of the system, as it removes in excess of 98% of iron from the raw mine water before the cleaned water is released into the local waterways. “This means we are preventing over 100 tonnes of iron from entering the Saltburn Gill and the North Sea every year. “It is schemes like this that will help us create even more effective and sustainable mine water treatment sites elsewhere in Britain and we have estimated that stopping this iron entering the water at Saltburn-by-the-Sea has the potential to add £10.5million into the local economy over the next 25 years.” The area of East Cleveland saw large scale deep mining for well over 100 years. When local ironstone mining operations stopped in the 1960s, the pumps that removed water from the mines were turned off and removed. Water made its way into the old mine workings and eventually reached the surface in 1999. Although not harmful to people, the iron ochre caused severe pollution to both the Skelton Beck and Saltburn Gill, discoloured the beach and sometimes caused an orange plume to form in the North Sea. A community group – Saltburn Gill Action Group – worked with the Environment Agency and Coal Authority to gain funding to investigate options to clean up the pollution and together they secured the necessary funds from the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to address the issue for the community."

Identification and quantification of groundwater nitrate pollution from non-agricultural sources. literature review  Environment Agency Nitrate has been identified as, and remains, a major water quality issue in the UK, and it originates as a diffuse pollutant in all of the major aquifers and many of the minor aquifers of England and Wales. Considerable scientific effort has been devoted to understanding and quantifying the behaviour of nitrogen inputs from normal agricultural practices, and their transport to groundwater. However, there are other potential sources of nitrate which can affect groundwater. Some of these activities are completely non-agricultural, whilst others are non-arable agricultural, and most are poorly characterised and quantified at present. Under the Nitrate Directive, review of existing Nitrate Vulnerable Zones (NVZs) and new candidate NVZs will be carried out every four years. Scientifically robust yet relatively simple methods need to be used for establishing a balanced perspective of the contributions from non-agricultural, non-arable agricultural and arable agricultural activities."

Know your river conditions Any river activity poses a greater risk when there are strong currents, high river levels or cold weather. River flows can increase even during the summer months – never assume sunny weather means the conditions are not hazardous. Warning boards may be displayed at locks to inform river users of the conditions. Read the explanations of what these mean for you. Don’t take risks and never underestimate the power of the river. When these red boards are displayed on lock gates, we advise users of all boats not to navigate because the strong flows make it difficult and dangerous. People in hire boats arriving at a lock where these boards are displayed should stop immediately and contact their hire boat operator to ask for instructions. When these yellow boards are displayed on lock gates, we advise users of all unpowered boats not to navigate and users of powered boats to find a safe mooring. This is because river flows are likely to strengthen, and red boards could be displayed very soon and without further warning. When these yellow boards are displayed on lock gates, we advise users of all unpowered boats not to navigate and users of powered boats to navigate with caution. Dealing with changing river conditions Read this section carefully to find out what to do if you find yourself in conditions where we advise you to stop navigating. Remember, not all conditions will be serious enough to require all the measures suggested below. Please take the advice to stop. Even the most experienced boater can be caught out, so think about those who could be put in danger if they have to help you. Moor your boat in a safe place, preferably in a marina or at a recognised mooring. Limited space may be available at some locks. Moor against high banks if you can. Ensure your mooring lines are fastened to secure fixings such as bollards, rings or even trees; put out extra lines for additional security and allow enough slack for a further rise in river levels; don’t rely on your own mooring pins or stakes, they might not hold. If possible, put extra fendering (eg scaffold poles or strong timber posts) between your boat and the bank side, to prevent your boat drifting onto the river bank and becoming caught up when levels drop. Make sure you have a safe exit ashore from your boat. If not, you should consider returning home or finding alternative accommodation until conditions improve. If you are running low on essential supplies or have other safety concerns and are not able to vacate your boat safely, treat this as an emergency and dial 999 to ask for evacuation. Those in hire boats: if you are advised to stop navigating, you should stop immediately and contact your hire boat operator and follow their instructions. Please remember your life is more important than your boat. The Environment Agency are not an emergency service and are not able to carry out search and rescue, or provide supplies to stranded boats."

Canterbury waste criminals fined £6,320 for illegal wood disposal  Environment Agency An employee of a Faversham based waste management business and a landowner have been made to pay £6,320 for the illegal disposal of waste wood at Woodside House in Canterbury. Ky Campion was fined £2,150 with £750 costs after pleading guilty to depositing waste wood without an environmental permit at Folkestone Magistrates’ Court on 26 October 2016. Mr Campion is a Director of East Kent Recycling Ltd but pleaded guilty in a personal capacity. In addition, landowner Luke Lockhart pleaded guilty to causing or permitting the operation of a regulated facility without an environmental permit and was fined £2,670 with £750 costs. The Environment Agency received complaints of burning waste at the site. In December 2013, the Environment Agency sent advice and guidance letters to Luke Lockhart after witnessing an East Kent Recycling Ltd vehicle which appeared to have deposited its contents at Woodside House, a non-permitted site. Reports of burning waste continued and in May 2014 Environment Officers observed more waste being deposited at the site by an East Kent Recycling Ltd vehicle. Alan Cansdale, Environment Manager said: Ky Campion and Luke Lockhart’s actions showed a blatant disregard for the environment. In cases like this, we have no hesitation in prosecuting those involved. We want to ensure that the right waste gets to the right place."

Other rivers are called ‘ordinary watercourses’. The main river map also shows where the Environment Agency intends to make changes. These are highlighted as ‘additions’ and ‘deletions’. Main rivers are usually larger rivers and streams. The Environment Agency carries out maintenance, improvement or construction work on main rivers to manage flood risk. Lead local flood authorities, district councils and internal drainage boards carry out flood risk management work on ordinary watercourses. View the main river map . In England, the Environment Agency decides which watercourses are main rivers. It consults with other risk management authorities and the public before making these decisions. The main river map is then updated to reflect these changes. A river’s designation may affect you if you: live by a river own land or property by a river need to carry out works in or near a river Read guidance about the rights and responsibilities of riverside ownership . Why we change the main river map There are 2 reasons why the Environment Agency changes the main river map. Designation changes This is where the designation of the river changes to or from a main river. This means there is a change in who has legal power to carry out flood risk management work. Factual changes This is where the Environment Agency amends sections of the main river map to reflect changes in the environment or to correct inaccuracies. These changes only correct the line of the main river and do not change who has legal power to carry out flood risk management work. Decision notices (notices to be live for 6 weeks) "

/government/news/dredging-company-fined-40000-for-unlicensed-deposits,"On the 21 August 2015 Westminster Dredging Company Limited appeared at Plymouth Magistrates Court. Dredging company fined £40,000 for unlicensed deposits  Marine Management Organisation On the 21 August 2015 Westminster Dredging Company Limited appeared at Plymouth Magistrates Court in respect of 1 charge of carrying out marine licensable activity otherwise in accordance with a marine licence contrary to section 65 of the Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009. The charge related to a dredging and disposal campaign carried out by the company on behalf of the Defence Infrastructure Organisation for the Ministry of Defence between 17 and 25 September 2014 when dredged material from HM Naval Dockyard at Devonport was deposited at an authorised disposal site south of Rame Head. At the time of the dredging and disposal campaign Westminster Dredging Company Limited had a marine licence but it did not cover 31 of the 32 disposals that were made during that period by the company’s vessel WD Mersey. The Marine Management Organisation (MMO) began an investigation after a member of the public complained about the dredging and disposal activity. The company co-operated from the beginning of the investigation and throughout and provided the MMO with a complete set of co-ordinates and start/end times for each disposal which assisted the investigation. On 11 November 2014 an official from Westminster Dredging Company Limited was interviewed and admitted the offence claiming that the unlicensed deposits were as a result of a failure of the company’s internal procedures and management systems which resulted in the master of the WD Mersey not being aware of the locational restrictions on the depositing of the dredged material. As part of the investigation the MMO sought advice on the likely environmental impact from the 31 unlicensed deposits and concluded that any impacts from these disposals were within acceptable limits. On 30 April 2014 Westminster Dredging Company Limited had been issued by the MMO with an official written warning concerning 2 breaches of the marine licence it held. Both breaches occurred in March 2014. One breach related to a failure to notify local mariners and fishermen’s organisations of proposed work and the second was in relation to depositing material at an unauthorised time. Having heard the facts and the mitigation put forward on behalf of the company the court agreed with the MMO that the company had been negligent in its actions and decided that the appropriate level of fine, taking into account the sentencing guidelines on environmental offences was £40,000. The company was also ordered to pay £3,534 in costs and a victim surcharge of £120."

Outcome of review on Whitsand and Looe Bay MCZ Sub Tidal Mud  Marine Management Organisation Read the [InlineAttachment:1] During the processing of a licensing application in late January 2015, the MMO was advised by Natural England of the existence of an area of sub tidal mud situated in the Whitsand and Looe Bay MCZ. The MCZ is in the proximity of the Rame Head disposal site. Following the advice from Natural England, which identified the sub tidal mud as part of a separate verification process to develop evidence on the MCZ , the MMO asked our scientific advisors (Cefas) to review historical sediment data obtained under the Dredged Material Disposal Site Monitoring programme in relation to the existence of the mud. Furthermore, Cefas were asked to ascertain whether any pathways exist between disposal operations at Rame Head and the mud found to be present in the MCZ. Cefas reviewed historical sediment data and has advised the MMO that the mud habitat has been recorded at this location within the MCZ since Rame Head monitoring began in 2001 and that surveys suggest it is a stable habitat supporting a well-established community of benthic organisms. It is not possible to determine the origin of the subtidal mud habitat within the MCZ, however it is unlikely that the subtidal mud is attributable to disposal activities at the Rame Head site. The MMO is leading a characterisation study with users of the Rame Head disposal site to identify a sustainable longer term site for disposal of dredged material. John Tuckett, Chief Executive Officer said: “As a responsible marine manager we took a precautionary approach and did not licence any disposal at the Rame Head site until we were clear on whether the patch of mud in the MCZ was attributable to dredged sediment disposal activities at Rame Head. “Now that we have clarity, the site becomes a viable option for disposal although the MMO recognise that there are public concerns at Rame Head and we are working with key users of the existing site with a view to finding a suitable alternative site to enable long-term sustainable disposal operations in the south-west.” Read the [InlineAttachment:1]"

Exciting opportunity to manage inshore fisheries and conservation 2016  Marine Management Organisation The MMO is looking to recruit members for the North Western, North Eastern and Southern Inshore Fisheries and Conservation Authorities (IFCA). Each IFCA needs members who will take a balanced approach to caring for the seas, assessing the priority and importance of all users and stakeholders. The vacancies are an opportunity for someone who wants to improve the quality of the inshore areas and are available in the following regions: The North Western IFCA is looking for two new members with experience and interest in the marine environment, particularly with knowledge of the southern part of the district. The North Eastern IFCA is looking for one new member with experience and interest in commercial fisheries, with expertise in sectors other than Shellfish and parts of the district other than Scarborough. The Southern IFCA is looking for one new member with experience and interest in recreational fisheries. David Abbott, Head of Marine Compliance for the Marine Management Organisation, which is carrying out the recruitment said: “This is an excellent opportunity for experienced people in the inshore marine area to use their skills to influence decisions on how their local area is managed.” The deadline for applications is 15 February 2016. The role is on a voluntary basis although relevant expenses may be reimbursed. More information on the vacancy and how to apply for it. You can also email ifcarecruitment@marinemanagement.org.uk or telephone 0300 123 1032 for more information. Background There are 10 IFCAs around the English coastline and they are responsible for sustainably managing sea fisheries and conservation within 6 nautical miles from shore. They have the power to make byelaws to protect resources and the environment in their area as well as also enforcing national and European fisheries legislation. IFCAs are either committees or joint committees of the local authorities that fall within an IFC district. They are tasked with sustainably managing inshore sea fisheries and conserving their local marine environment. They are made up of representatives from local councils along with people from across the different sectors that use or are knowledgeable about the inshore marine area, such as commercial and recreational fishermen, environmental groups and marine researchers, who offer their time voluntarily. The Marine Management Organisation, Environment Agency and Natural England also each has a statutory seat on the IFCA. Through their local management and funding structures, IFCAs help put local councils, communities and businesses, and individual citizens in the driving seat, allowing them to play a bigger part in the protection and enhancement of their inshore marine environment."
/government/news/fishing-restrictions-for-bass-in-2016,"Clarification and guidance and the new measures. Clarification on fishing restrictions for Bass in 2016  Marine Management Organisation When the European Union (EU) publishes the annual regulations allocating total allowable catch and quotas to member states (the T&Q regulation), a number of new restrictions for catches of sea bass will be introduced. This article seeks to answer the key questions surrounding the new measures for commercial and recreational fisherman. UPDATE: The European Union has now published the annual T&Q regulation and the measures relating to catches of sea bass come into force at 00:01hrs on 29 January 2016. General information What are the new measures which are being introduced for commercial fisheries for sea bass? An in depth guide to the new measures can be seen on the Marine Management Organisation (MMO) website: When do the new measures take effect? The new measures will be contained in the annual T&Q regulation which will become law when the EU publishes it in the Official Journal. A draft of the text of the regulation can be seen on the Council of Europe website . (N.B It must be noted that the draft text is not an official regulation of the EU until it is published and may be subject to changes). Can I catch what I want until the regulation is published? No. Until the publication of the 2016 T&Q regulation, the 2015 regulation (Council Regulation (EU) 2015/104 remains in force and commercial fishing vessels remain subject to conditions contained in the fishing vessel licence How will I know when the 2016 regulation has been published? The EU has now published the annual T&Q regulation: Council regulation (EU) 2016/71 . The measures come into force on 29 January 2016. Commercial fisheries What happens if I have fished up to the 2015 monthly limit before the 2016 regulation comes into force? MMO will continue to enforce the 2015 limits on sea bass in January 2016 until the 2016 regulation comes into force. When the 2016 regulation comes into force vessels which will be prohibited from fishing for bass must not catch any more sea bass. For those vessels which remain eligible to catch bass (i.e. vessels using demersal trawls and catching no more than 1% bass by-catch and those vessels using hooks and lines and fixed gill nets in months other than February and March), the following rules apply: in the event you have fished up to the monthly limit in the 2015 regulation, but exceeded the reduced limit in the 2016 regulation you must not catch any more sea bass in January or you will be in breach of the new regulations any catches retained on board or landed after the coming into force of the 2016 regulation will be enforced by MMO against those limits if you have not yet caught up to the monthly limit in the 2016 regulation by the time it comes into force then you may continue to fish for sea bass up to the reduced limits in the 2016 regulation What is the definition of a fixed gill net? The legal definition of a fixed gill net is contained in European legislation, specifically article 3(g) and (h) of Council Regulation (EC) 850/1998 and reads as follows: (g) bottom set gill nets or entangling nets shall mean any fixed gear made up of a single piece of net, fixed, or capable of being fixed, by any means to the bottom of the sea; (h) trammel nets shall mean any fixed gear made up of two or more pieces of net hung jointly in parallel on a single headline, fixed, or capable of being fixed, by any means to the bottom of the sea; Recreational Fishing Can I catch what I want until the 2016 regulation is published? No; the 2015 restrictions on recreational fisheries remain in force, as follows: In recreational fisheries in ICES divisions IVb, IVc, VIIa, VIId, VIIe, VIIf, VIIg, VIIh, VIIj and VIIk not more than three specimens of sea bass may be retained per person per day. What happens after the 2016 regulation is published? The new rules must be complied with from that point onwards."
/government/news/spurdog-picked-dogfish-by-catch-avoidance-programme,"Organisations work closely to develop a spurdog by-catch avoidance programme. Spurdog (picked dogfish) by-catch avoidance programme  Marine Management Organisation Following significant efforts by all involved, a by-catch allowance was secured that enabled further development of this novel approach to manage spurdog: eliminating high levels of dead discarding; reducing fishing mortality; continuing stock recovery; and avoiding a potential ‘choke’ species under the landing obligation. Organisations involved: Cornish Fish Producers Organisation (CFPO) Cornish fishing fleet, Centre for Environment Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas) Department for the Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), Shark Trust Marine Management Organisation (MMO) We are now moving to the next phase; expanding use of the spurdog by-catch reporting tool to 6 vessels, using a variety of gears such as trawls and nets, in the South West. This pilot project requires fishermen to provide real-time, daily reports of their spurdog by-catch, using a grid reference system. This information is used to produce advisory maps, using a ‘traffic-light’ system to inform fishers of areas where there is a risk of encountering this species. A 2 Tonne (t) monthly by-catch allowance is permitted for those participating vessels. Only those spurdog that are dead at the moment when the fishing gear is hauled on board the vessel can be retained, landed and sold. Any spurdog encountered beyond this allocation has to be reported in line with the project requirements but cannot be retained and landed. Use of the reporting tool and uptake of the by-catch allowance will be closely monitored by the CFPO, MMO and Cefas. The CFPO is also working closely with Cefas and the Shark Trust to train skippers in the operation of the daily reporting tool and handling of spurdog to maximise survivability. The Shark Trust has played an active role in producing a code of conduct and handling guide that the vessels will follow when engaged on this programme. Full traceability through the supply chain will be achieved by the use of tallies attached to the boxes of spurdog prior to them being landed. The tallies will identify the dead spurdog that have been landed legally under this programme for onward sale. As part of the selection process, those vessels selected have space on board to facilitate the appropriate handing of spurdog, represent the gear types known to interact with spurdog, and are able to submit daily reports when fishing. The MMO have issued dispensation letters to the selected vessels taking part in the avoidance programme that allows those vessels to retain on-board and land dead spurdog. If you would like any further information, please contact Cefas on 01502 527719 or CFPO on 01736 351050.

Belfast Coastguard received a call on VHF channel 16 just after 1pm this afternoon reporting that three canoeists had fallen into the water between Rams Island and Sandy Bay. Conditions on the water at the time were described as choppy, with a southerly wind of force 4 (13–17 miles per hour). The Kinnegoe Coastguard Rescue Team along with the Kinnego and Ardboe Independent Rescue Boats were sent to the scene. The three, who were all wearing lifejackets, were rescued from the water by a sand barge that was close by at the time. They were then transferred to the Ardboe rescue boat, and taken ashore where they were met by Coastguard Rescue Officers and passed into the care of the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service. Liam Colquhoun, Watch Manager at Belfast Coastguard, said: These 3 canoeists all had lifejackets on, but unfortunately they weren’t wearing wet suits or any type of gear that would help keep them warm. They were passed into the care of paramedics showing signs of hypothermia. We always recommend that canoeists and kayakers are well prepared before setting out. Check weather and tides, wear a buoyancy aid, suitable clothing and carry a VHF marine band radio with you. Where there is good network coverage then it is worth carrying a mobile phone in a waterproof bag.

Portland Coastguard received a mayday message from the dive boat ‘Skua’ on Saturday, 3 May 2014, reporting that a group of canoeists in 3 lightweight boats were having problems in difficult weather conditions and needed immediate assistance. The Coastguard broadcast a mayday relay requesting help from other vessels and also requested the launch of the 2 Swanage RNLI lifeboats. 9 of the 12 canoeists were rescued by a combination of Skua and another boat ‘Playtime’ along with the 2 lifeboats. The other 3 people were escorted back to shore. All 12 were taken back to Knoll Beach, Studland. There were no injuries. It transpired that 6 of the people had been pitched into the water when the 6-man canoe capsized. Ros Evans, Portland Coastguard Watch Manager said: The 12 canoeists were out in difficult weather conditions, in easterly winds off Old Harry Rocks which has a notorious race and with the sea temperature still at winter levels. They were dressed only in shorts and t-shirts. They were wearing buoyancy aids but appeared to have no other safety gear, no rescue equipment and most worryingly, no way > of raising the alarm. They were fortunate that the Skua happened to be in the vicinity and was able to offer assistance, despite having divers in the water. We would recommend that all boaters wear a personal flotation device, appropriate to their sport, such as a lifejacket or buoyancy aid. It’s imperative that the weather, sea conditions and tides are checked and that people ensure that they have the experience and training to be able to cope before setting out. A way of calling for help should the worst happen is also essential. A VHF radio is ideal, but other methods could include marine distress flares or mini flares and a mobile phone as a back-up (although do not rely upon this as coverage off the coast is patchy).

Figures suggest lifejacket wear increase has led to fewer deaths  Maritime and Coastguard Agency This figure has just been released by the Casualty Review Panel in the Fatality Review Statistics for lifejackets 2007-2013 and 2013 Figures for lifejacket fatalities The number of people who died without a lifejacket/buoyancy aid, who may have lived if they had worn one, has been decreasing since 2007. The panel has suggested that increasing awareness of the benefits of buoyancy aid and lifejacket wear may have helped to reduce the numbers of lives lost over the last few years. The Casualty Review Panel meets once a year to discuss the circumstances surrounding fatal maritime incidents. It provides its opinion about whether a lifejacket or buoyancy aid might have saved a person’s life. This year the panel commented that other safety measures, in addition to buoyancy wear, are important in ensuring safety. These include carrying a means of raising an alarm, getting trained, knowing how to call for help, being suitably dressed, being aware of public rescue equipment at certain locations and checking weather conditions and tides. These figures and the accompanying text cover all personal flotation devices including lifejackets and buoyancy aids. These figures have been compiled by an expert panel review comprising: Angling Trust, RNLI, Royal Yachting Association, Marine Accident Investigation Branch, Maritime and Coastguard Agency, National Water Safety Forum, British Canoe Union, the lifejacket industry, Scottish Fishermen’s Federation and University of Portsmouth. The panel uses data supplied from Coastguard and MAIB databases and therefore covers mostly coastal incidents.

/government/news/teenager-rescued-off-mevagissey-after-asking-for-help-on-facebook,"An 18-year-old man has been rescued after his dinghy capsized off Mevagissey. Teenager rescued off Mevagissey after asking for help on Facebook  Maritime and Coastguard Agency Brixham Coastguard was contacted just before 11pm last night by police who’d taken a call from the teenager’s mum. She said he had posted on Facebook saying he was in trouble on his Laser sailing dinghy. Mevagissey and St. Austell Coastguard Rescue Teams, the Fowey RNLI all-weather and inshore lifeboats, police and the ambulance service were sent to the area. The man was spotted in the water by the inshore lifeboat approximately ½ mile south east of Black Head. He was pulled on board the lifeboat and taken back to Fowey. He was then transferred to Treliske hospital to be checked over. Andy Huber, Watch Manager at Brixham Coastguard, said: This young man was extremely lucky to be found when he was. He told rescuers that his mobile phone had got wet and he couldn’t make a 999 call to the Coastguard. However, he did manage to post something on Facebook. He also told lifeboat crews he had been in the water for 2 hours and was trying to swim back to shore, even though he did not have a buoyancy aid or lifejacket on. We always recommend that if you’re heading out on the water that you are well equipped with the necessary communications and safety equipment. Carry a VHF radio with you, a charged mobile phone in a waterproof bag, distress flares and an emergency beacon. These will all help you alert the Coastguard if you’re in trouble, and a much more reliable way than posting for help on social media. [Contact:1507]"

Major search after reports of cliff drama in Torquay  Maritime and Coastguard Agency Brixham Coastguard received a call just after 2pm on Saturday 12 July 2014 from South West Ambulance Service who had been made aware that people were in trouble on cliffs at Meadfoot beach. With little information to go on, Brixham Coastguard sent the Torbay, Berry Head and Teignmouth Coastguard Rescue Teams to the scene, along with both Torbay RNLI lifeboats, Torbay Council patrol boat, police helicopter, Devon Air Ambulance, as well as police and ambulance crews. A thorough search of the area was carried out, but teams were stood down just after 5pm, when nothing was found. Matt Thornhill, Watch Manager at Brixham Coastguard, said: This was a large scale, multi-agency search that lasted for around 3 hours. With the information we had been provided, we were extremely concerned for the people’s safety. However, nothing was found during the thorough search and units have since stood down. We now believe this to be a hoax. Hoax calls are wasteful and potentially life threatening – they tie up valuable search and rescue resources which may have been required elsewhere in a real lifesaving incident. Police are continuing with their enquiries in relation to this incident. [Contact:1507]"

Coastguard safety appeal as hot weather continues  Maritime and Coastguard Agency From 21 June to 21 July 2014, there were 2,549 incidents listed on the Coastguard database, ranging from struggling swimmers, cliff fallers to broken down boats and kayakers in difficulty. Now with the start of the school summer holidays, Coastguards are reminding people of a few top tips to help them stay safe and enjoy their time at the coast. Richard Martin, Chief Coastguard, said: During this recent spell of good weather, we’ve seen a lot of people head to the beautiful UK coastline to enjoy the sunshine. The key thing to remember first of all is that if you see someone in difficulty, or you get into trouble yourself, call 999 immediately and ask for the Coastguard. If you are heading out for a swim, remember that even though the sea may look calm on the surface, there is the danger of strong currents underneath. We recommend that you swim at a lifeguarded beach, take note of any warning signs and best to tell someone on the beach what you are doing so they can keep an eye on you. Always check tide times before you head out for a walk and away from beach access points so that you can avoid being cut off by the incoming tide. When walking along cliff tops, make sure you are wearing suitable footwear and don’t venture too close to the edge. Always keep dogs on a lead. If you’re heading out in a boat, canoe, kayak and such like, you should wear an appropriate lifejacket or buoyancy aid. The key thing to remember is to have a great time but call us if you need us. You know our number: 999 and ask for the Coastguard. Coastguard database figures for previous months   21 May to 21 June 2014 2,184 incidents 21 April to 21 May 2014 1,692 incidents [Contact:1507]"

The caller then reported that 2 people were in the water clinging on to a buoy about a ¼ mile off shore as the RHIB circled near them. The Hastings Coastguard Rescue Team plus the Hastings inshore RNLI lifeboat were sent to the scene. When they got there, they found the 2 people had managed to swim back to shore where they were met and looked after by the Coastguard rescue officers and an ambulance crew. It doesn’t appear that they suffered any injuries. The RHIB meanwhile was still circling just off shore but the crew of the lifeboat managed to bring it under control and cut off the engine. Nicola Goodban, Watch Manager at Dover Coastguard, said: “This Sunday morning boat trip could easily have ended in tragedy. It appears the driver of this RHIB was not wearing a kill cord, which meant when the people on board were thrown into the water, there was no way to stop the engine and bring the boat under control. “We always recommend you wear a kill cord when out on a power boat. One end of the kill cord is attached near the throttle and the other should go around the helmsman’s leg. You should always check your kill cord works at the start of each day or session and remember to renew it regularly.” [Contact:1507]"

His friend’s kayak had capsized and then sunk and he was now in the water. He was not wearing a buoyancy aid. Another kayaker had attempted to tow the kayaker whose vessel had capsized to shore but quickly had to abandon this attempt and gave him his buoyancy aid. Meanwhile, Swansea Coastguard requested the Horton RNLI inshore lifeboat to launch and sent the Oxwich Coastguard Rescue Team to the scene. The lifeboat quickly found the kayaker who was still in his boat safe and well. They searched for the second kayaker in the bay for 20 minutes and were eventually able to hear his calls for help and rescue him from the water as the light was fading. Swansea Coastguard’s Marc Lancey said: We were very relieved that the lifeboat was able to find the man in the water before darkness fell. He was wearing a grey t-shirt and grey buoyancy aid and was therefore difficult to locate in the sea. If you are going kayaking, always wear a buoyancy aid. Take at least a couple of means of calling for help with you. A VHF radio is ideal backed up by mini marine flares and a mobile phone sealed inside a plastic bag. [Contact:1507]"
/government/news/skipper-fined-after-failing-to-keep-a-lookout,"Failing to keep a proper lookout has landed a Whitley Bay fishing boat skipper with a bill of £3,600 in fines and legal costs. Skipper fined after failing to keep a lookout  Maritime and Coastguard Agency In a hearing at Newcastle Magistrates Court this week, Darren Senior of Whitley Bay admitted operating his boat on autopilot while he worked at the stern on Sunday 22 December 2013. As a result, the 9-metre Amadeus collided with another fishing boat. Although no-one was injured and structural damage was minimal, the vessel struck by Amadeus took on water following the collision. The court heard that Mr. Senior, a fisherman with more than 30 years’ experience, had finished a day’s fishing about 6-miles east of the entrance to the River Tyne and had seen the boat he hit, which he assumed was also heading back to port. However, the vessel was actually stationary while its crew dealt with the boat’s nets. They had seen the Amadeus approaching but had assumed it was coming to offer assistance following an earlier radio message about the problem with their nets. Mr. Senior realised a collision was imminent moments before it happened and tried to take avoiding action. When interviewed by Maritime and Coastguard Agency ( MCA ) officers Mr Senior admitted operating his vessel alone on autopilot. At Newcastle Magistrates Court on Tuesday 5 August, he pleaded guilty to failing to keep a proper lookout, as required by Rule 5 of the International Regulations for the prevention of collisions at sea. In sentencing, the court took into consideration Mr Senior’s full cooperation with the MCA , as well as his early guilty plea. He was fined £1,000 with £2,500 costs and a £100 victim surcharge. MCA surveyor Robert Jackson said: It is essential that vessels maintain a proper and effective lookout at all times. This case highlights the risk of making assumptions, rather than a proper assessment. There is an additional factor associated with single crewed vessels, where skippers should remain particularly vigilant for their own and others’ safety. [Contact:1507]"

Man rescued from sea off Swanage after speedboat incident  Maritime and Coastguard Agency Portland Coastguard received several 999 calls just after midday on Saturday 9 August 2014, reporting that a speedboat was circling around a man in the water. There were also several people on pedalos in the vicinity. The man had been on board his boat and acting as safety boat for the pedalos when he noticed that a child was being blown out to sea on a kayak. As he was making his way towards the child, he was flipped out of his boat and into the water. Several personal water craft were in the vicinity and assisted the man including one which was able to get control of the boat and help the man back on board. Portland Coastguard Watch Manager Cindy Rodaway said: We are very relieved that everyone is safe and well and that there are no injuries resulting from this incident. This incident highlights the importance of wearing a kill cord whilst in charge of a motorboat. The kill cord, is designed to kill your engine in the event of you going overboard. All owners and drivers of open powerboats, personal watercraft and RIBs should ensure that if their boat is fitted with a kill switch and kill cord, it is correctly used. On a powerboat the kill cord should be attached securely around the thigh and on a personal watercraft it should be attached to the buoyancy aid. [Contact:1507]"
/guidance/inland-waterways-categorisation-of-waters,"Guidance for owners, operators and masters of vessels on inland waters, explaining the classifications and how to apply for categorisation. Inland waterways: categorisation of waters Inland waterways Construction, maintenance and operation standards Maritime and Coastguard Agency Overview Inland water categorisation policy and processes are dealt with by the Navigation Safety Branch (NSB) of Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA). This guide is for commercial vessel operators, and anyone else who needs to know the correct categories of waters. Knowing the categories will affect: the type of vessel you can operate the safety equipment and crew qualifications you’ll need onboard What inland waters are Inland waters are any area of water, such as canals, tidal and non-tidal rivers, lakes, and some estuarial waters, not categorised as ‘sea’. The UK has over 4,000 miles of inland waterways. They’re not regarded as ‘sea’ for the purposes of most merchant shipping legislation. How inland waters are classified Inland waters are classified as one of four categories: Category A: narrow rivers and canals where the water is generally less than 1.5 metres deep Category B: wider rivers and canals where the water is generally 1.5 metres or more deep, and where the significant wave height couldn’t be expected to be more than 0.6 metres at any time Category C: tidal rivers, estuaries and large, deep lakes and lochs where the significant wave height couldn’t be expected to be more than 1.2 metres at any time Category D: tidal rivers and estuaries where the significant wave height couldn’t be expected to be more than 2 metres at any time Water categorisation matters are co-ordinated by the Navigation Safety Branch of MCA. These categories are defined and listed in MSN 1837 . How to apply for categorisation or re-categorisation of waters You (as an individual or organisation) can apply for categorisation, or to change an existing categorisation,of a defined area of inland water. You must have an interest in the area requested. MCA will consider any request for the categorisation of new or for changes in the existing categorisation of areas. The NSB co-ordinates the categorisation of a defined area of water. Contact your local marine office to get advice about categorisation of a particular stretch of water and making an application. Your application to your local Marine Office needs to be fully supported with: chart of location recent sounding charts levels of vessel movement types of vessel using the area physical description of the area predominant wind chart for the area general rationale to support the application supporting letter from the local harbour or navigation authority details of significant wave heights (see ‘more about significant wave heights’) More about significant wave heights For your application, you must also give evidence showing how the significant wave height has been established. In each category, a maximum significant wave height has been given. Your evidence needs to show that the wave height does not go above this limit at a representative point (or points) in the area you wish to have categorised or re-categorised. This evidence could, for example, be based on information taken from a mathematical model of the geographic area. This should be validated by wave height observations from a wave rider buoy, or a seabed pressure sensor. Maximum significant wave height limits: Category B: up to 0.6 metres Category C: up to 1.2 metres Category D: up to 2.0 metres MCA will not normally ask for wave data evidence for Category B limits, as long as it’s satisfied that the waves are unlikely to go above 0.6 metres. The time of year your application covers will also be a factor. For an application for a winter or summer seasonal area, measurements should represent the period of worst weather. For all-year-round applications, measurements should represent the worst winter conditions. In addition to wave height data you should also consider other factors such as the: strength of any tidal stream effect of the prevailing wind against the tidal stream which can shorten the sea - giving rise to steeper waves which are more liable to break height of banks at the water’s edge and the degree of shelter that may be found in bad weather effect of any surrounding high land which may give rise to sudden and unpredictable wind shifts and strengths fetch of the wind - especially in long, straight estuaries with a low lying hinterland effect of underwater banks on the tidal streams effect of shifting underwater sand banks which result in changing navigational channels relevant local phenomena, such as a tidal bore How your application is processed Send your application and supporting documents to the local Marine Office for the attention of the Surveyor-in-Charge (SIC) or Area Operations Manager (AOM). The SIC or AOM will consult the District Safety Committee or Small Passenger Ship Steering Group as appropriate. If they’re content with the application they’ll send their comments or recommendations to the NSB. If not, they’ll ask you for further or clearer information. The NSB will review the application and submit it to the next bi-annual meeting of the Limits Committee of Focal Point Group 2 (FP2). FP2 will make recommendations to MCA’s Technical Advisory Group for review, and whether or not to grant approval. The NSB will send the TAG’s decision to the local marine office. The marine office will then tell you the decision. Further information See the map and full list of UK navigation authorities on the Association of Inland Navigation Authorities (AINA) .

Coastguards will be on stand J029 in Mayflower Hall from 12 – 21 September 2014. Tristam Newey, Coastguard Commander at the NMOC , said: Changes being made to the Coastguard will see a new national network which will be able to balance out the workload between all of our Coastguards around the country. This means they’ll be a much bigger and better support network able to step in and help out if one of our UK centres is dealing with multiple incidents. More than 2,000 leisure craft have been helped by the Coastguard in the past year alone (1 September 2013 – 1 September 2014). The incidents ranged from boats running out of fuel, dismasted yachts, to vessels running aground and boats taking on water and then sinking. The response to all these search and rescue incidents will remain the same with the new set up.

Too many passengers lands ferry company in court  Maritime and Coastguard Agency At Portsmouth Magistrates Court on Tuesday 23 September the master, operator and owner of the ferry, Tina Maria, were each charged with four counts of sailing without a valid passenger certificate, and two charges of sailing with insufficient liferafts onboard. All three pleaded guilty to all charges, which were brought by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA). Tina Maria is an 11-metre long, single-engined boat used as a ferry between Hayling Island and Eastney, across the entrance to Langstone Harbour. The vessel is certified to carry 12 passengers and two crew. On four occasions in January and February of this year the boat, which is operated by Hayling Ferry Ltd, landed between 16 and 27 passengers at Hayling Island; in all cases the majority of passengers were children returning home from schools in Portsmouth. The Master of the Tina Maria, Geoffrey Oliver (age 58) was fined £900 plus costs of £400. He has to pay a victim surcharge of £20. The owner of the vessel, Frida Edwards (age 54) was fined £600, plus costs of £300. She also has to pay a victim surcharge of £20. The operator of the Tina Maria, Hayling Ferry Ltd, was fined £6,000, plus costs of £4,000. The company will have to pay a victim surcharge of £100. On all the occasions listed in court, the vessel had inadequate lifesaving equipment for all the adults and children on board: Tina Maria carried 14 adult lifejackets; 12 child lifejackets and had liferaft capacity for 18 passengers and crew. Captain Amir Esmiley, Surveyor-in-Charge at the MCA’s Southampton Marine Office, said: There was a clear lack of concern for the safety of passengers which was made worse as the majority of people on the four crossings were children. The limits on the number of passengers that can be on a vessel are there to ensure that everyone has a proper lifejacket and a place in a liferaft. [Contact:1507]"

But the public won’t notice any difference. If you call 999 and ask for the Coastguard, or issue a mayday broadcast, we will still be here to help you. “The new national Coastguard network will be able to oversee and assist with operations around the whole of the UK. Here at Milford Haven CGOC we’re now part of this network, so we can call upon help from our fellow Coastguards elsewhere in the country, and also in turn help them out if needed. “It’s vital to remember though that the rescue teams in your community are unaffected.

/government/news/first-successful-breeding-record-of-ospreys-at-national-nature-reserve,"A pair of rare ospreys have successfully raised two male chicks on Natural England’s Roudsea Wood and Mosses National Nature Reserve in South Cumbria, the organisation announced today. First successful breeding record of ospreys at National Nature Reserve  Natural England It is the first time that a pair of ospreys have nested on one of Natural England’s National Nature Reserves and it is hoped that the birds – which tend to be faithful to a nest site - will return to breed at Roudsea Wood and Mosses NNR in future years and raise many more young. There has been a record of six reported breeding pairs of ospreys throughout Cumbria this year, which is the highest number since the bird returned to breed in England in 2001. The Roudsea birds attempted to build a nest on a nearby electricity pylon last year, just outside the reserve. This blew down during last winter’s storms and Electricity North West eagerly offered to fund the construction of a new nesting platform in the nature reserve, on top of a 30 metre-tall Scots pine tree, and within sight of good viewing positions on the reserve. The platform was erected on the 17 March 2014 and by the 2 April the newly arrived ospreys had adopted the platform and were already starting to build their nest. Little is yet known about the parents – many breeding osprey in England are ringed to help track their movements and support conservation efforts but Roudsea’s breeding female bird is unringed, and could have come from Scotland or Scandinavia. She will soon start her return migration to Africa, whilst dad will remain for the next few weeks to make sure his offspring know how to fish, before they too return south. Roudsea Wood and Mosses National Nature Reserve in South Cumbria is one of the most important wildlife sites in England. An extensive mosaic of ancient woodlands, raised bogs, fens, reedbeds and saltmarsh provide habitat for a range of species including otter, kingfisher, dormouse, several species of rare butterfly and insects. Visitors to the reserve, have had unbridled views in the last few weeks of the attentive parents, catching and bringing in fish, including mullet to feed the hungry and fast developing young. Rob Petley Jones, Natural England’s Senior Reserve Manager at Roudsea Wood and Mosses National Nature Reserve said; “We are overjoyed at their breeding success - It’s been brilliant to watch the family’s progress. We’ve worked hard here for many years to manage the site for wildlife and feel rewarded that the conditions are right to encourage these rare birds to nest here. We’ve all been keeping our fingers crossed that the birds would return after last year’s initial nesting attempt, and it was great to have the enthusiastic support from Electricity North West who funded the construction of the new platform. Visitors to the reserve have also been fascinated with views of the male bird regularly bringing back huge flapping fish for his mate and their growing offspring. We look forward to welcoming them back again next year.” Daniel Garner, delivery manager for Electricity North West, said: “We were delighted to be able to help Natural England by sponsoring the new Osprey nesting platform at Roudsea Wood and Mosses National Nature Reserve. These amazing birds previously nested on a nearby electricity pylon, which could have potentially caused issues if our engineers needed to carry out maintenance work, so it was important that we offered them a safe alternative. We’re looking forward to welcoming the ospreys back next year and will continue to assist Natural England in any way we can.” Natural England also has plans to install a webcam and improve access at the reserve for people to view the birds if they return next year. 2015 will also mark the Diamond Jubilee for the reserve.

Today, there are between 200 and 250 pairs of breeding osprey in Britain, but most of these are in Scotland, where it recolonized in 1954. There are also a small number of breeding pairs in Rutland Water and Kielder Forest , Northumberland. They visit the UK from Africa to breed in late March, before making the return journey in September. They feed exclusively on fish, which they catch with impressive dives into the water. About Roudsea Woods and National Nature Reserves Most of Natural England’s National Nature Reserves are free and open to the public. Natural England lease Roudsea Woods from the Holker Estate, and a permit to visit this nature reserve is required. This is available from Rob Petley-Jones, Senior Reserves Manager: rob.petley-jones@naturalengland.org.uk . Natural England is drawing up plans to improve access for those wanting to view the birds when they hopefully return next year. National Nature Reserves are some of the very finest sites in England for wildlife and geology, and provide great opportunities for people to experience nature. They have been established to protect and manage the special wildlife habitats, species and geological features that occur there. These features are of national and often international importance, and many NNRs are important for study and research. Almost all NNRs have some form of access provision – many are fully open throughout the year. There are 224 throughout England."
/government/news/badger-control-measures-authorised-in-west-gloucestershire-and-west-somerset,"Natural England today confirmed that all the criteria have been met to allow the second of four years of badger culling to start in west Gloucestershire and west Somerset, to prevent the spread of bovine tuberculosis (bTB). Badger control measures authorised in west Gloucestershire and west Somerset  Natural England Operations in these areas where TB is rife will be carried out under the existing four-year licences which allow six weeks of culling to take place every year between 1 June and 31 January*. Start dates for culling activity will be decided by the licensed companies. Under the terms of the authorisation letters, licensees have been set a minimum number of badgers to be removed – these are 615 in Gloucestershire and 316 in Somerset. A maximum number of badgers has also been set (1091 in Gloucestershire, 785 in Somerset) to safeguard the local populations: [InlineAttachment:1] [InlineAttachment:2] The minimum and maximum numbers are based on the estimates of the badger populations in 2013 set out in the Independent Expert Panel’s report, and the new evidence we have of badger activity on the ground in 2014. In light of the advice provided by the Independent Expert Panel regarding the significant difficulties in achieving accurate estimates of badger populations, Natural England will keep the minimum number under review and will, if appropriate, provide further advice on the level of culling effort and badger removal required to achieve an effective cull. Natural England has worked closely together with Defra and the Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency (AHVLA) to develop a robust monitoring regime for this year’s culls in Somerset and Gloucestershire. A Government-approved training programme has been put in place to improve shooting accuracy. Natural England will monitor controlled shooting through field observations to record accuracy in 60 cases. Vets from AHVLA will carry out post-mortem examinations on at least 60 randomly-selected badgers from each cull area to assess accuracy of controlled shooting. These measures have been put in place to implement the recommendations made by the Independent Experts Panel following last year’s pilots. Notes to editors Licensing criteria Licensees have formally advised Natural England: that sufficient funds are in place to complete control operations the specific dates on which control operations will take place details of persons authorised to carry out control activity Natural England has confirmed to licensees: the permitted maximum and minimum numbers of badgers that will be subject to control operations Guidance to Natural England (specifies the criteria Natural England need to take account of in developing and issuing licences). *Close seasons controlled shooting: 1 Feb – 31 May cage-trapping and shooting: 1 December – 31 May cage-trapping and vaccination: 1 December - 30 April Further information Defra has information on best practice guidance, monitoring and numbers.

/government/news/one-in-five-vascular-plant-species-are-threatened-with-extinction,"'A Vascular Plant Red List for England' was launched at Kew Gardens today, presenting a comprehensive and objective analysis of changes in the distribution of our native flora to identify our most threatened species. One in five vascular plant species are threatened with extinction  Natural England The new Red List reveals that a fifth of England’s wildflower species are under threat, with the majority of these threatened species suffering a decline of 30% or more. Wildflowers associated with infertile soils, open habitats or highly acid or basic habitats, such as great sundew (Drosera anglica) or burnt-tip orchid (Orchis ustulata), fare particularly badly. The analysis also identifies species that have suffered such severe declines in lowland areas of England that they meet the ‘threatened’ criteria, despite being still relatively widespread and common in upland areas. These include the frog orchid (Coeloglossum viride), grass-of-Parnassus (Parnassia palustris) and common butterwort (Pinguicula vulgaris). One major cause for concern is that a suite of wildflowers, once common and widespread across England have now declined across their entire range and are now close to being listed as threatened. These include familiar species such as as ragged-robin (Silene flos-cuculi), harebell (Campanula rotundifolia), quaking grass (Briza media), common rock-rose (Helianthemum nummularium) and cross-leaved heath (Erica tetralix). The Red List is the product of a partnership of 12 scientists from the Botanical Society of Britain and Ireland (BSBI), Natural England, the Centre of Ecology and Hydrology, the Natural History Museum, Plantlife and Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. Red List lead author Dr Pete Stroh (BSBI) said “Whilst many of these ‘near threatened’ species are still found within nature reserves, they once had a much greater presence outside of protected areas. Following the widespread destruction or modification of vast swathes of unprotected countryside - particularly in lowland England - over the past 60 years, it is perhaps not so surprising to find out that these species have undergone such severe declines”. Ian Taylor, specialist for the conservation of vascular plant species at Natural England, said: “The scientific rigour brought to the England Red List by a partnership of the country’s leading botanical organisations will enable us to target our conservation efforts more precisely and with greater confidence on those plants, habitats and landscapes revealed to be most urgently in need.” The new Red List will play a vital role in helping Natural England to identify additional country-level priority taxa requiring conservation action, whether through appropriate management of Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), designation of new SSSIs, targeting of agri-environment schemes and land management advice in the ‘wider countryside’, or projects funded by the Species Recovery Programme (SRP).

/government/news/species-success-at-the-stiperstones-national-nature-reserve,"Shropshire wildlife has enjoyed a successful season at the Stiperstones NNR.  Species success at the Stiperstones National Nature Reserve  Natural England The wild, upland reserve in south west Shropshire is an important habitat for some of our rarest and most enigmatic species including raven, snipe, common lizard and emperor moth. Natural England looks after it in a bid to conserve and encourage these rarities as well as new species that might be attracted to its rich environment. 2014 highlights include: 976 greater butterfly orchids were counted in the hay meadows - double the figure recorded last year whinchat re-recorded as a possible breeding bird after it was thought to have been extinct on the Stiperstones record numbers of red grouse have bred on the moorland, exceeding 100 birds for the first time since records began 20 years ago. The Stiperstones population is the southern-most naturally occurring population an excellent year for emperor moths, which were noted in larger numbers earlier in the summer A well-attended 24 hour bioblitz – where members of the public are invited to find and record as many different species as possible around the reserve – produced records of rare or previously unrecorded species for the reserve. These included: petty whin, an uncommon flowering plant species that has not been recorded for some years in the Stiperstones and was re-found by botanists John Handley and Mark Duffell heather shieldbug, which has not been recorded since 2002 northern rustic moth, which has not been recorded on the Stiperstones since the 1890s on the Devil’s Chair The wildlife is surveyed each year to help the reserve staff improve and target specific conservation work on the site. It also helps them to build up a picture of the longer term population trends, which could be affected by habitat change or new species. Natural England’s senior reserve manager, Simon Cooter, said: We work hard on the reserve to protect and encourage the wildlife, including red grouse, whinchat, orchid and emperor moths. However the weather can affect numbers from year to year and it’s great when we have seasons like this when the wildlife really does thrive. We’ve been out with volunteers, counting and recording throughout the summer. We use the information to help continuously improve the work we do on site. We also submit the data to the local record centre, which helps them to build up a longer term picture of how the wildlife in Shropshire is faring and changing. The atmospheric and wild upland reserve occupies a stunning 10 km ridge in south west Shropshire and within the Shopshire Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. It has inspired writers including Mary Webb, D H Lawrence and Malcolm Saville. The reserve provides a fantastic combination of geological, landscape and wildlife features, along with wild, dramatic scenery and a wealth of stories about local myths and folklore.

/government/news/st-hildas-to-enjoy-a-bat-free-christmas,"A Natural England project has helped St Hilda’s church in North Yorkshire enjoy a bat-free Christmas. St Hilda’s to enjoy a bat-free Christmas  Natural England For the first time in years, the congregation of St Hilda’s Church will enjoy ‘Carols by Candlelight’ without disturbance from their resident bats. Bats are still using the Saxon church to roost and breed, but works to exclude them from the interior have finished, meaning the festive carol service on Wednesday 17 December will take place bat-free. The small church on the fringes of the North York Moors National Park is home to a large number of Natterer’s bats, which were creating widespread mess with their droppings and urine when flying within the church. Natural England has worked closely with St Hilda’s church over many years to manage the problems caused by bats. An extensive research project began in 2013 to gather data about how bats were using the church, with radio tracking revealing their dependency on it for breeding purposes. Roost locations within the fabric of the building were identified, with data confirming that the well-being of the young was not dependent on bats flying inside the church. Works to exclude the bats from the church interior began after the 2013 breeding season, and progress was monitored closely over the spring and summer months this year. Results confirmed that the same numbers of bats – and in many cases the same, ringed individuals – were returning to the church to breed. Monitoring will continue at St Hilda’s for at least another 4 years, to ensure the bat population continues to thrive and the solutions remain effective. Although bats are common residents in many churches, the problems faced by St Hilda’s were exceptional. The surrounding landscape provides excellent bat habitat, supporting a large population, and the church’s small size magnifies the impact of that population on its interior. Natural England is currently working with partners to identify funding for similar projects in other churches also encountering significant problems with bats. Natural England senior adviser, Stephen Rudd, said: We know it has been a long and drawn out process for St Hilda’s and appreciate their patience whilst we have worked to find a lasting solution to this issue. The works and research carried out at St Hilda’s have taught us a great deal about the importance of such structures to local bat populations and how they can be proofed so that bats and congregations can co-exist in harmony. If we are successful in attracting funding, then we hope to fund similar solutions for other churches which they would not otherwise be able to afford. Background The research project at St Hilda’s was carried out by the Animal and Plant Health Agency under contract from Natural England. The bid to fund similar projects is being developed in partnership with English Heritage ; Church Buildings Council ; Churches Conservation Trust ; National Trust and Bat Conservation Trust . Bats and their habitats have had a high level of protection under British law since 1981. Deliberately capturing, disturbing, injuring and killing bats is prohibited, as is damaging or destroying their breeding sites and roosts. Licences to undertake otherwise prohibited activities are issued by Natural England."

/government/news/natural-england-and-ponies-on-dartmoor,"Dartmoor's ponies play an important role in the mix of grazing animals that maintain the landscape of Dartmoor. Natural England and ponies on Dartmoor  Natural England Dartmoor ponies are widely recognised as a key part of the culture and identity of Dartmoor. Along with cattle and sheep, the ponies play an important role in the mix of grazing animals that maintain the landscape of Dartmoor. There is no truth to the suggestion that Natural England is trying to “replace ponies with cattle on Dartmoor”. We are quite clear that for many reasons the ponies should be a valued part of the landscape of Dartmoor long into the future. They are one of a mix of grazing animals which help improve the wildlife value of the area. Alongside the Dartmoor National Park Authority, our local team work with the Friends of the Dartmoor Hill Pony, the Dartmoor Hill Pony Association, the commoners’ associations and other interested parties to help ensure that is the case. In trying to ensure that Dartmoor is conserved and enhanced for the future, Natural England has a keen interest in the way that ponies can help look after nature on the moor. We have worked closely with farmers, commoners, the National Park Authority and others over many years to look after and enhance Dartmoor. Primarily this has been by developing management agreements which provide financial support to farmers and commoners to help them with their careful management of their livestock and Dartmoor’s landscape. It is the commoners’ associations and individual agreement holders who make the detailed decisions on how agreement payments are shared and the numbers of ponies, sheep and cattle on the moor at any one time. Grazing by both cattle and ponies can be beneficial for nature on Dartmoor. It is the overall stocking level and timing that is most important to helping nature thrive. Natural England owns a small herd of Dartmoor ponies which do an important job helping us to manage our East Dartmoor Woods and Heaths National Nature Reserve , as well as adding greatly to the enjoyment of our visitors."

Rabbits: how to control  numbers Wildlife and habitat conservation Natural England The content on this page is in beta and may be updated frequently. For general advice about controlling pests, see Pest control on your property . Your responsibility to control rabbit numbers You must obey the law to control rabbit numbers on your property or land. England (excluding the City of London and Isles of Scilly) was declared a rabbit clearance area under the Pests Act 1954. You must control rabbits on your land in this area. If this is not possible you must stop them causing damage to adjoining crops by putting up rabbit proof fencing. If you don’t take action the Secretary of State for the Environment can enforce control and prosecute if this action is not taken. You can control rabbits using these methods: gas traps and snares fencing ferreting shooting Control with gas You should use someone trained in the use of gassing products if you choose this method of control. See the HSE information sheet: Gassing of rabbits and vertebrate pests for more information. Catch with traps and snares It is an offence to cause unnecessary suffering to a rabbit caught in a trap or snare. You can use cage traps, drop box traps or spring traps, but you must: check traps and snares once a day humanely despatch any rabbits you catch only use approved spring traps You must not: place them where they will be exposed to severe weather place them near a fox earth or badger sett use self-locking snares See Animal welfare and Animal welfare in severe weather for more information. Exclude rabbits with fencing There are 3 types of fencing: electric netting electric strained wire (similar to the kind used to manage cattle and sheep) permanent wire-mesh netting Fencing restrictions You need Secretary of State agreement to put up fencing on Scheduled Monuments. You should not put up fencing on archaeological sites. Some wildlife habitats and species depend on rabbit grazing, so you should consider wildlife interests when deciding where to put up rabbit fencing. You should install badger gates if the fence crosses any badger runs. Use ferrets You can send ferrets into the burrow system. The ferrets drive rabbits into nets, which are placed over the burrow entrances or to waiting guns that shoot them as they bolt from tunnel entrances. See also “When you can shoot rabbits” below. When you can shoot rabbits If you are the occupier of land you can shoot rabbits on your land during the day and can authorise in writing one other person to do so. That person must be part of your household, one of your staff, or be employed for reward to specifically control the rabbits. If the owner of the shooting rights for your land does not agree to destroy the rabbits themselves nor allow you to use extra shooters, you can apply to Natural England for authority to do so. [Contact:2403] You can shoot rabbits at night only if you are: an owner/occupier with shooting rights a landlord/landlady who has reserved their shooting rights a shooting tenant not in occupation who has derived the shooting rights from the owner an occupier, or one other person authorised by the occupier in writing, where the occupier has written authority from someone with the shooting rights See Hunting game and wildlife for more information on penalties for illegal hunting and causing unnecessary suffering to an animal. Make a complaint about rabbit damage If you’re suffering damage from rabbits coming from neighbouring land, you should contact the landowner concerned first, to agree how to resolve the issue. If your neighbour fails to control them, you can make a complaint to Natural England using form A02. More details on how this will be dealt with are available on the form page. If rabbits live on land owned by Network Rail, you should telephone Network Rail national helpline 03457 11 41 41."

/government/news/natural-england-welcomes-the-decision-to-extend-the-yorkshire-dales-and-lake-district-national-parks,"The Secretary of State Elizabeth Truss MP has today confirmed extensions to the Lake District and Yorkshire Dales National Parks.   Natural England welcomes the decision to extend the Yorkshire Dales and Lake District National Parks  Natural England The confirmed variation to the Lake District National Park will include an additional area of land totalling approximately 27 square miles, situated in Cumbria. It will include land: to the east, to include an area from Birkbeck fells Common to Whinfell Common to the south, to include an area from Helsington Barrows to Sizergh Fell, an area north of Sizergh Castle and part of the Lyth valley The confirmed variation to the Yorkshire Dales National Park will include an additional area of land totalling approximately 161 square miles, situated in Cumbria and, for the first time, an area of Lancashire: to the north, to include parts of the Orton Fells, the northern Howgill Fells, Wild Boar Fell, and Mallerstang to the south, to include Barbon, Casterton and Leck fells, the River Lune and part of Firbank Fell and other fells to the west of the River Lune These new areas join the ranks of some of the country’s most highly protected landscapes and amount to the most significant addition to England’s National Parks since the confirmation of the South Downs in 2009. Speaking in the Yorkshire Dales National Park today, Natural England’s Chairman Andrew Sells, added: I very much welcome the Secretary of State’s decision to extend the Yorkshire Dales and Lake District National Parks in line with the recommendations made by Natural England. The Chancellor’s Northern Powerhouse depends upon the ‘natural capital’ provided by our iconic National Parks. They represent some of England’s most treasured natural assets. With international appeal, their stunning landscapes stand out as a beacon to the people who come to enjoy them whilst their intrinsic value drives the communities, businesses and biodiversity they support. Extending these today confirms their great importance and provides them with the recognition they richly deserve. Natural England has special responsibilities for creating National Parks and Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty and reviewing their boundaries. The potential to extend the Lake District and Yorkshire Dales National Parks was considered for a number of years and Natural England began work in 2009 to look at whether the boundaries should be changed. Detailed assessments were made of the areas, which used the 3 criteria for National Park status: the natural beauty of the proposed extensions; the opportunities that they provide for open-air recreation, and the desirability of looking after them as National Parks. Impact assessments also helped identify the environmental, social, economic and recreational impacts that designation would be likely to bring. Two phases of face-to-face and online consultations were held, to ask for opinions from the public, local communities, statutory agencies, interested organisations and local authorities. Over two-thirds of respondents said they were in favour of extending the National Parks and there was widespread consensus that the proposals met the criteria. Natural England then issued a legal document known as a variation order which paved the way for today’s decision by the Secretary of State. For further information including maps and next steps, see the decision page . Read Defra’s announcement ."

This change of policy , and the remapping of common land which has taken place in 2015, means that the commons listed on this page now have more eligible area to allocate for certain years. Farmers who claimed on one or more of these commons can fill in a claim form to apply to receive SPS entitlements they should have been given in 2005, as well as any payments they could have received in the years from 2009 to 2014. The table below lists all the commons that have additional eligible area available for farmers to claim and the scheme years for which the area is available. This is based on: the new rules for allocating commons area, and the mapping of the eligible area of commons for direct payments.

/guidance/bps-2016-land-use-codes,"What land use codes to use in an application for the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) in 2016.  BPS 2016 land use codes  Rural Payments Agency When farmers apply for the Basic Payment Scheme using the Rural Payments service , they must use the codes on this page to declare what they use their land for. To search the lists on this page, click ‘CTRL’ and ‘F’ and type in the term or code you’re looking for. To print the codes, click ‘CTRL’ and ‘P’. You can also download a PDF copy of the [InlineAttachment:1]. There are codes for: agricultural land non-agricultural land Countryside Stewardship options with multiple crops There are also some codes you must not use for BPS. Read more about BPS 2016 . Agricultural land Land use codes for agricultural land are given below for: permanent grassland and permanent grassland buffer strips permanent crops arable land: temporary grassland, fallow land, arable buffer strips, hedges and arable land exempt from greening arable land: arable crops for crop diversification arable land: leguminous and nitrogen-fixing crops for crop diversification and ecological focus areas arable land: catch and cover crops for ecological focus areas Permanent grassland and permanent grassland buffer strips Land use Code Description Permanent grassland PG01 All land you are planning to count as permanent grassland for BPS. Also use this code for strips and margins of permanent grassland if you want these to count towards your total area of grassland to meet a greening exemption or to limit your area of arable land subject to crop diversification. Otherwise you can include strips and margins of permanent grassland under the main land use of the parcel and they don’t need to be separately identified. Read the BPS 2016 scheme rules for more information on permanent grassland. Permanent crops Land use Code Description Permanent crops other than nursery crops and short rotation coppice TC01 Permanent crops are crops that occupy the land for 5 years or more (other than permanent grassland) and nursery crops and provide repeated harvests. They include nursery crops short rotation (code NU01) and short rotation coppice (code SR01). Multi-annual/perennial crops include: Almonds Apples Apricots Artichoke Asparagus Avocados Bilberries Blackberries Blueberries Cherries Chestnuts Citrus fruit Cranberries Currants English Chamomile Figs Gooseberries Grapes Guavas Hazelnuts Hops Hyssop Lavender Loganberries Macadamia nuts Mangos Mangosteens Melissa Mint Miscanthus Mulberries Papayas and Locust beans Peaches Pears Pecans Pineapples Pine nuts Pistachios Plantains Plums Raspberries Reed canary grass Rhubarb Rosemary Sloes and Quinces Walnuts Yarrow Other fruits under the genus ‘Vaccinium’ are also permanent crops.

They include: Vine and root stock nurseries Fruit tree and berry nurseries Ornamental nurseries Mixed nurseries of forest trees (except those for the holding’s own requirements grown in woodland) Nurseries of trees and bushes for planting in gardens, parks, at the road side and on embankments Nursery crops do not include Christmas trees unless they are grown in nurseries for later transplantation. Short rotation coppice SR01 Short rotation coppice includes areas planted with tree species that consist of woody, perennial crops, the rootstock or stools remaining in the ground after harvesting, with new shoots emerging in the following season. The maximum harvest cycle is 20 years. The eligible species for short rotation coppice are: Alder (Alnus) Ash (Fraxinus excelsior) Birch (Betula) Hazel (Corylus avellana) Hornbeam (Carpinus spp) Lime (Tilia cordata) Poplar (Populus spp) Sweet chestnut (Castanea sativa) Sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus) Willow (Salix spp) Arable land: temporary grassland, fallow land, arable buffer strips, hedges and arable land exempt from greening Land use Code Description Temporary grassland TG01 All land you are planning to count as temporary grassland for BPS. Also use this code for strips and margins of temporary grassland if you want these to count towards your total area of grassland to meet a greening exemption or as a single ‘crop’ for crop diversification. If the strips meet the fallow rules for greening and you want them to count as fallow land for crop diversification or EFA, use the land use code for ‘Land lying fallow’ (FA01). Otherwise you can include the areas of strips and margins of temporary grassland under the land use code you are using for the main land use of the parcel and they don’t need to be separately identified. Land lying fallow FA01 All land you are planning to count as fallow land for BPS or as part of your ecological focus area. Also use this code for strips and margins of fallow land if you want these to count towards your total area of fallow land to meet a greening exemption or as a single ‘crop’ for crop diversification. Otherwise you can include the areas of strips and margins of fallow land under the land use code you are using for the main land use of the parcel and they don’t need to be separatey identified. Wild bird mixes can be coded under a number of different land use codes, as long as in your individual example matches the criteria, for example: a) as a mixed crop if there is an area where a seed mixture is sown, this area must be counted as a single crop for crop diversification, it doesn’t matter what crops are included in the mix. b) as fallow land (crop diversification) when it is land which has no crop production or grazing on it, but is maintained in a state suitable for grazing or cultivation. To count as a ‘crop’ for crop diversification, fallow land must be kept fallow from 1 May 2016 to 30 June 2016. c) as fallow land (EFA) when it is land which has no crop production or grazing on it, but is maintained in a state suitable for grazing or cultivation. To count as part of an ecological focus area (EFA), fallow land must be kept fallow from 1 January 2016 to 30 June 2016. Farmers can grow or plant wild-bird seed mixes, pollen sources and nectar sources on their EFA fallow land during the fallow period. These must be an unharvestable mix of at least 2 crops that support wildlife and pollinators (advisers from the ‘Campaign for the Farmed Environment’ can help farmers choose). Wild-bird seed mixes should be an area with a balanced combination of small-seed bearing crops, for example Barley, Triticale, Kale, Quinoa, Linseed, Millet, Mustard, Fodder radish, Sunflower. This will benefit over-wintering birds. Pollen sources and nectar sources should be in an area with a mixture of nectar-rich plants, for example Red clover, Alsike clover, Bird’s foot trefoil, Sainfoin, Musk mallow or Common knapweed. This will benefit nectar feeding insects like butterflies and bumble bees. Crops under water and leguminous crops Use the appropriate code(s) listed in the arable land tables All land you are planning to count as crops under water or leguminous crops to meet a greening exemption or for crop diversification purposes. Hedge BF11 - Half Hedge, BF12 - adjacent hedge A hedge that you want to use as part of your ecological focus area. Use ‘BF11 - Half Hedge’ for the inside half of a hedge in land parcel. These lengths will be shown in column D5 on your application summary. Use ‘BF12 - Adjacent Hedge’ as well as BF11 if you to want to add the other ‘outside’ half of the hedge but it can’t be claimed in another arable land parcel. For example where: - a length of hedge juts out into an arable parcel at the farmer’s disposal, so both sides of the hedge count within the parcel (if the hedge is a minimum of 20 metres long) - a hedge forms the boundary between an arable parcel at the farmer’s disposal and a non-agricultural feature such as a wood or a road, and the farmer is responsible for maintaining both sides of the hedge (so can claim on both sides of it) - a hedge is between an arable field at the farmer’s disposal and a parcel of permanent grassland, and the farmer is responsible for managing both sides of the hedge - a hedge is between an arable field at the farmers disposal and a parcel not at the farmers disposal (for example, land that belongs to a neighbour), and the farmer is responsible for managing both sides of the hedge. Where any of these situations occur in a particular land parcel, enter the length/s of the affected hedges using both codes (so that they are entered twice, once as BF11 and once as BF12). This means that both sides of the hedge will be counted when we work out what your hedges are worth for EFA. These lengths will be shown in column D6 on your application summary. Buffer strip BF15 A buffer strip of permanent grassland, temporary grassland or fallow land that you want to use as part of your ecological focus area.
